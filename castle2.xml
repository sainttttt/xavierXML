    <description><i>Interior Castle</i> is the work of 16th 
century Carmelite nun and Christian mystic St. Teresa of 
Avila. She wrote <i>Interior Castle</i> as a spiritual guide to 
union with God. Her inspiration for the work came from a 
vision she received from God. In it, there was a crystal 
globe with seven mansions, with God in the innermost 
mansion. St. Teresa interpreted this vision as an allegory for the 
soul's relationship with God; each mansion represents one place on a 
path towards the "spiritual marriage"--i.e. union--with God in the 
seventh mansion. One begins on this path through prayer and meditation. 
She also describes the resistance that the Devil places in various 
rooms, to keep believers from union with God. Throughout, she provides 
encouragements and advice for spiritual development. Beyond its 
spiritual merit, <i>Interior Castle</i> also contains much literary 
merit as 
a 
piece of Spanish Renaissance literature. A spiritually challenging book, 
<i>Interior Castle</i> stands on par with other great works of this 
time, 
such 
as <i>Dark Night of the Soul</i>.<br/><br/>Tim Perrine<br/>CCEL Staff

<p class="First" id="ii-p1">IN
this new edition the wording has been revised and condensed, chiefly with a
view to rendering the translation more pregnant. Only one passage (VI. Mansion,
ch. v. r 3) has been substantially changed, in conformity with an explanation
received from a high authority. It is admittedly a very difficult passage which
appears to have been misunderstood by nearly all translators; but it is
gratifying to notice that the new French translation by the Carmelite nuns of
Anderlecht agrees with our interpretation. The editor is under an obligation to
that translation for several interesting facts embodied in the Introduction and
in the notes to the text.</p>

<h1 style="margin-top:24pt" id="iii-p2.1">INTRODUCTION</h1>

<p class="First" id="iii-p3">SAINT TERESA began to write the <i>Interior Castle</i>
on June 2, 1577, Trinity Sunday, and completed it on the eve of St. Andrew,
November 29, of the same year. But there was a long interruption of five
months,<note n="1" id="iii-p3.1"><i>Castle</i>, Mansions v. ch. iv. I.</note>&#160; so that the actual time spent in the
composition of this work was reduced to about four weeks&#8212;a fortnight for the
first, and another fortnight for the second half of the book. The rapidity with
which it was written is easily explained by the fact that the Saint had
conceived its plan some time previously. On January 17, 1577, she had written
to her brother, Don Lorenzo de Cepeda, at Avila: &#8216;I have asked the bishop&#8212;Don
Alvaro Mendoza&#8212;for my book (the <i>Life</i>)
because I shall perhaps complete it by adding those new favours our Lord has
lately granted me. With these one may even compose a new work of considerable
size, provided God grants me the grace of explaining myself; otherwise the loss
will be of small account.&#8217;<note n="2" id="iii-p3.2"><i>Letters of St. Teresa</i>, Vol. ii.</note>&#160; She never asked for permission to write
anything, but waited until she received a command from her superiors, which, in
this case, came from <pb n="10" id="iii-Page_10"/>
Father Jerome Gracian, superior of the Discalced J. Carmelites of the Provinces
of Andalusia and Castille, and from Don Alonso Velasquez, canon of Toledo,
afterwards bishop of Osma.<note n="3" id="iii-p3.3">The
French Carmelite nuns in their new translation, <i>&#338;uvres compl&#232;tes de Sainte Th&#233;r&#232;se</i>, t. vi, Introduction, p. 5,
quoting the <i>A&#241;o Teresiano</i>, t. vii ad
7 July, and Father Gracian&#8217;s <i>Dilucidario</i>,
as well as his additions to Ribera, show the exact share of Fr. Gracian and Dr.
Velasquez in the preliminaries of this work.</note>&#160; The Saint was not in good health at the time;
she repeatedly complains of noises in the head and other infirmities, but,
worst of all, she was weighed down by troubles and anxieties resulting from the
action of the superiors of the Order and of the Papal Nuncio against the nuns
and friars of the Reform. Matters became even more serious when, in October,
the nuns of the Incarnation of Avila proceeded to the election of a new
prioress. Notwithstanding the prohibition of the provincial, fifty-five
electors recorded their votes in favour of the Saint and were immediately
declared excommunicated. The whole work of the Reform seemed on the brink of
ruin, the Saint, as well as all her friends, was in disgrace, subject to
obloquy and ill-treatment.</p>

<p id="iii-p4">No
trace of these trials is to be found in the <i>Interior
Castle</i>. Saint Teresa possessed the power of concentration of thought in a
marvellous degree. The early mornings and late evenings were devoted to the
composition of the book, while the rest of the day was taken up by the affairs
of the Order. Mother Mary of the Nativity, a member of the <pb n="11" id="iii-Page_11"/>community
of Toledo, where the book was begun, declared afterwards,<note n="4" id="iii-p4.1">Fuente, <i>Obras de Santa Teresa de Jesus</i>. Edit. 1881, Vol. vi, p. 278.</note>&#160; that she often saw her writing, generally
after Holy Communion, her face resplendent, with such rapidity and so absorbed
in her occupation that she seemed undisturbed by, and in fact quite unconscious
of, any noise that was made. Mother Mariana of the Angels<note n="5" id="iii-p4.2"><i>Ibid</i>. p. 178. A somewhat similar incident is reported by Mother
Anne of the Incarnation (<i>Ibid</i>. p.
213), but it appears to be wrongly brought into connection with the composition
of the <i>Castle</i>. The nun in question
had belonged to the convent of St. Joseph at Segovia at an earlier period, but
there is no evidence that St. Teresa visited this place in the course of the
six months during which she composed this work. The Bollandists, indeed,
maintain that it was commenced at Toledo, continued at Segovia and completed at
Avila (n. 1541), but their sole authority for including Segovia is the passage
in question, which, however, must refer to some other work of the Saint. The
sister, passing St. Teresa&#8217;s door, saw her writing, her face being lit up as by
a bright light. She wrote very fast without making any corrections. After an
hour, it being about midnight, she ceased and the light disappeared. The Saint
then knelt down and remained in prayer for three hours, after which she went to
sleep.</note>&#160; reports having heard from the same witness,
that entering her cell one day to deliver a message, the holy Mother was just
beginning a new sheet of her book. While taking off her spectacles to listen to
the message she was seized by a trance in which she remained for several hours.
The nun, terrified at this, did not stir, but kept her eyes steadily on the
Saint. When she came to, it was seen that the paper, previously blank, was
covered with writing. Noticing that her visitor had discovered it, Saint Teresa
put the paper quietly in the box. <pb n="12" id="iii-Page_12"/>Another
nun, Mary of St. Francis, left the following declaration: &#8216;I know that our holy
Mother wrote four books, the <i>Life</i>,
the <i>Way of Perfection</i>, the <i>Foundations</i>, and the <i>Mansions</i>, which I have seen her writing.
Once, while she was composing the last-named work, I entered to deliver a
message, and found her so absorbed that she did not notice me; her face seemed
quite illuminated and most beautiful. After having listened to me she said:
&#8220;Sit down, my child, and let me write what our Lord has told me ere I
forget it,&#8221; and she went on writing with great rapidity and without
stopping.&#8217;<note n="6" id="iii-p4.3">Fuente,
p. 223.</note>
</p>

<p id="iii-p5">Mary
of St. Joseph says she heard from Mary of the Nativity that Father Jerome
Gracian commanded the Saint to write the <i>Mansions</i>;
she, however, begged to be excused, because so many books having been written
by holy and learned men, there remained nothing for a woman to write. At length
she yielded under obedience. This nun (Mary of the Nativity) was frequently in
the Saint&#8217;s cell while she was writing and she noticed her resplendent face and
the almost preternatural velocity with which her hand travelled over the paper.<note n="7" id="iii-p5.1"><i>Ibid</i>. p. 255.</note></p>

<p id="iii-p6">Writing
to Mother Mary of St. Joseph, Prioress of Seville, November 8, 1581, St. Teresa
gives her a message for Father Rodrigo Alvarez, S. J.: &#8216;Our Father (Jerome
Gracian, then provincial) tells me that he has handed you a book written by me, <pb n="13" id="iii-Page_13"/>which
perhaps you do not feel inclined to read yourself. Kindly read to Father
Rodrigo Alvarez, at his next visit, the last Mansion, but under the seal of
confession, as he asks this in his superior wisdom. This is only for you two.
Tell him that the person he knows has arrived at this Mansion and enjoys the
peace there described; that she is entirely at rest, and that some grave
theologians have assured her that she is on a safe road. In case you could not
read these pages to him do not send him the book, for it might lead to
unpleasantness. Until I have his answer on this matter I will not write to him.
Give him my compliments.&#8217;</p>

<p id="iii-p7">At
the end of the original manuscript, before the epilogue (marked with Ihs.)
there is a notice in Father Alvarez&#8217; hand-writing to this effect: &#8216;The Mother
Prioress of the convent of Seville has read to me this seventh Mansion, whither
a soul may arrive in the present life. Let all the saints praise the infinite
goodness of God, Who communicates Himself to His creatures so that they truly
seek His glory and the salvation of their neighbour. What I feel and judge of
this matter is, that everything that has been read to me is conformable to
Catholic truth and in accordance with Holy Scripture and the teaching of the
Saints. Whosoever has read the doctrine of the Saints, such as the books of St.
Gertrude, St. Catharine of Siena, or St. Bridget of Sweden, and other saints
and spiritual writers, <pb n="14" id="iii-Page_14"/>will
clearly understand that the spirit of Mother Tireza (<i>sic</i>) of Jesus is true, since it leads to the same effects as are to
be found in the saints; and because this is in truth my judgment and opinion, I
have hereunto set my name, this, the 22nd day of February, 1582. P. Rodrigo
Alvarez.&#8217;<note n="8" id="iii-p7.1">Autograph,
fol. cx.</note>
</p>

<p id="iii-p8">The
work was copied, probably under the supervision of the Saint, who introduced
many changes; when completed the original was handed to Father Jerome Gracian
and to the Dominican, Fray Diego de Yanguas, for approval. Both, particularly
the former, made numerous corrections, which Fuente, not without reason, calls
impertinent, scratching out whole sentences and adding others. The book thus
revised must have enjoyed a certain celebrity, though not to the same extent as
the <i>Life</i>, to which St. Teresa herself
preferred it. Scarcely a week after its completion she wrote to Father Salazar,
S.J.: &#8216;If Se&#241;or Carillo [Salazar himself] came, the person in question [the
Saint] thinks he would find another jewel which in her opinion is superior to
the former [the <i>Life</i>]. This one
reflects nothing foreign to itself, but is resplendent in its own beauty. It is
enriched with more delicate enamels than the former, the workmanship, too, is
more perfect. For, as the person in question says, the jeweller was less experienced
when he fashioned the previous one. Moreover, the gold of the new <pb n="15" id="iii-Page_15"/>one
is of better quality than that of the former, though the precious stones are
not so well set. It has been done, as might be expected, according to the
designs of the Jeweller Himself.&#8217;<note n="9" id="iii-p8.1">December
7, 1577. <i>Letters</i> Vol. II.</note>&#160; Later on she wrote to Father Jerome Gracian:
The book I have written since seems to me superior [to the <i>Life</i>]; at least I had more experience when I wrote it.&#8217;<note n="10" id="iii-p8.2">Jan. 14,
1580. Letters Vol. IV:</note>
</p>

<p id="iii-p9">One
day, speaking with Mother Mary of Jesus on spiritual matters, she said that our
Lord had communicated so much to her since she had reached what she described
in the seventh Mansion,&#8212;the spiritual Marriage,&#8212;that she did not consider it
possible to advance further in this life, in the way of prayer, nor even to
wish to do so.<note n="11" id="iii-p9.1">Fuente,
<i>Obras</i>. <i>l.c.</i> p. 275.</note>
</p>

<p id="iii-p10">The
book was eagerly read by those who were able to obtain copies. At the
archiepiscopal Seminary at Salamanca it was read publicly after dinner; the
students, contrary to custom, sacrificing the recreation rather than miss so
edifying an instruction. The result was that several entered the religious
life, one becoming a Franciscan, two others, who had already taken their
degrees, joining the Discalced Carmelites.<note n="12" id="iii-p10.1"><i>l.c.</i> p. 217. </note>&#160; We also know of a lady who became a Poor
Clare through reading the <i>Interior Castle</i>.<note n="13" id="iii-p10.2"><i>Ibid</i>. p. 227.</note>&#160; The process of Beatification contains the
following evidence of Don Francisco de Mora, architect to Philip III: &#8216;The same
prioress (of a<pb n="16" id="iii-Page_16"/>convent
of Dominican nuns) being concerned about my salvation gave me a book in
manuscript, called <i>The Mansions</i>, by
Mother Teresa, hoping I should derive some benefit from it. I fear this was not
the case, but it made me acquainted with Teresa of Jesus, the foundress of the
Discalced Carmelite nuns, of whom I had not yet heard, but for whom I now felt
devotion.&#8217;<note n="14" id="iii-p10.3">Fuente,
<i>Obras</i>. p. 190.</note></p>

<p id="iii-p11">In
August 1586 it was decided to print Saint Teresa&#8217;s works, the Augustinian Fray
Luis de Leon being selected as editor, as he was unconcerned in the quarrels
raging round the Reform. Accordingly, the manuscript of the <i>Interior Castle</i> was handed to him. On
the first leaf he wrote the following note:</p>

<p id="iii-p12">&#8217;Many
passages of this book written by the holy Mother have been scored through,
other words being substituted or notes being added in the margin. Most of these
corrections are badly done, the original text being much better. It will be
noticed that the holy Mother&#8217;s sentences are superior and agree with the
context, which is not the case with the corrections. These improvements and
glosses may therefore be dispensed with. Having myself read and considered
everything with great care, it appears to me that the reader, too, should have
before him the words of the author who knew best what to say; for this reason I
have left out the additions, and have restored what has been changed, excepting
only a <pb n="17" id="iii-Page_17"/>few
corrections made by the writer herself. I beg of the reader that he would in
charity reverence the words and even the letters traced by so holy a hand, and
strive to understand what has been written. He will then see that there was no
need for corrections; should he fail to understand her, let him believe that
the writer knew what she said, and that her words cannot be tampered with if
they are not to lose their meaning; otherwise what was to the point will seem
out of place. This is how books become corrupted, useless, and are finally
lost.&#8217;<note n="15" id="iii-p12.1">Autograph.
fol. 1.</note>
</p>

<p id="iii-p13">When
Luis de Leon undertook the editing of St. Teresa&#8217;s writings he received a long
letter from Don Diego de Yepes, afterwards Bishop of Tarazona, a former friend
and confessor of the Saint, in which he records his personal recollections. I
shall only insert here what he says about the <i>Interior Castle</i>:</p>

<p id="iii-p14">&#8217;This
holy Mother desired to see the beauty of a soul in the state of grace, a thing
greatly to be coveted both for the sake of seeing and of possessing it. While
this desire lasted, she was commanded to write a treatise on prayer, of which
she had much personal experience. On the eve of the Blessed Trinity, while
considering what subject to choose for this treatise, God, Who disposes
everything in due season, fulfilled her wish and furnished a suitable subject.
He showed her a most beautiful globe <pb n="18" id="iii-Page_18"/>of
crystal, in the shape of a castle, with seven rooms, the seventh, situated in
the centre, being occupied by the King of glory, resplendent with the most
exquisite brilliancy, which shone through and adorned the remaining rooms. The
nearer these lay to the centre, the more did they partake of that wondrous
light. It did not, however, penetrate beyond the crystal, for everything round
about was a mass of darkness and impurity, full of toads and vipers and other
venomous animals.</p>

<p id="iii-p15">She
was still admiring this beauty which, by the grace of God dwells in the soul,
when, to! the light suddenly disappeared, and the crystal, wherein the King of
glory was still residing, became opaque and as dark as coal, emitting an
intolerable odour; the venomous animals, formerly held in check outside,
obtained admittance into the castle. The holy Mother wished that every one
should behold this vision, for she thought that no one having seen the beauty
and splendour of grace, which is forfeited by sin and replaced by such
repulsive misery, would ever dare to offend God.</p>

<p id="iii-p16">&#8217;She
told me this vision on the same day, for in this as well as in other things she
was so communicative that on the following morning she said to me: &#8220;How I
forgot myself yesterday! I cannot think how it could have happened. Those high
aspirations of mine, and the affection I have for you must have caused me to go
beyond all reasonable <pb n="19" id="iii-Page_19"/>limits.
God grant I may have derived some profit therefrom.&#8221; I promised her to say
nothing about it during her lifetime, but since her death I should like to make
it known to all men. From this vision she learnt four important matters.</p>

<p id="iii-p17">&#8217;First,
she came to understand this axiom, which in this form she had never heard of in
her life,<note n="16" id="iii-p17.1">See
<i>Life</i>, ch. xviii. 20. <i>Mansions</i> v. ch. i. 9. The ignorance of
the priest who had told her that God was only present by His grace, made a
lasting impression on St. Teresa. She was first undeceived by a Dominican.</note>&#160; that God is present in all things by His
essence, presence, and power. As she was deeply humble and submissive and
obedient to the doctrine of the Church and the teaching of the learned
ministers of God, she never rested until her revelations had been approved of
by her superiors and by theologians, and were shown to be conformable to Holy
Scripture. She went so far as to say that if all the angels of heaven said one
thing, and her superiors another, though she could not doubt that the former
were true angels, yet she would hold what was told her by her superiors,
because faith comes through these and there remains no room for deceit, whereas
revelations coming from angels might be illusionary.</p>

<p id="iii-p18">&#8217;With
such regard for obedience, she asked me one day at Toledo&#8212;probably at the time
when she saw the vision of the Castle&#8212;whether it was true that God was in all
things by His power, presence, <pb n="20" id="iii-Page_20"/>and
essence, to which I replied in the affirmative, explaining it as best I could
on the authority of St. Paul, particularly where he says &#8220;the sufferings
of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come that shall be
revealed in us,&#8221;<note n="17" id="iii-p18.1"><scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 18" id="iii-p18.2" parsed="|Rom|8|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.18">Rom.
viii. 18</scripRef>.</note>&#160; Laying stress on these words, &#8220;shall be
revealed in us,&#8221; she was so overjoyed that I was quite astonished. Though
in a way it seemed to me a kind of curiosity, I could not help thinking there
was some mystery about it, for she said: &#8220;This is the very thing.&#8221;</p>

<p id="iii-p19">&#8217;Secondly,
she was greatly surprised at the malice of sin, since, notwithstanding the
presence of God in these various ways, it prevents the soul from partaking of
that powerful light.</p>

<p id="iii-p20">&#8217;Thirdly,
she derived such humility and self-knowledge from this vision, that from that
moment she never thought of herself in all the good she was doing; for she
learnt that all the beauty of the soul emanates from that resplendent light,
and that the powers of the soul and of the body are enlivened and strengthened
by the Power established in the centre, whence comes all our good, so that we
have but a small share in our good works. All the good she did, she from this
moment referred to God as its principal author.</p>

<p id="iii-p21">&#8217;Fourthly,
she derived from it the subject of the book she was ordered to write on prayer,
comparing <pb n="21" id="iii-Page_21"/>the
seven rooms of the Castle with as many degrees of prayer, whereby we enter
within ourselves and draw nearer to God. So that, penetrating to the depths of
our soul and gaining perfect self-knowledge, we reach the seventh room where
God Himself dwells, with Whom we become united by as perfect a union as is
possible in the present life, being made partakers of His light and love.</p>

<p id="iii-p22">&#8217;I
will say no more of this vision and the <i>Mansions</i>,
because your Reverence must by now have seen this admirable book, and must know
with what accuracy, with what majestic doctrine, with what lucid examples she
describes the progress of the soul from the gate to the very centre. It is
clearly seen in this treatise how she communicated with our Lord, and how His
Majesty vouchsafed to place her in the centre and to unite her with Himself, as
she puts it, by the bonds of marriage and an inseparable union.&#8217;<note n="18" id="iii-p22.1">Fuente; pp.
131-133.</note>
</p>

<p id="iii-p23">After
the publication of the <i>Interior Castle</i>,
in 1588 at Salamanca, it became not only more widely known, but also more and
more appreciated. Francis Suarez, the great theologian of the Society of Jesus,
says in his deposition in the process of Beatification that he had read some of
St. Teresa&#8217;s works, particularly the <i>Mansions</i>,
which contain an absolutely safe doctrine and give proof of a wonderful spirit
of prayer and contemplation.<note n="19" id="iii-p23.1"><i>l.c.</i> 184.</note></p>

<p id="iii-p24"> <pb n="22" id="iii-Page_22"/>Thomas
Hurtado, professor of theology at Seville, speaks as follows:</p>

<blockquote id="iii-p24.1">
<p id="iii-p25">As often as I read the books of the holy Mother, I admire the wonderful manner in
which God instructed her in mystical theology for the sake of souls giving
themselves truly to familiar intercourse with His divine Majesty. But where I
most regret my inability of expressing in fitting terms my sentiments towards
this excellent teacher is when I look at, and refresh myself in that Castle
with its seven rooms; for there is seen the effect of infused knowledge such as
St. Denis received from St. Hierotheus<note n="20" id="iii-p25.1">Allusion to the famous <i>Mystical Theology</i> attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite, and long
considered the chief authority on this subject.</note>&#160; and both from St. Paul, and which has been
committed to writing in the famous book of <i>Mystical
Theology</i>. Hence comes, as from a fountain-head, notwithstanding the
obscurity (to our manner of thinking) of its language, the doctrine of the
great masters of the spiritual life such as Hugh of St. Victor, St. Bernard,
Ruysbroek, Tauler, Gerson, and many others whom I pass by.</p>

<p id="iii-p26">&#8217;Nevertheless,
I will boldly say that no one has given us water more limpid from that
Apostolical and Areopagitical well than the holy Mother Teresa, who, in her
books, but chiefly in the <i>Mansions</i>,
has cleared up in simple language the most difficult questions of this divine
theology, and has brought forth light from darkness, as it is <pb n="23" id="iii-Page_23"/>written:
(He) commanded light to shine out of darkness.&#8217;<note n="21" id="iii-p26.1"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. iv. 6" id="iii-p26.2" parsed="|2Cor|4|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.4.6">2 Cor. iv. 6</scripRef>.</note>&#160; Who has ever been able to show as clearly as
our Saint how God takes possession of the soul, how He unites Himself with its
substance, whence comes to the intellect the light of faith, to the will the
ardour of love, and to the senses the jubilation over His works? No one has
ever turned theory into practice in a more convincing or more catholic manner.
The most profound secrets of this supernatural wisdom are here treated with
such ease, so amiably, so delightfully, they are illustrated by such nice and
homely examples, that instead of awe-inspiring obscurity, we find lovely
flowers and the sweetness of love, through which, as through an avenue, the
soul passes onwards. When God made known His exalted doctrine to St. Dionysius
and other mystical writers, He made use of their own language and pen. But St.
Teresa in the <i>Mansions</i> is like the
light of dawn whose rays are not intercepted by the clouds of this world; like
a soft rain from above, whereby the soul grows and profits by its
communications with God. Until the teaching of this great door became known it
seemed as though God were inaccessible, being surrounded by darkness, through
which Moses and some other persons had to pass when approaching Him;<note n="22" id="iii-p26.3">The example
of Moses is scarcely to the point (cf. <scripRef passage="Exod. xxxiii. 11" id="iii-p26.4" parsed="|Exod|33|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.33.11">Exod. xxxiii. 11</scripRef>, and <scripRef passage="Num. xii. 7, 8" id="iii-p26.5" parsed="|Num|12|7|12|8" osisRef="Bible:Num.12.7-Num.12.8">Num. 
xii. 7, 8</scripRef>).</note>&#160; but they neither explained <pb n="24" id="iii-Page_24"/>the
manner nor showed the way whereby they came to the enjoyment of the sweetness
of the Spouse. Now, however, this way is clear and patent to all, having been
pointed out in the <i>Mansions</i>, in
language so straight and so methodical, and no longer such as could not be
understood, or required further explanation. In my opinion this holy writer
derived not only the substance of her teaching from infused knowledge, but even
the words with which she explains it.&#8217;<note n="23" id="iii-p26.6">Fuente, pp. 330-332.</note></p>
</blockquote>

<p id="iii-p27">Likewise
Don Alvaro de Villegas, canon of Toledo, expressed his opinion that the <i>Way of Perfection</i> and the <i>Interior Castle</i> contain &#8216;heavenly
doctrine.&#8217; The weight of the subject-matter, the propriety of the comparisons,
the force of the expressions, the consistency of the teaching, the sweetness of
her well-chosen, vivid words, the clearness of the arguments, all this proves
that she was guided by her heavenly Spouse, in Whom are hidden the treasures of
the wisdom of God; and that the Holy Ghost, Who more than once was seen resting
on her head like a dove, was dilating these works. Villegas does not believe
that any one could read them, as such books ought to be read, without becoming
himself a master of the spiritual life. For they are like heavenly dew,
rendering the soul fruitful in the matter of prayer.<note n="24" id="iii-p27.1"><i>l.c.</i> p. 334. These testimonies could be easily multiplied.</note></p>

<p id="iii-p28"> <pb n="25" id="iii-Page_25"/>It
would be a mistake to consider the <i>Interior
Castle</i> a complete treatise of mystical theology. Like St. Teresa&#8217;s other
works, it is intensely personal: she describes the road by which she has been
led, being well aware that others may be led in a different way. In the
heavenly Father&#8217;s house there are many mansions, not only seven, and many paths
lead to them. What gives the work such high value is, that it is the result of
a most searching inquiry into the various phases whereby a soul is gradually
transformed into the likeness of God Himself. Here St. Teresa is always at her
best. She takes nothing for granted, even her own personal experiences are
admitted only after having been fully investigated and found to be consistent
one with the other, and conformable to the teaching of the Church and the words
of Holy Scripture.</p>

<p id="iii-p29">Mystical
theology is generally divided into three parts, respectively called the
purgative, the illuminative, and the unitive life. In the first, man is
cleansed from sin and habitual imperfection by the use of the sacraments and by
voluntary mortification of the passions. The mind is purified by sedulous
meditation on the last end and on the Life and Passion of Christ, which must
ever be the great model of the Christian. This first portion of the way to
heaven can be covered by the help of the ordinary means of grace, without any
direct and extraordinary intervention of divine power. <pb n="26" id="iii-Page_26"/>The
second part differs in many ways from the first. It comprises the passive
purification of the soul and the passive enlightenment of the mind. By sending
it keen interior and exterior trials and sufferings, God completes the
cleansing of the soul in a manner far surpassing any voluntary effort of man.
By raising it to the stage of contemplation He gives it fresh light on the
mysteries of our Redemption. The mind is then no longer compelled to strain the
memory, the reason, and the will, in order to dwell upon the great truths of
religion and to derive some personal benefit therefrom, for these truths are
now more or less permanently before it and fill it with holy thoughts,
sometimes giving it consolation in trouble, at other times striking a warning
note against imperfection. Again, the subtraction of sensible consolation, and
the interior aridity arising therefrom, leave a terrible blank in the soul,
showing it that, without God&#8217;s help, it is mere nothingness. This apparent
estrangement from God is the keenest trial that can befall a soul, but also the
most powerful means of cleansing it from the least, the most subtle
imperfections.</p>

<p id="iii-p30">Emerging
from this state of probation, the soul enters upon the third stage, in which,
though perhaps in the midst of severe suffering and sharp persecution, it knows
itself to be a chosen child of God, to Whom it is united by perfect conformity
of the will. Such phenomena as revelations, visions, <pb n="27" id="iii-Page_27"/>locutions,
and even more wonderful manifestations, like the wound of love, spiritual
betrothal and nuptials, are incidental rather than essential to the second and
third stages. Some great contemplatives have never experienced anything of the
kind, while, on the other hand, some of these occurrences may sometimes have
been merely the work of an exuberant imagination, or even the result of
diabolical illusion. They should therefore never be wished for, or cherished,
but rather shunned and ignored, in as far as that is possible. If they are real
and come from God, they will do their work without the co-operation of the
soul. The danger of self-deception is so great that a person labouring under
such phenomena should offer every resistance, and the spiritual director should
exercise the utmost vigilance. St. Teresa is very eloquent on this point, and
undeceived many would-be contemplatives, while her disciple, St. John of the
Cross, is even more thorough-going in the deprecation of spiritual favours.
Among the numerous marks whereby the trained theologian may discriminate
between real and imaginary phenomena, there is one about which Saint Teresa
speaks with wonderful clearness. If they proceed from hysteria the imagination
alone is active and the higher powers of the soul are torpid; if, however, they
come from God, the intellect and the will are so intensely active, <pb n="28" id="iii-Page_28"/>that
the lower powers and even the body lose all strength for the time being.</p>

<p id="iii-p31">It
will be noticed that the first two Mansions belong to the purgative life, the
third and fourth to the illuminative, and the remaining three to the unitive
life. Compared with similar works, the treatment of the first stage must be
called meagre. True, in her <i>Life</i> and
in the <i>Way of Perfection</i> St. Teresa
has dealt with this subject somewhat more fully. Indeed, the last-named work
was designed as a treatise on Christian Ascetics, dealing with the purgation of
the soul by mortification and the enlightenment of the mind by meditation. There,
too, appears the first idea of the <i>Mansions</i>,<note n="25" id="iii-p31.1"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xx. 1</note>&#160; and Fuente remarks that the passage in
question may be taken for the parting of the ways between the two works.
However, this is not the only, nor, indeed, the chief reason why St. Teresa is
so reticent about the preliminary stage of the contemplative life. The fact is
that she herself did not pass through these experiences. By God&#8217;s grace she was
preserved from childhood from grievous sin and gross imperfection. Though she
never grows tired of bewailing her faults and unfaithfulness, these avowals
must be taken <i>cum grano salis</i>. While
yet a child, she sometimes gave way to vanity in dress and wasted her time in
reading romances. As a young religious, she was sought after by friends and
relatives who <pb n="29" id="iii-Page_29"/>took
pleasure in her attractive conversation. This proved further loss of time and
caused distractions. Owing to acute suffering, she for some years left off the
practice of mental prayer, though she faithfully performed all her religious
obligations, as far as her weak state of health allowed. This is all. The war
of the flesh against the spirit, the insubordination of the lower parts of
nature, the fickleness of the will, which so often thwart the most noble
aspirations of a soul, were unknown to her. Under these circumstances, we
cannot be surprised to find her entering upon the journey towards God at a
point which in many cases marks but the closing stage.</p>

<p id="iii-p32">As
to the remaining parts of this book, it will be seen from the parallel passages
that they cover much the same ground as her <i>Life</i>
and the <i>Relations</i>. With her singular
gift of introspection and analysis, the Saint studied her own case from every
point of view, so as to make sure that her extraordinary experiences were due
to no illusion, and offered no obstacle to the safety of her soul. Although the
<i>Interior Castle</i> contains little that
we do not already know from her other works, it is superior to them by reason
of its logical order and the masterly treatment of the most recondite matters
of mystical theology. While ostensibly dealing with general facts, St. Teresa
in reality records her personal experiences. How definite these were, how
little room there remained for the freaks of the imagination, <pb n="30" id="iii-Page_30"/>will
appear from the fact that she nearly always repeats the very words she had used
in her <i>Life</i> and in the other reports
of her interior progress, although she did not have these writings before her
eyes, nor had she ever seen them since they first left her hands. Every one of
her experiences must have produced a profound impression to be remembered so
minutely after an interval of years.</p>

<p id="iii-p33">There
is that in the <i>Interior Castle</i> which
reminds one of Dante&#8217;s <i>Paradiso</i>. In
the one and the other, the soul, purified from earthly dross, is gradually
being invested with new and glorious qualities, and is being led through
regions unknown until it arrives at the very threshold of the throne of God.
Not even the boldest imagination could have designed so wonderful a picture of
a soul adorned with graces at once so varied and so true. In one case we know,
the poet has drawn abundantly from the treasury of the Angelical Doctor,
putting in verse the conclusions of the scholastic theologian. In the other
case we can follow, chapter by chapter, the influence of the teaching of St.
Thomas Aquinas. St. Teresa had never studied it herself, but her directors and
confessors were deeply versed in it and solved her doubts and perplexities on
the lines of the greatest of the school men. The <i>Interior Castle</i> might almost be considered a practical illustration
of certain parts of the <i>Summa theologica</i>,<note n="26" id="iii-p33.1">S. Theol.
2da 2d&#230;, qq. 171-184.</note>
 <pb n="31" id="iii-Page_31"/>as
it describes the progress of the soul through every stage of perfection. When
we have reached the second chapter of the seventh Mansion, there remains but
one thing: the Beatific Vision, and this is reserved for the next life.</p>

<p id="iii-p34">After
the publication of the <i>Interior Castle</i>
by Luis de Leon, the manuscript came into the possession of Father Jerome
Gracian, who, after having made a copy of it which is still extant, presented
the original, on the occasion of a visit to the convent of Seville, to Don
Pedro Cereso Pardo, a great friend of the Saint, and a benefactor to the
convent. When his only daughter took the habit there, the precious manuscript
was part of her dowry. Do&#241;a Juana de Mendoza, Duchess of Beguiar, a novice in
the same convent, had it bound in silver and precious stones. It is still
there,<note n="27" id="iii-p34.1">Bollandists,
<i>Acta</i>, n. 1495. See also Impressions
in Spain. By Lady Herbert. London, 1867, p, 171.</note>&#160; and the present writer had the privilege of
seeing it. It comprises a hundred and thirteen leaves in folio, but originally
there must have been some more leaves which at a later period were torn out.
These, it is presumed, contained the headings of the chapters. Unlike the <i>Life</i> and the <i>Foundations</i>, the text of the <i>Castle</i>
is divided only by figures, without indication of the contents of each chapter,
but the arguments which have come down to us are so entirely similar to those
of the two works <pb n="32" id="iii-Page_32"/>named,
that it is impossible to consider them otherwise than the genuine work of the
author. In the present translation they have been inserted in their proper
places.</p>

<p id="iii-p35">On
the occasion of the ter-centenary of Saint Teresa&#8217;s death, a photo-lithographic
edition of the original was published under the direction of Cardinal Lluch,
Carmelite of the old observance, Archbishop of Seville:</p>

<verse id="iii-p35.1">

<l id="iii-p35.4"><i>Litografia de Juan Moyano</i> (Seville) 1882.</l>
</verse>

<p id="iii-p36">The
present translation, the third in English,<note n="28" id="iii-p36.1"><p id="iii-p37">The first translation is to
be found in the <i>Works of the Holy Mother
St. Teresa of Jesus</i> (third part). Printed in the year MDCLXXV, pp. 137-286.
It bears the title: <i>The Interiour Castle:
or, Mansions</i>. As to the authors of this translation&#8212;Abraham Woodhead and
another, whose name is not known&#8212;see my book <i>Carmel in England</i>, p. 342, note. It is stated there that the third
part, containing the <i>Way of Perfection</i>
and the <i>Castle</i>, has no title-page.
This is true with regard to the copy I had before me when writing that book.
The one I have now is more complete.</p>

<p id="iii-p38">The
second translation, by the Rev. John Dalton, appeared in 1852 and has been
repeatedly reprinted. It was dedicated to Bishop Ullathorne.</p>

<p id="iii-p39">Of
foreign translations it will be sufficient to mention the one by Cyprien de la
Nativit&#233;, in <i>&#338;uvres de la Sainte M&#232;re
T&#233;r&#232;se de J&#233;sus</i>, Paris, 1657, and the new one in
<i>&#338;uvres</i> already mentioned.</p></note>&#160; has
been made directly from this autograph edition. It has been thought advisable
that, as far as the genius of the language allows it, the wording of the author
should be strictly adhered to, and that not even a shade of her expression
should be sacrificed. For Teresa is not only a saint whose <pb n="33" id="iii-Page_33"/>every
word is telling, but she is a classic in her own language who knows how to give
expression to her deepest thoughts. Having compared word for word the
translation with the original, I am in a position to affirm that this programme
has been faithfully carried out. For the foot-notes&#8212;with few exceptions&#8212;as
well as for the Index, I am responsible. It seemed to me important to point out
all the parallel passages from the various works of the Saint. Only by this
means can it be seen how consistent Saint Teresa is in all her
writings.<note n="29" id="iii-p39.1"><p id="iii-p40">The present
translation ought to dispose of the reservations expressed by an able critic in
his otherwise valuable appreciation of the works of the Saint. See <i>Santa Teresa</i>, by the late Alexander
Whyte, D.D. London, 1898, p. 32.</p>

<p id="iii-p41">Criticisms
which have appeared in various papers, or have been privately conveyed, have
been gratefully received and acted upon in the second and the present
edition.</p></note>&#160; It would have been easy to multiply
quotations from the works of other writers on mystical theology. Thus, the
influence of the <i>Imitation of Christ</i>
and of the <i>Life of our Lord</i> by
Ludolphus the Carthusian can be distinctly traced in the <i>Interior Castle</i>. Both these works, as well as some Spanish books,
were held in such esteem by St. Teresa, that she ordered the prioress of each
convent to keep them at the disposal of the nuns. As there is a limit to
footnotes, I have contented myself with such references as seemed to me
conducive to the elucidation of the doctrine laid down in this treatise.</p>

<p id="iii-p42">In
conclusion I venture to express the hope that <pb n="34" id="iii-Page_34"/>this
new translation will be found helpful by those who feel called to a higher
life.</p>

<h2 id="iv-p0.1">THE INTERIOR CASTLE</h2>

<h2 id="iv-p0.2">OR THE MANSIONS</h2>

<h2 id="iv-p0.3">BY ST. TERESA</h2>

<h2 id="iv-p0.4">IHS</h2>


<p class="Centered" id="iv-p1">THIS
TREATISE, STYLED THE INTERIOR CASTLE, WAS WRITTEN BY TERESA OF JESUS, NUN OF
OUR LADY OF CARMEL, FOR HER SISTERS AND DAUGHTERS, THE DISCALCED CARMELITE
NUNS.</p>

<p class="First" id="iv-p2">RARELY
has obedience laid upon me so difficult a task as this of writing about prayer;
for one reason, because I do not feel that God has given me either the power or
the desire for it, besides which, during the last three months I have suffered
from noises and a great weakness in my head that have made it painful for me to
write even on necessary business.<note n="30" id="iv-p2.1">&#8217;I
am always suffering from my head.&#8217; Letter of June 28, 1577. <i>Letters</i>. VOL. II.</note></p>

<p id="iv-p3">However,
as I know the power obedience has of making things easy which seem impossible,
my will submits with a good grace, although nature seems greatly distressed,
for God has not given me such strength as to bear, without repugnance, the
constant struggle against illness while performing many different duties. May He,
Who has helped <pb n="36" id="iv-Page_36"/>me
in other more difficult matters, aid me with His grace in this, for I trust in
His mercy. I think I have but little to say that has not already been put forth
in my other works written under obedience; in fact, I fear this will be but
repetition of them. I am like a parrot which has learnt to talk; only knowing
what it has been taught or has heard, it repeats the same thing over and over
again. If God wishes me to write anything new, He will teach it me, or bring
back to my memory what I have said elsewhere. I should be content even with
this, for as I am very forgetful, I should be glad to be able to recall some of
the matters about which people say I have spoken well, lest they should be
altogether lost. If our Lord will not even grant me this, still, if I weary my
brains and increase my headache by striving to obey, I shall gain in merit,
though my words should be useless to any one. So I begin this work on the Feast
of the Blessed Trinity in the year 1577, in the Convent of St. Joseph of Carmel
at Toledo, where I am living, and I submit all my writings to the judgment of
those learned men by whose commands I undertake them. That it will be the fault
of ignorance, not malice, if I say anything contrary to the doctrine of the
Holy Roman Catholic Church, may be held as certain. By God&#8217;s goodness I am, and
always shall be, faithful to the Church, as I have been in the past. May He be
for ever blessed and glorified. Amen.</p>

<p id="iv-p4">He
who bids me write this, tells me that the nuns of these convents of our Lady of
Carmel need some one to solve their difficulties about prayer: he <pb n="37" id="iv-Page_37"/>thinks
that women understand one another&#8217;s language best and that my sisters&#8217;
affection for me would make them pay special attention to my words, therefore
it is important for me to explain the subject clearly to them. Thus I am
writing only to my sisters; the idea that any one else could benefit by what I
say would be absurd. Our Lord will be doing me a great favour if He enables me
to help but one of the nuns to praise Him a little better; His Majesty knows
well that I have no other aim. If anything is to the point, they will
understand that it does not originate from me and there is no reason to
attribute it to me, as with my scant understanding and skill I could write nothing
of the sort, unless God, in His mercy, enabled me to do so.</p>

WHILE I was begging our Lord to-day to speak for me, since I knew not what to

occurred to me which I will explain, and which will serve as a foundation for
that I am about to write.</p>

uses the same comparison: &#8216;If the soul shall overcome the devil in the first
combat, it shall then pass on to the second; and if it shall be victorious
there also, it shall then pass on to the third; and then through the seven
mansions, the seven degrees of love, until the Bridegroom shall bring it to the
&#8220;cellar of wine&#8221; of perfect charity.&#8217; (<i>Ascent of Mount Carmel</i>, bk. ii. ch. xi. 7.)</note>&#160; If we reflect, sisters, we shall see that the
soul of the just man is but a paradise, in which, God tells us, He takes His
delight.<note n="34" id="v.i-p4.5"><scripRef passage="Prov. viii. 31" id="v.i-p4.6" parsed="|Prov|8|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.8.31">Prov.

in which a King so mighty, so wise, and so pure, containing in Himself all
good, can delight to rest? Nothing can be compared to the great beauty and
capabilities of a soul; however keen our intellects may be, they are as unable
to comprehend them as to comprehend God, for, as He has told us, He created us
in His own image and likeness.<note n="35" id="v.i-p4.7"><scripRef passage="Gen. i. 26" id="v.i-p4.8" parsed="|Gen|1|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.26">Gen.

<p id="v.i-p5">3.
As this is so, we need not tire ourselves by trying to realize all the beauty
of this castle, although, being His creature, there is all the difference
between the soul and God that there is between the creature and the Creator;
the fact that it is made in God&#8217;s image teaches us how great are its dignity
and loveliness. It is no small misfortune and disgrace that, through our own
fault, we neither understand our nature nor our origin. Would it not be gross
ignorance, my daughters, if, when a man was questioned about his name, or
country, or parents, he could not answer? Stupid as this would be, it is
unspeakably more foolish to care to learn <pb n="40" id="v.i-Page_40"/>nothing
of our nature except that we possess bodies, and only to realize vaguely that
we have souls, because people say so and it is a doctrine of faith. Rarely do
we reflect upon what gifts our souls may possess, Who dwells within them, or
how extremely precious they are. Therefore we do little to preserve their
beauty; all our care is concentrated on our bodies, which are but the coarse
setting of the diamond, or the outer walls of the castle.<note n="36" id="v.i-p5.1"><i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. xxviii.</note></p>

<p id="v.i-p6">4.
Let us imagine, as I said, that there are many rooms in this castle, of which
some are above, some below, others at the side; in the centre, in the very
midst of them all, is the principal chamber in which God and the soul hold
their most secret intercourse.<note n="37" id="v.i-p6.1">St.
John of the Cross on the words of his stanza: &#8216;In the inner cellar of my
Beloved have I drunk.&#8217; &#8216;Here the soul speaks of that sovereign grace of God in
taking it into the house of His love, which is the union or transformation of
love in God . . . The cellar is the highest degree of love to which the soul
can attain in this life, and is therefore said to be the inner. It follows from
this that there are other cellars not so interior; that is, the degrees of love
by which souls reach to this, the last. These cellars are seven in number, and
the soul has entered them all when it has in perfection the seven gifts of the
Holy Ghost, so far as it is possible for it. . . . Many souls reach and enter
the first cellar, each according to the perfection of its love, but the last
and inmost cellar is entered by few in this world, because therein is wrought
the perfect union with God, the union of the spiritual marriage.&#8217; <i>A Spiritual Canticle</i>, stanza xxvi. 1-3.
Concept. ch. vi. (<i>Minor Works of St.
Teresa</i>.)</note>&#160; Think over this comparison very carefully;
God grant it may enlighten you about the different kinds of graces He is pleased
to bestow upon the soul. No one can know all about them, much less a person so
ignorant as I am. The knowledge that such things are possible will console you
greatly should our Lord ever grant you
<pb n="41" id="v.i-Page_41"/>any
of these favours; people themselves deprived of them can then at least praise
Him for His great goodness in bestowing them on others. The thought of heaven
and the happiness of the saints does us no harm, but cheers and urges us to win
this joy for ourselves, nor will it injure us to know that during this exile
God can communicate Himself to us loathsome worms; it will rather make us love
Him for such immense goodness and infinite mercy.</p>

<p id="v.i-p7">5.
I feel sure that vexation at thinking that during our life on earth God can
bestow these graces on the souls of others shows a want of humility and charity
for one&#8217;s neighbour, for why should we not feel glad at a brother&#8217;s receiving
divine favours which do not deprive us of our own share? Should we not rather
rejoice at His Majesty&#8217;s thus manifesting His greatness wherever He chooses?<note n="38" id="v.i-p7.1">St. <scripRef passage="Matt. xx. 15" id="v.i-p7.2" parsed="|Matt|20|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.20.15">Matt.
xx. 15</scripRef>: &#8216;Alit non licet mihi quod volo, facere? an oculus tuus nequam est, quia
ego bonus sum?&#8217;</note>&#160; Sometimes our Lord acts thus solely for the
sake of showing His power, as He declared when the Apostles questioned whether
the blind man whom He cured had been suffering for his own or his parents&#8217;
sins.<note n="39" id="v.i-p7.3">St.
<scripRef passage="John ix. 2" id="v.i-p7.4" parsed="|John|9|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.9.2">John ix. 2</scripRef>: &#8216;Quis peccavit, hic, aut parentes ejus, ut c&#230;cus nasceretur?&#8217;</note>&#160; God does not bestow these favours on certain
souls because they are more holy than others who do not receive them, but to
manifest His greatness, as in the case of St. Paul and St. Mary Magdalen, and
that we may glorify Him in His creatures.</p>

<p id="v.i-p8">6.
People may say such things appear impossible and it is best not to scandalize
the weak in faith by <pb n="42" id="v.i-Page_42"/>speaking
about them. But it is better that the latter should disbelieve us, than that we
should desist from enlightening souls which receive these graces, that they may
rejoice and may endeavour to love God better for His favours, seeing He is so
mighty and so great. There is no danger here of shocking those for whom I write
by treating of such matters, for they know and believe that God gives even
greater proofs of His love. I am certain that if any one of you doubts the
truth of this, God will never allow her to learn it by experience, for He
desires that no limits should be set to His work: therefore, never discredit
them because you are not thus led yourselves.</p>

<p id="v.i-p9">7.
Now let us return to our beautiful and charming castle and discover how to enter
it. This appears incongruous: if this castle is the soul, clearly no one can
have to enter it, for it is the person himself: one might as well tell some one
to go into a room he is already in! There are, however, very different ways of
being in this castle; many souls live in the courtyard of the building where
the sentinels stand, neither caring to enter farther, nor to know who dwells in
that most delightful place, what is in it and what rooms it contains.</p>

<p id="v.i-p10">8.
Certain books on prayer that you have read advise the soul to enter into
itself,<note n="40" id="v.i-p10.1"><i>Imitation</i>, bk. II. ch. 1: &#8216;Regnum Dei intra vos 
est.&#8217; <scripRef passage="Luke. xvii. 21" id="v.i-p10.2" parsed="|Luke|17|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.17.21">Luke. xvii.  21</scripRef>. The <i>Imitation</i> is one of
the books which according to St. Teresa&#8217;s <i>Constitutions</i>,
(&#167; 7) every prioress was bound to provide for her convent.</note>&#160; and this is what I mean. I was recently told
by a great theologian that souls without prayer are like bodies, palsied and
lame, having hands and feet they cannot use.&#160;<pb n="43" id="v.i-Page_43"/> Just so,
there are souls so infirm and accustomed to think of nothing but earthly
matters, that there seems no cure for them. It appears impossible for them to
retire into their own hearts; accustomed as they are to be with the reptiles
and other creatures which live outside the castle, they have come at last to
imitate their habits. Though these souls are by their nature so richly endowed,
capable of communion even with God Himself, yet their case seems hopeless.
Unless they endeavour to understand and remedy their most miserable plight,
their minds will become, as it were, bereft of movement, just as Lot&#8217;s wife
became a pillar of salt for looking backwards in disobedience to God&#8217;s command.<note n="41" id="v.i-p10.3"><scripRef passage="Gen. xix. 26" id="v.i-p10.4" parsed="|Gen|19|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.19.26">Gen. xix.
26</scripRef>: &#8216;Respiciensque uxor ejus post se, versa est in statuam salis.&#8217;</note></p>

<p id="v.i-p11">9.
As far as I can understand, the gate by which to enter this castle is prayer
and meditation. I do not allude more to mental than to vocal prayer, for if it
is prayer at all, the mind must take part in it. If a person neither considers
to Whom he is addressing himself, what he asks, nor what he is who ventures to
speak to God, although his lips may utter many words, I do not call it prayer.<note n="42" id="v.i-p11.1"><i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. xxi. 6; xxix. 4.</note>&#160; Sometimes, indeed, one may pray devoutly
without making all these considerations through having practised them at other
times. The custom of speaking to God Almighty as freely as with a slave&#8212;caring
nothing whether the words are suitable or not, but simply saying the first
thing that comes to mind from being learnt by rote by frequent
repetition&#8212;cannot be called prayer: God grant that <pb n="44" id="v.i-Page_44"/>no
Christian may address Him in this manner. I trust His Majesty will prevent any
of you, sisters, from doing so. Our habit in this Order of conversing about
spiritual matters is a good preservative against such evil ways.</p>

<p id="v.i-p12">10.
Let us speak no more of these crippled souls, who are in a most miserable and
dangerous state, unless our Lord bid them rise, as He did the palsied man who
had waited more than thirty years at the pool of Bethsaida.<note n="43" id="v.i-p12.1">St. <scripRef passage="John v. 5" id="v.i-p12.2" parsed="|John|5|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.5">John v. 5</scripRef>: &#8216;Erat autem
quidam homo ibi triginta et octo annos habens in infirmitate sua.&#8217;</note>&#160; We will now think of the others who at last
enter the precincts of the castle; they are still very worldly, yet have some
desire to do right, and at times, though rarely, commend themselves to God&#8217;s
care. They think about their souls every now and then; although very busy, they
pray a few times a month, with minds generally filled with a thousand other
matters, for where their treasure is, there is their heart also.<note n="44" id="v.i-p12.3">St. <scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 21" id="v.i-p12.4" parsed="|Matt|6|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.21">Matt.
vi. 21</scripRef>: &#8216;Ubi enim est thesaurus tuus ibi est et cor tuum.</note>&#160; Still, occasionally they cast aside these
cares; it is a great boon for them to realize to some extent the state of their
souls, and to see that they will never reach the gate by the road they are
following.</p>

<p id="v.i-p13">11.
At length they enter the first rooms in the basement of the castle, accompanied
by numerous reptiles<note n="45" id="v.i-p13.1">Many
an ancient castle was provided with a bear-garden where rare animals were kept
for the amusement of the inhabitants. This may have supplied the material for
St. Teresa&#8217;s comparison.</note>&#160; which disturb their peace, and prevent their
seeing the beauty of the building; still, it is a great gain that these persons
should have found their way in at all.</p>

<p id="v.i-p14"> <pb n="45" id="v.i-Page_45"/>12.
You may think, my daughters, that all this does not concern you, because, by
God&#8217;s grace, you are farther advanced; still, you must be patient with me, for
I can explain myself on some spiritual matters concerning prayer in no other
way. May our Lord enable me to speak to the point; the subject is most
difficult to understand without personal experience of such graces. Any one who
has received them will know how impossible it is to avoid touching on subjects
which, by the mercy of God, will never apply to us.</p>

<p id="v.ii-p3">1.
BEFORE going farther, I wish you to consider the state to which mortal sin<note n="46" id="v.ii-p3.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxxviii. 31; ch. xl. 15.</note>&#160; brings this magnificent and beautiful castle,
this pearl of the East, this tree of life, planted beside the living waters of
life<note n="47" id="v.ii-p3.2"><scripRef passage="Ps. i. 3" id="v.ii-p3.3" parsed="|Ps|1|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.1.3">Ps.
i. 3</scripRef>: &#8216;Et erit tamquam lignum quod plantatum eat secus decursus 
aquarum.&#8217;</note> <pb n="46" id="v.ii-Page_46"/>which
symbolize God Himself. No night can be so dark, no gloom nor blackness can
compare to its obscurity. Suffice it to say that the sun in the centre of the
soul, which gave it such splendour and beauty, is totally eclipsed, though the
spirit is as fitted to enjoy God&#8217;s presence as is the crystal to reflect the
sun.<note n="48" id="v.ii-p3.4"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xxviii. 9.</note></p>

<p id="v.ii-p4">2.
While the soul is in mortal sin nothing can profit it; none of its good works
merit an eternal reward, since they do not proceed from God as their first
principle, and by Him alone is our virtue real virtue. The soul separated from
Him is no longer pleasing in His eyes, because by committing a mortal sin,
instead of seeking to please God, it prefers to gratify the devil, the prince
of darkness, and so comes to share his blackness. I knew a person to whom our
Lord revealed the result of a mortal sin<note n="49" id="v.ii-p4.1">In this as in most other cases when the Saint
speaks of &#8216;a person she knows,&#8217; she means herself. <i>Life</i>, ch. xl, 15.</note>&#160; and who said she thought no one who realized
its effects could ever commit it, but would suffer unimaginable torments to
avoid it. This vision made her very desirous for all to grasp this truth,
therefore I beg you, my daughters, to pray fervently to God for sinners, who
live in blindness and do deeds of darkness.</p>

<p id="v.ii-p5">3.
In a state of grace the soul is like a well of limpid water, from which flow
only streams of clearest crystal. Its works are pleasing both to God and man,
rising from the River of Life, beside which it is rooted like a tree. Otherwise
it would produce neither leaves nor fruit, for the waters of grace <pb n="47" id="v.ii-Page_47"/>nourish
it, keep it from withering from drought, and cause it to bring forth good
fruit. But the soul by sinning withdraws from this stream of life, and growing
beside a black and fetid pool, can produce nothing but disgusting and
unwholesome fruit.</p>

<p id="v.ii-p6">Notice
that it is not the fountain and the brilliant sun which lose their splendour
and beauty, for they are placed in the very centre of the soul and cannot be
deprived of their lustre. The soul is like a crystal in the sunshine over which
a thick black cloth has been thrown, so that however brightly the sun may shine
the crystal can never reflect it.</p>

<p id="v.ii-p7">4.
O souls, redeemed by the Blood of Jesus Christ, take these things to heart;
have mercy on yourselves! If you realize your pitiable condition, how can you
refrain from trying to remove the darkness from the crystal of your souls?
Remember, if death should take you now, you would never again enjoy the light
of this Sun. O Jesus! how sad a sight must be a soul deprived of light! What a
terrible state the chambers of this castle are in! How disorderly must be the
senses&#8212;the inhabitants of the castle&#8212;the powers of the soul its magistrates,
governors, and stewards&#8212;blind and uncontrolled as they are! In short, as the
soil in which the tree is now planted is in the devil&#8217;s domain, how can its
fruit be anything but evil? A man of great spiritual insight once told me he
was not so much surprised at such a soul&#8217;s wicked deeds as astonished that it
did not commit even worse sins. May God in His mercy keep us from such great
evil, for nothing in this life merits the name of evil in comparison with <pb n="48" id="v.ii-Page_48"/>this,
which delivers us over to evil which is eternal.</p>

<p id="v.ii-p8">5.
This is what we must dread and pray God to deliver us from, for we are weakness
itself, and unless He guards the city, in vain shall we labour to defend it.<note n="50" id="v.ii-p8.1">cxxvi. 1:
&#8217;Nisi Dominus custodierit civitatem, frustra vigilat qui custodit eam.&#8217;</note>&#160; The person of whom I spoke<note n="51" id="v.ii-p8.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxxviii. 33; ch. xl. 15, 16.</note>&#160; said that she had learnt two things from the
vision granted her. The first was, a great fear of offending God; seeing how
terrible were the consequences, she constantly begged Him to preserve her from
falling into sin. Secondly, it was a mirror to teach her humility, for she saw
that nothing good in us springs from ourselves but comes from the waters of
grace near which the soul remains like a tree planted beside a river, and from
that Sun which gives life to our works. She realized this so vividly that on
seeing any good deed performed by herself or by other people she at once turned
to God as to its fountain head&#8212;without whose help she knew well we can do
nothing&#8212;and broke out into songs of praise to Him. Generally she forgot all
about herself and only thought of God when she did any meritorious action.</p>

<p id="v.ii-p9">6.
The time which has been spent in reading or writing on this subject will not
have been lost if it has taught us these two truths; for though learned, clever
men know them perfectly, women&#8217;s wits are dull and need help in every way.
Perhaps this is why our Lord has suggested these comparisons to me; may He give
us grace to profit by them!</p>

<p id="v.ii-p10">7.
So obscure are these spiritual matters that to <pb n="49" id="v.ii-Page_49"/>explain
them an ignorant person like myself must say much that is superfluous, and even
alien to the subject, before coming to the point. My readers must be patient
with me, as I am with myself while writing what I do not understand; indeed, I
often take up the paper like a dunce, not knowing what to say, nor how to
begin. Doubtless there is need for me to do my best to explain these spiritual
subjects to you, for we often hear how beneficial prayer is for our souls; our
Constitutions oblige us to pray so many hours a day, yet tell us nothing of
what part we ourselves can take in it and very little of the work God does in
the soul by its means.<note n="52" id="v.ii-p10.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. x. 2 <i>sqq</i>. <i>Constitut</i>. 2, 6.</note>&#160; It will be helpful, in setting it before you
in various ways, to consider this heavenly edifice within us, so little understood
by men, near as they often come to it. Our Lord gave me grace to understand
something of such matters when I wrote on them before, yet I think I have more
light now, especially on the more difficult questions. Unfortunately I am too
ignorant to treat of such subjects without saying much that is already well
known.</p>

<p id="v.ii-p11">8.
Now let us turn at last to our castle with its many mansions. You must not
think of a suite of rooms placed in succession, but fix your eyes on the keep,
the court inhabited by the King.<note n="53" id="v.ii-p11.1"><i>Way of Perf</i>.. ch. xxviii. 1.</note>&#160; Like the kernel of the palmito,<note n="54" id="v.ii-p11.2">The palmito
here referred to is not a palm, but a shrub about four feet high and very dense
with leaves, resembling palm leaves. The poorer classes and principally
children dig it up by the roots, which they peel of its many layers until a
sort of kernel is disclosed, which is eaten, not without relish, and is
somewhat like a filbert in taste. See St. John of the Cross, Accent of Mount
Carmel, bk. ii. ch, xiv, 3.</note>&#160; from which several rinds <pb n="50" id="v.ii-Page_50"/>must
be removed before coming to the eatable part, this principal chamber is
surrounded by many others. However large, magnificent, and spacious you imagine
this castle to be, you cannot exaggerate it; the capacity of the soul is beyond
all our understanding, and the Sun within this palace enlightens every part of
it.</p>

<p id="v.ii-p12">9.
A soul which gives itself to prayer, either much or little, should on no
account be kept within narrow bounds. Since God has given it such great
dignity, permit it to wander at will through the rooms of the castle, from the
lowest to the highest. Let it not force itself to remain for very long in the
same mansion, even that of self-knowledge. Mark well, however, that
self-knowledge is indispensable, even for those whom God takes to dwell in the
same mansion with Himself. Nothing else, however elevated, perfects the soul
which must never seek to forget its own nothingness. Let humility be always at
work, like the bee at the honeycomb, or all will be lost. But, remember, the
bee leaves its hive to fly in search of flowers and the soul should sometimes
cease thinking of itself to rise in meditation on the grandeur and majesty of
its God. It will learn its own baseness better thus than by self-contemplation,
and will be freer from the reptiles which enter the first room where
self-knowledge is acquired. Although it is a great grace from God to practise
self-examination, yet &#8216;too much is as bad as too little,&#8217; as they say; believe me, by God&#8217;s
help, we shall advance more by contemplating the <pb n="51" id="v.ii-Page_51"/> Divinity than by keeping our eyes
fixed on ourselves, poor creatures of earth that we are.</p>

<p id="v.ii-p13">10.
I do not know whether I have put this clearly; self-knowledge is of such
consequence that I would not have you careless of it, though you may be lifted
to heaven in prayer, because while on earth nothing is more needful than
humility. Therefore, I repeat, not only a <i>good</i>
way, but the <i>best</i> of all ways, is to
endeavour to enter first by the room where humility is practised, which is far
better than at once rushing on to the others. This is the right road;&#8212;if we
know how easy and safe it is to walk by it, why ask for wings with which to
fly? Let us rather try to learn how to advance quickly. I believe we shall
never learn to know ourselves except by endeavouring to know God, for,
beholding His greatness we are struck by our own baseness, His purity shows our
foulness, and by meditating on His humility we find how very far we are from
being humble.</p>

<p id="v.ii-p14">11.
Two advantages are gained by this practice. First, it is clear that white looks
far whiter when placed near something black, and on the contrary, black never
looks so dark as when seen beside something white. Secondly, our understanding
and will become more noble and capable of good in every way when we turn from
ourselves to God: it is very injurious never to raise our minds above the mire
of our own faults. I described how murky and fetid are the streams that spring
from the source of a soul in mortal sin.<note n="55" id="v.ii-p14.1"><i>Supra</i>,
&#167; 3.</note>&#160; Thus (although the case is <pb n="52" id="v.ii-Page_52"/>not
really the same, God forbid! this is only a comparison), while we are
continually absorbed in contemplating the weakness of our earthly nature, the
springs of our actions will never flow free from the mire of timid, weak, and
cowardly thoughts, such as: &#8216;I wonder whether people are noticing me or not! If
I follow this course, will harm come to me? Dare I begin this work? Would it
not be presumptuous? Is it right for any one as faulty as myself to speak on
sublime spiritual subjects?<note n="56" id="v.ii-p14.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. viii. 6, x. 4, xxiii. 3-5. <i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xxxix. 1.</note>&#160; Will not people think too well of me, if I
make myself singular? Extremes are bad, even in virtue; sinful as I am I shall
only fall the lower. Perhaps I shall fail and be a source of scandal to good
people; such a person as I am has no need of peculiarities.&#8217;</p>

<p id="v.ii-p15">12.
Alas, my daughters, what loss the devil must have caused to many a soul by such
thoughts as these! It thinks such ideas and many others of the same sort I
could mention arise from humility. This comes from not understanding our own
nature; self-knowledge becomes so warped that, unless we take our thoughts off
ourselves, I am not surprised that these and many worse fears should threaten
us. Therefore I maintain, my daughters, that we should fix our eyes on Christ
our only good, and on His saints; there we shall learn true humility, and our
minds will be ennobled, so that self-knowledge will not make us base and
cowardly. Although only the first, this mansion contains great riches and such
treasures that if the soul only manages to <pb n="53" id="v.ii-Page_53"/>elude
the reptiles dwelling here, it cannot fail to advance farther. Terrible are the
wiles and stratagems the devil uses to hinder people from realizing their
weakness and detecting his snares.</p>

<p id="v.ii-p16">13.
From personal experience I could give you much information as to what happens
in these first mansions. I will only say that you must not imagine there are
only a few, but a number of rooms, for souls enter them by many different ways,
and always with a good intention. The devil is so angry at this that he keeps
legions of evil spirits hidden in each room to stop the progress of Christians,
whom, being ignorant of this, he entraps in a thousand ways. He cannot so
easily deceive souls which dwell nearer to the King as he can beginners still
absorbed in the world, immersed in its pleasures, and eager for its honours and
distinctions. As the vassals of their souls, the senses and powers bestowed on
them by God, are weak, such people are easily vanquished, although desirous not
to offend God.</p>

<p id="v.ii-p17">14.
Those conscious of being in this state must as often as possible have recourse
to His Majesty, taking His Blessed Mother and the saints for their advocates to
do battle for them, because we creatures possess little strength for
self-defence. Indeed in every state of life all our help must come from God;
may He in His mercy grant it us, Amen! What a miserable life we lead! As I have
spoken more fully in other writings<note n="57" id="v.ii-p17.1"><i>Life</i> ch. xiii. 23. <i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. x. 4. <i>Castle</i>,
M. iii. ch. ii. 8. <i>Concep</i>. ch. ii.
20. <i>Const</i>. 21.</note>&#160; on the ill that results from ignoring the
need of humility and self-knowledge, I will treat <pb n="54" id="v.ii-Page_54"/>no
more about it here, my daughters, although it is of the first importance. God
grant that what I have said may be useful to you.</p>

<p id="v.ii-p18">15
You must notice that the light which comes from the King&#8217;s palace hardly shines
at all in these first mansions; although not as gloomy and black as the soul in
mortal sin, yet they are in semi-darkness, and their inhabitants see scarcely
anything. I cannot explain myself; I do not mean that this is the fault of the
mansions themselves, but that the number of snakes, vipers, and venomous
reptiles from outside the castle prevent souls entering them from seeing the
light. They resemble a person entering a chamber full of brilliant sunshine,
with eyes clogged and half closed with dust. Though the room itself is light,
he cannot see because of his self-imposed impediment. In the same way, these
fierce and wild beasts blind the eyes of the beginner, so that he sees nothing
but them.</p>

<p id="v.ii-p19">16.
Such, it appears to me, is the soul which, though not in a state of mortal sin,
is so worldly and preoccupied with earthly riches, honours, and affairs, that
as I said, even if it sincerely wishes to enter into itself and enjoy the
beauties of the castle, it is prevented by these distractions and seems unable
to overcome so many obstacles. It is most important to withdraw from all
unnecessary cares and business, as far as compatible with the duties of one&#8217;s state
of life, in order to enter the second mansion. This is so essential, that
unless done immediately I think it impossible for any one ever to reach the
principal room, or even to remain <pb n="55" id="v.ii-Page_55"/>where
he is without great risk of losing what is already gained; otherwise, although
he is inside the castle, he will find it impossible to avoid being bitten some
time or other by some of the very venomous creatures surrounding him.</p>

<p id="v.ii-p20">17.
What then would become of a religious like ourselves, my daughters, if, after
having escaped from all these impediments, and having entered much farther into
the more secret mansion, she should, by her own fault, return to all this
turmoil? Through her sins, many other people on whom God had bestowed great
graces would culpably relapse into their wretched state. In our convents we are
free from these exterior evils; please God our minds may be as free from them,
and may He deliver us from such ills.</p>

<p id="v.ii-p21">18.
Do not trouble yourselves, my daughters, with cares which do not concern you.
You must notice that the struggle with the demons continues through nearly all
the mansions of this castle. True, in some of them, the guards, which, as I
explained, are the powers of the soul, have strength for the combat, but we
must be keenly on the watch against the devils&#8217;s arts, lest he deceive us in
the form of an angel of light. He creeps in gradually, in numberless ways, and
does us much harm, though we do not discover it until too late.<note n="58" id="v.ii-p21.1"><i>Life</i> ch. xxxi. 23.</note>
</p>

<p id="v.ii-p22">19.
As I said elsewhere,<note n="59" id="v.ii-p22.1">No
doubt the Saint often used this excellent comparison in her verbal
instructions, but it occurs nowhere else in her writings.</note>&#160; he works like a file, secretly and silently
wearing its way: I will give you some examples to show how he begins his wiles.<pb n="56" id="v.ii-Page_56"/> For instance: a
nun has such a longing for penance as to feel no peace unless she is tormenting
herself in some way.<note n="60" id="v.ii-p22.2"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. x. 5; xxxix. 4; <i>Rel</i>. iii. 12.</note>&#160; This is good in itself; but suppose that the
Prioress has forbidden her to practise any mortifications without special
leave, and the sister thinking that, in such a meritorious cause, she may
venture to disobey, secretly leads such a life that she loses her health and
cannot even fulfil the requirements of her rule&#8212;you see how this show of good
ends. Another nun is very zealous about religious perfection; this is very
right, but may cause her to think every small fault she sees in her sisters a
serious crime, and to watch constantly whether they do anything wrong, that she
may run to the Prioress to accuse them of it. At the same time, may be she
never notices her own shortcomings because of her great zeal about other
people&#8217;s religious observance, while perhaps her sisters, not seeing her
intention but only knowing of the watch she keeps on them, do not take her
behaviour in good part.</p>

<p id="v.ii-p23">20.
The devil&#8217;s chief aim here is to cool the charity and lessen the mutual
affection of the nuns, which would injure them seriously. Be sure, my
daughters, that true perfection consists in the love of God and our neighbour,
and the better we keep both these commandments, the more perfect we shall be.
The sole object of our Rule and Constitutions is to help us to observe these
two laws.</p>

<p id="v.ii-p24">21.
Indiscreet zeal about others must not be indulged in; it may do us much harm;
let each one look to herself. However, as I have spoken fully <pb n="57" id="v.ii-Page_57"/>on
this subject elsewhere,<note n="61" id="v.ii-p24.1">The
Saint must frequently have spoken on the subject, but she never treated it more
fully than in this place. <i>Way of Perf.</i>
ch. xii. 7. <i>Life</i>, ch. xiii. 11, 14 <i>sqq</i>. Visitation of convents.</note>&#160; I will not enlarge on it here, and will only
beg you to remember the necessity of this mutual affection. Our souls may lose
their peace and even disturb other people&#8217;s if we are always criticizing trivial
actions which often are not real defects at all, but we construe them wrongly
through ignorance of their motives. See how much it costs to attain perfection!
Sometimes the devil tempts nuns in this way about the Prioress, which is still
more dangerous. Great prudence is then required, for if she disobeys the Rule
or Constitutions the matter must not always be overlooked, but should be
mentioned to her;<note n="62" id="v.ii-p24.2"><i>Way of Perfection</i>, ch. ii. 3. Visit.
20-22, 34, 36.</note>&#160; if, after this, she does not amend, the
Superior of the Order should be informed of it. It is true charity to speak in
this case, as it would be if we saw our sisters commit a grave fault; to keep
silence for fear that speech would be a temptation against charity, would be
that very temptation itself.<note n="63" id="v.ii-p24.3">&#8217;It
is terrible to think what harm a Prioress can do! For although the Sisters
witness things which scandalize them (of which there are plenty here!), yet
they think it would be sinning against obedience to see any harm in them.&#8217;
(Letter to Father Gracian, written at Malagon at the beginning of December,
5579. <i>Letters</i>, Vol. III.)</note></p>

<p id="v.ii-p25">22.
However, I must warn you seriously not to talk to each other about such things,
lest the devil deceive you. He would gain greatly by your doing so, because it
would lead to the habit of detraction; rather, as I said, state the matter to
those whose duty it is to remedy it. Thank God our custom <pb n="58" id="v.ii-Page_58"/>here
of keeping almost perpetual silence gives little opportunity for such
conversations, still, it is well to stand ever on our guard.</p>

OF THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF PERSEVERANCE IN ORDER TO ENTER THE LAST MANSIONS,
AND OF THE FIERCE WAR THE DEVIL WAGES AGAINST US. HOW ESSENTIAL IT IS TO TAKE
THE RIGHT PATH FROM THE VERY COMMENCEMENT OF OUR JOURNEY. A METHOD OF ACTION
WHICH HAS PROVED VERY EFFICACIOUS.</p>

<p id="vi.i-p3">1.
Now let us consider which are the souls that enter the second mansions, and
what they do there: I do not wish to enlarge on this subject, having already
treated it very fully elsewhere,<note n="64" id="vi.i-p3.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xi-xiii. <i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xx.-xxix.</note>&#160; for
I could not avoid repeating myself, as my memory is very bad. If I could state
my ideas in another form they would not weary you, for we never tire of reading
books on this subject, numerous as they are. <pb n="60" id="vi.i-Page_60"/>2.
In this part of the castle are found souls which have begun to practise
prayer; they realize the importance of their not remaining in the first
mansions, yet often lack determination to quit their present condition by
avoiding occasions of sin, which is a very perilous state to be in.</p>

<p id="vi.i-p4">3.
However, it is a great grace that they should sometimes make good their escape
from the vipers and poisonous creatures around them and should understand the
need of avoiding them. In some way these souls suffer a great deal more than
those in the first mansions, although not in such danger, as they begin to
understand their peril and there are great hopes of their entering farther into
the castle. I say that they suffer a great deal more, for those in an earlier
stage are like deaf-mutes and are not so distressed at being unable to speak,
while the others, who can hear but cannot talk, find it much harder. At the
same time, it is better not to be deaf, and a decided advantage to hear what is
said to us.</p>

<p id="vi.i-p5">4.
These souls hear our Lord calling them, for as they approach nearer to where
His Majesty dwells He proves a loving Neighbour, though they may still be
engaged in the amusements and business, the pleasures and vanities of this
world. While in this state we continually fall into sin and rise again, for the
creatures amongst whom we dwell are so venomous, so vicious, and so dangerous,
that it is almost impossible to avoid being tripped up by them. Yet such are
the pity and compassion of this Lord of ours, so desirous is He that we should <pb n="61" id="vi.i-Page_61"/>seek
Him and enjoy His company, that in one way or another He never ceases calling
us to Him. So sweet is His voice, that the poor soul is disconsolate at being
unable to follow His bidding at once, and therefore, as I said, suffers more
than if it could not hear Him.</p>

<p id="vi.i-p6">5.
I do not mean that divine communications and inspirations received in this
mansion are the same as those I shall describe later on; God here speaks to
souls through words uttered by pious people, by sermons or good books, and in
many other such ways. Sometimes He calls souls by means of sickness or
troubles, or by some truth He teaches them during prayer, for tepid as they may
be in seeking Him, yet God holds them very dear.</p>

<p id="vi.i-p7">6.
Do not think lightly, sisters, of this first grace, nor be downcast if you have
not responded immediately to Our Lord&#8217;s voice, for His Majesty is willing to
wait for us many a day and even many a year, especially when He sees
perseverance and good desires in our hearts. Perseverance is the first
essential; with this we are sure to profit greatly. However, the devils now fiercely
assault the soul in a thousand different ways: it suffers more than ever,
because formerly it was mute and deaf, or at least could hear very little, and
offered but feeble resistance, like one who has almost lost all hope of
victory.</p>

<p id="vi.i-p8">7.
Here, however, the understanding being more vigilant and the powers more on the
alert, we cannot avoid hearing the fighting and cannonading around us. For now
the devils set on us the reptiles, that is to say, thoughts about the world and
its joys <pb n="62" id="vi.i-Page_62"/>which
they picture as unending; they remind us of the high esteem men held us in, of
our friends and relations; they tell us how the penances which souls in this
mansion always begin to wish to perform would injure our health: in fine, the
evil spirits place a thousand impediments in the way.</p>

<p id="vi.i-p9">8.
O Jesus! What turmoil the devils cause in the poor soul! How unhappy it feels,
not knowing whether to go forward or to return to the first mansion! On the
other hand, reason shows it the delusion of overrating worldly things, while
faith teaches what alone can satisfy its cravings. Memory reminds the soul how
all earthly joys end, recalling the death of those who lived at ease; how some
died suddenly and were soon forgotten, how others, once so prosperous, are now
buried beneath the ground and men pass by the graves where they lie, the prey
of worms,<note n="65" id="vi.i-p9.1">&#8217;How
many, thinking to live long, have been deceived and unexpectedly have been
snatched away! How often hast thou heard that such a one was slain by the
sword; another drowned; another, falling from on high, broke his neck; this man
died at the table; that other came to his death while he was at play. . . .
Thus death is the end of all; and man&#8217;s life passeth suddenly like a shadow&#8217; (<i>Imitation</i>, bk. 1. ch. xxiii. 7). The
edition of the <i>Imitation</i> known to St.
Teresa under the title of <i>Contemptus
Mundi</i> was translated by Luis de Granada, printed at Seville in 1536, at
Lisbon in 1542, and at Alcal&#225; in 1548. See <i>Life</i>,
ch. xxxix. 21, note.</note>&#160; while the mind recalls many other such
incidents.</p>

<p id="vi.i-p10">9.
The will inclines to love Our Lord and longs to make some return to Him Who is
so amiable, and Who has given so many proofs of His love, especially by His
constant presence with the soul, which this faithful Lover never quits, ever
accompanying it and giving it life and being. The understanding <pb n="63" id="vi.i-Page_63"/>aids
by showing that however many years life might last, no one could ever wish for
a better friend than God; that the world is full of falsehood, and that the
worldly pleasures pictured by the devil to the mind were but troubles and cares
and annoyances in disguise.</p>

<p id="vi.i-p11">10.
Reason convinces the soul that as outside its interior castle are found neither
peace nor security, it should cease to seek another home abroad, its own being
full of riches that it can enjoy at will. Besides, it is not every one who,
like itself, possesses all he needs within his own dwelling, and above all,
such a Host, Who will give it all it can desire, unless, like the prodigal son,
it chooses to go astray and feed with the swine.<note n="66" id="vi.i-p11.1">St. <scripRef passage="Luke xv. 16" id="vi.i-p11.2" parsed="|Luke|15|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.15.16">Luke xv. 16</scripRef>: &#8216;Et
cupiebat implere ventrem suum de siliquis quas porci manducabant.&#8217;</note>&#160; Surely these arguments are strong enough to
defeat the devil&#8217;s wiles! But, O my God, how the force of worldly habits and
the example of others who practise them ruin everything! Our faith is so dead
that we trust less to its teaching than to what is visible, though, indeed, we
see that worldly lives bring nothing but unhappiness. All this results from
those venomous thoughts I described, which, unless we are very careful, will
deform the soul as the sting of a viper poisons and swells the body.</p>

<p id="vi.i-p12">11.
When this happens, great care is evidently needed to cure it, and only God&#8217;s
signal mercy prevents its resulting in death. Indeed, the soul passes through
severe trials at this time, especially when the devil perceives from a person&#8217;s
character and behaviour that she is likely to make very great <pb n="64" id="vi.i-Page_64"/>progress,
for then all hell will league together to force her to turn back. O my Lord!
what need there is here that, by Thy mercy, Thou shouldst prevent the soul from
being deluded into forsaking the good begun! Enlighten it to see that its
welfare consists in perseverance in the right way, and in the withdrawing from
bad company.</p>

<p id="vi.i-p13">12.
It is of the utmost importance for the beginner to associate with those who
lead a spiritual life,<note n="67" id="vi.i-p13.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. vii. 33-37; xvi. 1 2; XXX. 6. <i>Way of Perfection</i>, ch. vi. 1; Vii. 4.</note>&#160; and not only with those in the same mansion
as herself, but with others who have travelled farther into the castle, who
will aid her greatly and draw her to join them. The soul should firmly resolve
never to submit to defeat, for if the devil sees it staunchly determined to
lose life and comfort and all that he can offer, rather than return to the
first mansion, he will the sooner leave it alone.</p>

<p id="vi.i-p14">13.
Let the Christian be valiant; let him not be like those who lay down to drink
from the brook when they went to battle (I do not remember when).<note n="68" id="vi.i-p14.1">With Gedeon.

the host of demons, and be convinced that there is no better weapon than the
cross. I have already said,<note n="69" id="vi.i-p14.3"><i>Life</i>, ch. xi 16.</note>&#160; yet it is of such importance that I repeat it
here: let no one think on starting of the reward to be reaped: this would be a
very ignoble way of commencing such a large and stately building. If built on
sand it would soon fall down.<note n="70" id="vi.i-p14.4">St.

illius magna.&#8217;</note>&#160; Souls <pb n="65" id="vi.i-Page_65"/>who
acted thus would continually suffer from discouragement and temptations, for in
these mansions no manna rains;<note n="71" id="vi.i-p14.6"><scripRef passage="Ps. lxxvii. 24" id="vi.i-p14.7" parsed="|Ps|77|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.77.24">Ps.

comes, because it desires nothing but what God wills.</p>

<p id="vi.i-p15">14.
What a farce it is! Here are we, with a thousand obstacles, drawbacks, and
imperfections within ourselves, our virtues so newly born that they have
scarcely the strength to act (and God grant that they exist at all!) yet we are
not ashamed to expect sweetness in prayer and to complain of feeling dryness.<note n="72" id="vi.i-p15.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xii. 5.</note></p>

<p id="vi.i-p16">15.
Do not act thus, sisters; embrace the cross your Spouse bore on His shoulders;
know that your motto should be: &#8216;Most happy she who suffers most if it be for
Christ!&#8217;<note n="73" id="vi.i-p16.1"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xvii. 6; xxiii. 1.</note>&#160; All else should be looked upon as secondary:
if our Lord give it you, render Him grateful thanks. You may imagine you would
be resolute in enduring external trials if God gave you interior consolations:
His Majesty knows best what is good for us; it is not for us to advise Him how
to treat us, for He has the right to tell us that we know not what we ask.<note n="74" id="vi.i-p16.2">St. <scripRef passage="Matt. xx. 22" id="vi.i-p16.3" parsed="|Matt|20|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.20.22">Matt.
xx. 22</scripRef>: &#8216;Nescitis quid petatis.&#8217;</note>&#160; Remember, it is of the greatest
importance&#8212;the sole aim of one beginning to practise prayer should be to
endure trials, and to resolve and strive to the utmost of her power to conform
her own will to the will of <pb n="66" id="vi.i-Page_66"/>
God.<note n="75" id="vi.i-p16.4"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xvi. 2. <i>Found</i>. ch. v. 2, 3. <i>Life</i>, ch. iv. II; xi. 20.</note>&#160; Be
certain that in this consists all the greatest perfection to be attained in the
spiritual life, as I will explain later. She who practises this most perfectly
will receive from God the highest reward and is the farthest advanced on the
right road. Do not imagine that we have need of a cabalistic formula or any
other occult or mysterious thing to attain it our whole welfare consists in doing
the will of God. If we start with the false principle of wishing God to follow
our will and to lead us in the way we think best, upon what firm foundation can
this spiritual edifice rest?</p>

<p id="vi.i-p17">16.
Let us endeavour to do our best: beware of the poisonous reptiles&#8212;that is to
say, the bad thoughts and aridities which are often permitted by God to assail
and torment us so that we cannot repel them. Indeed, perchance we feel their
sting! He allows this to teach us to be more on our guard in the future and to
see whether we grieve much at offending Him. Therefore if you occasionally
lapse into sin, do not lose heart and cease trying to advance, for God will
draw good even out of our falls, like the merchant who sells theriac, who first
takes poison, then the theriac, to prove the power of his elixir.<note n="76" id="vi.i-p17.1">A drug
greatly in vogue until recent times. It was composed of all the essences
supposed to contain life-giving and life-preserving qualities of animals and
plants.</note>&#160; This combat would suffice to teach us to amend
our habits if we realized our failings in no other way, and would show us the
injury we receive from a life of dissipation. Can any evil be greater than that
we find at home? What peace can we hope to find elsewhere, if we have 
none <pb n="67" id="vi.i-Page_67"/>within
us? What friends or kindred can be so close and intimate as the powers of our
soul, which, whether we will or no, must ever bear us company? These seem to
wage war on us as if they knew the harm our vices had wrought them. &#8216;Peace,
peace be unto you,&#8217; my sisters, as our Lord said, and many a time proclaimed to
His Apostles.<note n="77" id="vi.i-p17.2">St.
<scripRef passage="Luke xxiv. 36" id="vi.i-p17.3" parsed="|Luke|24|36|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.24.36">Luke xxiv. 36</scripRef>.

to obtain this peace at home, we shall never find it abroad.</p>

<p id="vi.i-p18">17.
By the blood which our Lord shed for us, I implore those who have not yet begun
to enter into themselves, to stop this warfare: I beg those already started in
the right path, not to let the combat turn them back from it. Let them reflect
that a relapse is worse than a fall, and see what ruin it would bring. They
should confide in God&#8217;s mercy, trusting nothing in themselves; then they will
see how His Majesty will lead them from one mansion to another, and will set
them in a place where these wild beasts can no more touch or annoy them, but will
be entirely at their mercy and merely objects of ridicule. Then, even in this
life, they will enjoy a far greater happiness than they are able even to
desire.</p>

<p id="vi.i-p19">18.
As I said at the beginning of this work, I have explained elsewhere<note n="78" id="vi.i-p19.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xi. and xix. 8. <i>Way of Perfection</i>, ch. xxiii. 3.</note>&#160; how you should behave when the devil thus
disturbs you. I also told you that the habit of recollection is not to be
gained by force of arms, but with calmness, which will enable you to practise
it for a longer space of time.<note n="79" id="vi.i-p19.2"><i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. xix. 3.</note>&#160; <pb n="68" id="vi.i-Page_68"/>
I will say no more now, except that I think it very helpful for those of you
who are beginners to consult persons experienced in such matters, lest you
imagine that you are injuring yourselves by leaving your prayer to perform any
necessary duties. This is not the case; our Lord will direct such things to our
profit, although we may have no one to counsel us.<note n="80" id="vi.i-p19.3"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xxiii. 3.</note>&#160; The
only remedy for having given up a habit of recollection is to recommence it,
otherwise the soul will continue to lose it more and more every day, and God
grant it may realize its danger.</p>

<p id="vi.i-p20">19.
You may think, that if it is so very injurious to desist, it would have been
better never to have begun, and to have remained outside the castle. But, as I
began by saying, and as God Himself declares: &#8216;He that loves danger shall
perish by it,&#8217;<note n="81" id="vi.i-p20.1"><scripRef passage="Ecclus. iii. 27" id="vi.i-p20.2" parsed="|Sir|3|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.3.27">Ecclus.

sometimes retiring into our souls so as to know ourselves, or thinking of our

they worth if they are not united to the merits of Jesus Christ, our only good?

<p id="vii.i-p3">1.
As for those who, by the mercy of God, have vanquished in these combats and persevered
until they reached the third mansions, what can we say to them but &#8216;Blessed is
the man that feareth the Lord&#8217;?<note n="86" id="vii.i-p3.1">Ps.
cxi: 1. &#8216;Beatus vir qui timet Dominum.&#8217;</note>&#160; It
is no small favour from God that I should be able to translate this verse into
Spanish so as to explain its meaning, considering how dense I usually am in
such matters. We may well call these souls blessed, for, as far as we can tell,
unless they turn back in their course they are on the safe road to salvation.
Now, my sisters, you see how important it is for them to conquer in their
former struggles, for I am convinced that our Lord will <pb n="71" id="vii.i-Page_71"/>henceforth
never cease to keep them in security of conscience, which is no small boon.</p>

<p id="vii.i-p4">2.
I am wrong in saying &#8216;security,&#8217; for there is no security in this life;
understand that in such cases I always imply: &#8216;If they do not cease to continue
as they have begun.&#8217; What misery to live in this world! We are like men whose
enemies are at the door, who must not lay aside their arms, even while sleeping
or eating, and are always in dread lest the foe should enter the fortress by
some breach in the walls. O my Lord and my all! How canst Thou wish us to prize
such a wretched existence? We could not desist from longing and begging Thee to
take us from it, were it not for the hope of losing it for Thy sake or devoting
it entirely to Thy service&#8212;and above all because we know it is Thy will that
we should live. Since it is so, &#8216;Let us die with Thee!&#8217;<note n="87" id="vii.i-p4.1">St. <scripRef passage="John xi. 16" id="vii.i-p4.2" parsed="|John|11|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.11.16">John xi. 16</scripRef>: &#8216;Eamus et
nos ut moriamur cum eo.&#8217;</note>&#160; as St. Thomas said, for to be away from Thee
is but to die again and again, haunted as we are by the dread of losing Thee
for ever!</p>

<p id="vii.i-p5">3.
This is why I say, daughters, that we ought to ask our Lord as our boon to
grant us one day to dwell in safety with the Saints, for with such fears, what
pleasure can she enjoy whose only pleasure is to please God? Remember, many
Saints have felt this as we do, and were even far more fervent, yet fell into
grave sin, and we cannot be sure that God would stretch forth His hand to raise
us from sin again to do such penance as they performed. This applies to
extraordinary grace.<note n="88" id="vii.i-p5.1">These
last words, in the margin, but in the handwriting of the Saint, were scored
through by one of the censors, but Fr. Luis de Leon wrote underneath, (as he
did in other cases) &#8216;Nothing to be crossed out.&#8217;</note>&#160; Truly, my <pb n="72" id="vii.i-Page_72"/>daughters,
I feel such terror as I tell you this, that I know not how to write it, nor
even how to go on living, when I reflect upon it as I very often do. Beg of His
Majesty, my daughters, to abide within me, for otherwise, what security could I
feel, after a life so badly spent as mine has been?</p>

<p id="vii.i-p6">4.
Do not grieve at knowing this. I have often seen you troubled when I spoke
about it, for you wish that my past had been a very holy one, in which you are
right&#8212;indeed, I wish the same myself. But what can be done, now that I have
wasted it entirely through my own fault? I have no right to complain that God
withheld the aid I needed to fulfil your wishes. It is impossible for me to
write this without tears and great shame, when I see that I am explaining these
matters to those capable of teaching me. What a hard task has obedience laid,
upon me! God grant that, as I do it for Him, it may be of some service to you;
therefore beg Him to pardon me for my miserable presumption.</p>

<p id="vii.i-p7">5.
His Majesty knows that I have nothing to rely upon but His mercy; as I cannot
cancel the past, I have no other remedy but to flee to Him, and to confide in
the merits of His Son and of His Virgin Mother, whose habit, unworthy as I am,
I wear as you do also. Praise Him, then, my daughters, for making you truly
daughters of our Lady, so that you need not blush for my wickedness as you have
such a good Mother. Imitate her; think how great she must be and what a
blessing it is for you to have her for a patroness, since my sins and evil <pb n="73" id="vii.i-Page_73"/>character
have brought no tarnish on the lustre of our holy Order.</p>

<p id="vii.i-p8">6.
Still I must give you one warning: be not too confident because you are nuns
and the daughters of such a Mother. David was very holy, yet you know what
Solomon became.<note n="89" id="vii.i-p8.1">St.
Teresa wrote &#8216;Solomon&#8217;; Father Gracian corrected &#8216;Absalom,&#8217; and Fr. Luis de
Leon restored the original text.</note>&#160; Therefore do not rely on your enclosure, on
your penitential life, nor on your continual exercise of prayer and constant
communion with God, nor trust in having left the world or in the idea that you
hold its ways in horror. All this is good, but is not enough, as I have already
said, to remove all fear; therefore meditate on this text and often recall it:
&#8217;Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord.&#8217;<note n="90" id="vii.i-p8.2"><scripRef passage="Ps. cxi. 1" id="vii.i-p8.3" parsed="|Ps|111|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.111.1">Ps. cxi. 1</scripRef>.</note></p>

<p id="vii.i-p9">7.
I do not recollect what I was saying, and have digressed very much: for when I
think of myself my mind cannot soar to higher things but is like a bird with
broken wings; so I will leave this subject for the present.</p>

<p id="vii.i-p10">8.
To return to what I began to explain about the souls which have entered the
third mansions. God has shown them no small favour, but a very great one, in
enabling them to pass through the first difficulties. Thanks to His mercy I
believe there are many such people in the world: they are very desirous not to
offend His Majesty even by venial sins, they love penance and spend hours in
meditation, they employ their time well, exercise themselves in works of
charity to their neighbours, are well-ordered in their conversation and dress, <pb n="74" id="vii.i-Page_74"/>and
those who own a household govern it well. This is certainly to be desired, and
there appears no reason to forbid their entrance to the last mansions; nor will
our Lord deny it them if they desire it, for this is the right disposition for
receiving all His favours.</p>

<p id="vii.i-p11">9.
O Jesus! can any one declare that he does not desire this great blessing,
especially after he has passed through the chief difficulties? No; no one can!
We all say we desire it, but there is need of more than that for the Lord to
possess entire dominion over the soul. It is not enough to say so, any more
than it was enough for the young man when our Lord told him what he must do if
he desired to be perfect.<note n="91" id="vii.i-p11.1"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 21" id="vii.i-p11.2" parsed="|Matt|19|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.21">Matt.
xix. 21</scripRef>.</note>&#160; Since I began to speak of these
dwelling-rooms I have him constantly before my mind, for we are exactly like
him; this very frequently produces the great dryness we feel in prayer, though
sometimes it proceeds from other causes as well. I am not speaking of certain
interior sufferings which give intolerable pain to many devout souls through no
fault of their own; from these trials, however, our Lord always delivers them
with much profit to themselves. I also except people who suffer from melancholy
and other infirmities. But in these cases, as in all others, we must leave
aside the judgments of God.</p>

<p id="vii.i-p12">10.
I hold that these effects usually result from the first cause I mentioned; such
souls know that nothing would induce them to commit a sin (many of them would
not even commit a venial sin <pb n="75" id="vii.i-Page_75"/>advertently),
and that they employ their life and riches well. They cannot, therefore,
patiently endure to be excluded from the presence of our King, Whose vassals
they consider themselves, as indeed they are. An earthly king may have many
subjects yet all do not enter his court. Enter then, enter, my daughters, into
your interior; pass beyond the thought of your own petty works, which are no
more, nor even as much, as Christians are bound to perform: let it suffice that
you are God&#8217;s servants, do not pursue so much as to catch nothing.<note n="92" id="vii.i-p12.1">Proverbially,
like &#8216;having too many irons in the fire.&#8217;</note>&#160; Think of the saints, who have entered the
Divine Presence, and you will see the difference between them and ourselves.</p>

<p id="vii.i-p13">11.
Do not ask for what you do not deserve, nor should we ever think, however much
we may have done for God, that we merit the reward of the saints, for we have
offended Him. Oh, humility, humility! I know not why, but I am always tempted
to think that persons who complain so much of aridities must be a little
wanting in this virtue. However, I am not speaking of severe interior
sufferings, which are far worse than a want of devotion.</p>

<p id="vii.i-p14">12.
Let us try ourselves, my sisters, or let our Lord try us; He knows well how to
do so (although we often pretend to misunderstand Him). We will now speak of
these well-ordered souls. Let us consider what they do for God and we shall see
at once what little right we have to murmur against His Majesty. If we turn our
backs on Him and go away sorrowfully like the youth in the Gospel<note n="93" id="vii.i-p14.1">St. <scripRef passage="Mark. x. 22" id="vii.i-p14.2" parsed="|Mark|10|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.10.22">Mark. x.
22</scripRef>. <i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. xvii. 5.</note> <pb n="76" id="vii.i-Page_76"/>when
He tells us what to do to be perfect, what can God do? for He must proportion
the reward to our love for Him. This love, my daughters, must not be the fabric
of our imagination; we must prove it by our works. Yet do not suppose that our
Lord has need of any works of ours; He only expels us to manifest our goodwill.<note n="94" id="vii.i-p14.3"><i>Rel</i>. ix. 15.</note></p>

<p id="vii.i-p15">13.
It seems to us we have done everything by taking the religious habit of our own
will, and renouncing worldly things and all our possessions for God (although
they may have been but the nets of St. Peter,<note n="95" id="vii.i-p15.1">St. <scripRef passage="Matt. iv. 20" id="vii.i-p15.2" parsed="|Matt|4|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.4.20">Matt. iv. 20</scripRef>: &#8216;Relictis
retibus secuti sunt eum.&#8217;</note>&#160; yet they seemed much to us, for they were our
all). This is an excellent disposition: if we continue in it and do not return,
even in desire, to the company of the reptiles of the first rooms, doubtless,
by persevering in this poverty and detachment of soul, we shall obtain all for
which we strive. But, mark this&#8212;it must be on one condition&#8212;that we &#8216;hold
ourselves for unprofitable servants,&#8217;<note n="96" id="vii.i-p15.3">St. <scripRef passage="Luke xvii. 10" id="vii.i-p15.4" parsed="|Luke|17|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.17.10">Luke xvii. 10</scripRef>: &#8216;Servi inutiles sumus:
quod debuimus facere fecimus.&#8217;</note>&#160; as we are told either by St. Paul or by
Christ, and that we do not consider that our Lord is bound to grant us any
favours, but that, as we have received more from Him, we are the deeper in His
debt.</p>

<p id="vii.i-p16">14.
How little is all we can do for so generous a God, Who died for us, Who created
us, Who gives us being, that we should not think ourselves happy to be able to
acquit ourselves of part of the debt we owe Him for having served us, without
asking Him for fresh mercies and favours? I am loath to <pb n="77" id="vii.i-Page_77"/>use
this expression, yet so it is, for He did nothing else during the whole time He
lived in this world but serve us.</p>

<p id="vii.i-p17">15.
Think well my daughters, over some of the points I have treated, although
confusedly, for I do not know how to explain them better. Our Lord will make
you understand them, that you may reap humility from your dryness, instead of
the disquietude the devil strives to cause by it. I believe that where true
humility exists, although God should never bestow consolations, yet He gives a
peace and resignation which make the soul happier than are others with sensible
devotion. These consolations, as you have read, are often given by the Divine
Majesty to the weakest souls who, I suppose would not exchange them for the
fortitude of Christians serving God in aridities: we love consolations better
than the cross! Do Thou, O Lord, Who knowest all truth, so prove us that we may
know ourselves.</p>

<p class="Centered" id="vii.ii-p1">CONTINUES
THE SAME SUBJECT AND SPEAKS OF ARIDITIES IN PRAYER AND THEIR RESULTS: OF THE NECESSITY
OF TRYING OURSELVES AND HOW OUR LORD PROVES THOSE WHO ARE IN THESE MANSIONS.</p>

<p id="vii.ii-p3">1.
I HAVE known some, in fact, I may say numerous souls, who have reached this
state, and for many years lived, apparently, a regular and well-ordered life,
both of body and mind. It would seem that they must have gained the mastery
over this world, or at least be extremely detached from it, yet if His Majesty
sends very moderate trials they become so disturbed and disheartened as not
only to astonish but to make me anxious about them. Advice is useless; having practised
virtue for so long they <pb n="79" id="vii.ii-Page_79"/>think
themselves capable of teaching it, and believe that they have abundant reason
to feel miserable.</p>

<p id="vii.ii-p4">2.
The only way to help them is to compassionate their troubles;<note n="97" id="vii.ii-p4.1">See letter concerning
Francisco de Salcedo. Nov. 1576. Vol. II.</note>&#160; indeed, one cannot but feel sorry at seeing
people in such an unhappy state. They must not be argued with, for they are
convinced they suffer only for God&#8217;s sake, and cannot be made to understand
they are acting imperfectly, which is a further error in persons so far
advanced. No wonder that they should feel these trials for a time, but I think
they ought speedily to overcome their concern about such matters. God, wishing
His elect to realize their own misery, often temporarily withdraws His favours:
no more is needed to prove to us in a very short time what we really are.<note n="98" id="vii.ii-p4.2"><i>Way of Perf</i>. ch, xxxviii. 7.</note></p>

<p id="vii.ii-p5">3.
Souls soon learn in this way; they perceive their faults very clearly, and
sometimes the discovery of how quickly they are overcome by but slight earthly
trials is more painful than the subtraction of God&#8217;s sensible favours. I
consider that God thus shows them great mercy, for though their behaviour may
be faulty, yet they gain greatly in humility. Not so with the people of whom I
first spoke; they believe their conduct is saintly, and wish others to agree
with them. I will give you some examples which will help us to understand and
to try ourselves, without waiting for God to try us, since it would be far
better to have prepared and examined ourselves beforehand.</p>

<p id="vii.ii-p6">4.
A rich man, without son or heir, loses part of <pb n="80" id="vii.ii-Page_80"/>his
property,<note n="99" id="vii.ii-p6.1"><i>Way of Perf</i>. ch, xxxviii, 10. <i>Concep</i>. ch. ii. 11, 12. <i>Life</i>, xi. 3.</note>&#160; but still has more than enough to keep
himself and his household. If this misfortune grieves and disquiets him as
though he were left to beg his bread, how can our Lord ask him to give up all
things for His sake? This man will tell you he regrets losing his money because
he wished to bestow it on the poor.</p>

<p id="vii.ii-p7">5.
I believe His Majesty would prefer me to conform to His will, and keep peace of
soul while attending to my interests, to such charity as this. If this person
cannot resign himself because God has not raised him so high in virtue, well
and good: let him know that he is wanting in liberty of spirit; let him beg our
Lord to grant it him, and be rightly disposed to receive it. Another person has
more than sufficient means to live on, when an opportunity occurs for acquiring
more property: if it is offered him, by all means let him accept it; but if he
must go out of his way to obtain it and then continues working to gain more and
more&#8212;however good his intention may be (and it must be good, for I am speaking
of people who lead prayerful and good lives), he cannot possibly enter the
mansions near the King.</p>

<p id="vii.ii-p8">6.
Something of the same sort happens if such people meet with contempt or want of
due respect. God often gives them grace to bear it well, as He loves to see
virtue upheld in public, and will not have it condemned in those who practise
it, or else because these persons have served Him faithfully, and He, our
supreme Good, is exceedingly good to us all; nevertheless, these persons are
disturbed, and <pb n="81" id="vii.ii-Page_81"/>cannot
overcome or get rid of the feeling for some time.<note n="100" id="vii.ii-p8.1"><i>Way of Perf.</i>. ch. xxxviii. 12.</note>&#160; Alas! have they not long meditated on the
pains our Lord endured and how well it is for us to suffer, and have even
longed to do so? They wish every one were as virtuous as they are; and God
grant they do not consider other people to blame for their troubles and
attribute merit to themselves!</p>

<p id="vii.ii-p9">7.
You may think, my daughters, that I have wandered from the subject, for all
this does not concern you: nothing of the sort occurs to us here, where we
neither own nor wish for any property, nor endeavour to gain it, and no one
does us any wrong. The instances I have mentioned do not coincide exactly, yet
conclusions applicable to us may be drawn from them, which it would be neither
well nor necessary to state. These will teach you whether you are really
detached from all you have left; trifling occasions often occur, although
perhaps not quite of the same kind, by which you can prove to yourselves
whether you have obtained the mastery over your passions.</p>

<p id="vii.ii-p10">8.
Believe me, the question is not whether we wear the religious habit or not, but
whether we practise the virtues and submit our will in all things to the will
of God. The object of our life must be to do what He requires of us: let us not
ask that <i>our</i> will may be done, but <i>His</i>. If we have not yet attained to
this, let us be humble, as I said above. Humility is the ointment for our
wounds; if we have it, although perhaps He may defer His coming for a time,
God, Who is our Physician, will come and heal us. <pb n="82" id="vii.ii-Page_82"/>9.
The penances performed by the persons I spoke of are as well regulated as their
life, which they value very highly because they wish to serve our Lord with
it&#8212;in which there is nothing to blame&#8212;so they are very discreet in their
mortifications lest they should injure their health. Never fear they will kill
themselves: they are far too sensible! Their love is not strong enough to
overcome their reason; I wish it were&#8212;that they might not be content to creep
on their way to God: a pace that will never bring them to their journey&#8217;s end!</p>

<p id="vii.ii-p11">10.
We seem to ourselves to be making progress, yet we become weary, for, believe
me, we are walking through a mist; it will be fortunate if we do not lose
ourselves. Do you think, my daughters, if we could travel from one country to
another in eight days, that it would be well to spend a year on the journey,
through wind, snow, and inundations and over bad roads?<note n="101" id="vii.ii-p11.1">St. Teresa very probably had
in her mind her journey, to make a foundation at Seville, when the boat, which
was crossing the Guadalquivir, narrowly escaped being carried down the river by
the current. <i>Found</i>. ch. xxiv, 6</note>&#160; Would it not be better to get it over at
once, for it is full of dangers and serpents? Oh, how many striking instances
could I give you of this! God grant that I have passed beyond this state
myself: often I think that I have not.</p>

<p id="vii.ii-p12">11.
All things obstruct us while prudence rules our actions; we are afraid of
everything and therefore fear to make progress&#8212;as if we could reach the inner
chambers while others make the journey for us! As this is impossible, sisters,
for the love of God let us exert ourselves, and leave our reason and <pb n="83" id="vii.ii-Page_83"/>our
fears in His hands, paying no attention to the weaknesses of nature which might
retard us. Let our Superiors, to whom the charge belongs, look after our
bodies; let our only care be to hasten to our Lord&#8217;s presence&#8212;for though there
are few or no indulgences to be obtained here, yet, regard for health might
mislead us and it would be none the better for our care, as I know well.</p>

<p id="vii.ii-p13">12.
I know, too, that our bodies are not the chief factors in the work we have
before us; they are accessory: extreme humility is the principal point. It is
the want of this, I believe, that stops people&#8217;s progress. It may seem that we
have made but little way: we should believe that is the case, and that our
sisters are advancing much more rapidly than we are. Not only should we wish
others to consider us the worst of all; we should endeavour to make them think
so. If we act in this manner, our soul will do well; otherwise we shall make no
progress and shall always remain the prey to a thousand troubles and miseries.
The way will be difficult and wearisome without self-renunciation, weighed down
as we are by the burden and frailties of human nature, which are no longer felt
in the more interior mansions.</p>

<p id="vii.ii-p14">13.
In these third mansions the Lord never fails to repay our services, both as a
just and even as a merciful God, Who always bestows on us far more than we
deserve, giving us greater happiness than could be obtained from any earthly
pleasures and amusements. I think He grants few consolations here, except,
perhaps, occasionally to entice us to <pb n="84" id="vii.ii-Page_84"/>prepare
ourselves to enter the last mansions by showing us their contents. There may <i>appear</i> to you to be no difference except
in name between sensible devotion, and consolations and you may ask why I
distinguish them. I think there <i>is</i> a
very great difference, but I may be mistaken.</p>

<p id="vii.ii-p15">14.
This will be best explained while writing of the fourth mansion, which comes
next, when I must speak of the consolations received there from our Lord. The
subject may appear futile, yet may prove useful by urging souls who know what
each mansion contains to strive to enter the best. It will solace those whom
God has advanced so far; others, who thought they had reached the summit, will
be abashed, yet if they are humble they will be led to thank God.</p>

<p id="vii.ii-p16">15.
Those who do not receive these consolations may feel a despondency that is
uncalled for, since perfection does not consist in consolation but in greater
love; our reward will be in proportion to this, and to the justice and
sincerity of our actions. Perhaps you wonder, then, why I treat of these
interior favours and their nature. I do not know; ask him who bade me write
this. I must obey Superiors, not argue with them, which I have no right to do.</p>

<p id="vii.ii-p17">16.
I assure you that when I had neither received these favours,<note n="102" id="vii.ii-p17.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xii. 2. <i>Rel</i>.
vii. 3.</note>&#160; nor understood them by experience, or ever
expected to (and rightly so, for I should have felt reassured if I had known or
even conjectured that I was pleasing to God in any way), <pb n="85" id="vii.ii-Page_85"/>yet
when I read of the mercies and consolations that our Lord grants to His
servants, I was delighted and praised Him fervently. If such as myself acted
thus, how much more would the humble and good glorify Him! I think it is worth
while to explain these subjects and show what consolations and delights we lose
through our own fault, if only for the sake of moving a single soul to praise
God once.</p>

<p id="vii.ii-p18">17.
When these joys are from God they come laden with love and strength, which aid
the soul on its way and increase its good works and virtues. Do not imagine
that it is unimportant whether you try to obtain these graces or no; if you are
not to blame, the Lord is just: what He refuses in one way, His Majesty will
give you in another, as He knows how; His secret ways are very mysterious, and
doubtless He will do what is best for you.</p>

<p id="vii.ii-p19">18.
Souls who by God&#8217;s mercy are brought so far (which, as I said, is no small
mercy, for they are likely to ascend still higher) will be greatly benefited by
practising prompt obedience. Even if they are not in the religious state, it
would be well if they, like certain other people, were to take a director,<note n="103" id="vii.ii-p19.1"><i>Life</i>. ch. xiii. 29.</note>&#160; so as never to follow their own will, which
is the cause of most of our ills. They should not choose one of their own turn
of mind<note n="104" id="vii.ii-p19.2"><i>Rel</i>. vii. 18.</note>&#160; (as the saying goes), who is over prudent in
his actions, but should select one thoroughly detached from worldly things; it
is very helpful to consult a person who has learnt and can teach this. It is
encouraging to see that trials which seemed to us impossible to <pb n="86" id="vii.ii-Page_86"/>submit
to are possible to others, and that they bear them sweetly. Their flight makes
us try to soar, like nestlings taught by the elder birds, who, though they
cannot fly far at first, little by little imitate their parents: I know the
great benefit of this. However determined such persons may be not to offend our
Lord, they must not expose themselves to temptation: they are still near the
first mansions to which they might easily return. Their strength is not yet
established on a solid foundation like that of souls exercised in sufferings,
who know how little cause there is to fear the tempests of this world and care
nothing for its pleasures: beginners might succumb before any severe trial.
Some great persecution, such as the devil knows how to raise to injure us,
might make beginners turn back; while zealously trying to withdraw others from
sin they might succumb to the attacks made upon them.</p>

<p id="vii.ii-p20">19.
Let us look at our own faults, and not at other persons&#8217;. People who are
extremely correct themselves are often shocked at everything they see<note n="105" id="vii.ii-p20.1"><i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. vii. 6. <i>Castle</i>, M. I. ch. ii. 20, 21.</note> ; however,
we might often learn a great deal that is essential from the very persons whom
we censure. Our exterior comportment and manners may be better&#8212;this is well
enough, but not of the first importance. We ought not to insist on every one
following in our footsteps, nor to take upon ourselves to give instructions in
spirituality when, perhaps, we do not even know what it is. Zeal for the good
of souls, though given us by God, may <pb n="87" id="vii.ii-Page_87"/>often
lead us astray, sisters; it is best to keep our rule, which bids us ever to
live in silence and in hope.<note n="106" id="vii.ii-p20.2"><scripRef passage="Isa. xxx. 15" id="vii.ii-p20.3" parsed="|Isa|30|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.30.15">Isa.

Him; and if we beg His Majesty to do so, by His grace we shall be able to aid
them greatly. May He be for ever blessed!</p>

SWEETNESS AND TENDERNESS IN PRAYER DIFFER FROM CONSOLATIONS. EXPLAINS HOW
ADVANTAGEOUS IT WAS FOR ST. TERESA TO COMPREHEND THAT THE IMAGINATION AND THE
UNDERSTANDING ARE NOT THE SAME THING. THIS CHAPTER IS USEFUL FOR THOSE WHOSE

<p id="viii.i-p3">1.
Now that I commence writing about the fourth mansions, it is requisite, as I
said,<note n="107" id="viii.i-p3.1">First
Mansions, ch. i. 1.</note>&#160; to commend myself to the Holy Ghost and to
beg Him henceforth to speak for me, that I may be enabled to treat these
matters intelligibly. Henceforth they begin to be supernatural and it will be
most difficult to speak clearly about them,<note n="108" id="viii.i-p3.2">There are two kinds of
contemplation: acquired or natural, and infused or supernatural. In their
widest sense, including many remarkable phenomena of Natural religion, and, of
course, the most wonderful manifestations recorded in the Old Testament, they
form the system called Mysticism and are the proper object of Mystical
theology. Natural or acquired contemplation is based upon an idealistic turn of
mind which enables the soul to gaze upon the Godhead (simple gaze, as St.
Teresa calls it) without approaching Him by the laborious process of reasoning,
and in so doing embraces Him with its affective powers; like a person who,
devoid of technical skill, takes in and is enamoured by, the beauty of a
painting. Infused contemplation is the highest act of the Gifts of the Holy
Ghost of Knowledge and Wisdom. It is often impossible, nor is it always
essential, to determine where acquired contemplation ends and infused
contemplation begins. But it should be borne in mind that both the one and the
other are operations and not merely a passive state or mere fruition. Even the
highest form of contemplation, the Beatific Vision, is a supernatural act of
the soul, an operation of unending duration. A ship moved by a gentle breeze is
rightly said to be actually sailing though the rowers are at rest.</note>&#160; unless His Majesty <pb n="89" id="viii.i-Page_89"/>undertakes
it for me, as He did when I explained the subject (as far as I understood it)
somewhat about fourteen years ago.<note n="109" id="viii.i-p3.3"><i>Life</i>, ch. xii. 11.</note>&#160; I believe I now possess more light about the
favours God grants some souls, but that is different from being able to
elucidate them.<note n="110" id="viii.i-p3.4"><i>Life</i>, ch. xvii. 7.</note>&#160; May His Majesty enable me to do so if it
would be useful, but not otherwise.</p>

<p id="viii.i-p4">2.
As these mansions are nearer the King&#8217;s dwelling they are very beautiful, and
so subtle are the things seen and heard in them, that, as those tell us who
have tried to do so, the mind cannot give a lucid idea of them to those
inexperienced in the matter. People who have enjoyed these favours, especially
if it was to any great extent, will easily comprehend me.</p>

<p id="viii.i-p5">3.
Apparently a person must have dwelt for a long time in the former mansions
before entering these; although in ordinary cases the soul must have been in
the last one spoken of, yet, as you must often have heard, there is no fixed
rule, for God gives when, <pb n="90" id="viii.i-Page_90"/>how,
and to whom He wills<note n="111" id="viii.i-p5.1">Philippus

goods are His own, and His choice wrongs no one.<note n="112" id="viii.i-p5.2">S. <scripRef passage="Matt. xx. 15" id="viii.i-p5.3" parsed="|Matt|20|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.20.15">Matt. xx. 15</scripRef>: &#8216;Aut non
licet mihi quod volo facere?&#8217;</note>&#160; The poisonous reptiles rarely come into these
rooms, and, if they enter, do more good than harm. I think it is far better for
them to get in and make war on the soul in this state of prayer; were it not
tempted, the devil might sometimes deceive it about divine consolations, thus
injuring it far more. Besides, the soul would benefit less, because all
occasions of gaining merit would be withdrawn, were it left continually
absorbed in God. I am not confident that this absorption is genuine when it
always remains in the same state, nor does it appear to me possible for the
Holy Ghost to dwell constantly within us, to the same extent, during our
earthly exile.</p>

<p id="viii.i-p6">4.
I will now describe, as I promised, the difference between sweetness in prayer
and spiritual consolations. It appears to me that what we acquire for ourselves
in meditation and petitions to our Lord may be termed &#8216;sweetness in devotion.&#8217;<note n="113" id="viii.i-p6.1"><i>Way of Perf</i>., ch. xix. 8. <i>Castle</i>, M. iv. ch. ii. 4. The first
three mansions of the Interior Castle correspond with the &#8216;first water,&#8217; or the
prayer of Meditation, explained in ch. xi-xiii. of the Life; the fourth
mansion, or the prayer of Quiet, with the &#8216;second water,&#8217; Life, ch. xiv. and
xv.; the fifth mansion, or the prayer of Union, with the &#8216;third water,&#8217; Life,
ch. xvi. and xvii.; and the sixth mansion, ecstasy, etc., with the &#8216;fourth
water,&#8217; Life, ch. xviii.-xxi.</note>&#160; It is natural, although ultimately aided by
the grace of God. I must be understood to imply this in all I say, for we can
do nothing without Him. This <pb n="91" id="viii.i-Page_91"/>sweetness
arises principally from the good work we perform, and appears to result from
our labours: well may we feel happy at having thus spent our time. We shall
find, on consideration, that many temporal matters give us the same
pleasure&#8212;such as unexpectedly coming into a large fortune, suddenly meeting
with a dearly-loved friend, or succeeding in any important or influential
affair which makes a sensation in the world. Again, it would be felt by one who
had been told her husband, brother, or son was dead, and who saw him return to
her alive. I have seen people weep from such happiness, as I have done myself.
I consider both these joys and those we feel in religious matters to be natural
ones. Although there is nothing wrong about the former, yet those produced by
devotion spring from a more noble source&#8212;in short, they begin in ourselves and
end in God. Spiritual consolations, on the contrary, arise from God, and our
nature feels them and rejoices as keenly in them, and indeed far more keenly,
than in the others I described.</p>

<p id="viii.i-p7">5.
O Jesus! how I wish I could elucidate this point! It seems to me that I can
perfectly distinguish the difference between the two joys, yet I have not the
skill to make myself understood; may God give it me! I remember a verse we say
at Prime at the end of the final Psalm; the last words are: &#8216;Cum dilatasti cor
meum&#8217;&#8212;&#8216;When Thou didst dilate my heart:<note n="114" id="viii.i-p7.1"><scripRef passage="Ps. cxviii. 32" id="viii.i-p7.2" parsed="|Ps|118|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.118.32">Ps. cxviii. 32</scripRef>. <i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. xxviii. 11.</note>&#160; To
those with much experience, this suffices to show the difference between
sweetness in prayer and spiritual consolations; other people will <pb n="92" id="viii.i-Page_92"/>require
more explanation. The sensible devotion I mentioned does not dilate the heart,
but generally appears to narrow it slightly; although joyful at seeing herself
work for God, yet such a person sheds tears of sorrow which seem partly
produced by the passions. I know little about the passions of the soul, or I
could write of them more clearly and could better define what comes from the
sensitive disposition and what is natural, having passed through this state
myself, but I am very stupid. Knowledge and learning are a great advantage to
every one.</p>

<p id="viii.i-p8">6.
My own experience of this delight and sweetness in meditation was that when I
began to weep over the Passion I could not stop until I had a severe headache;<note n="115" id="viii.i-p8.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. iii. 1.</note>&#160; the same thing occurred when I grieved over
my sins: this was a great grace from our Lord. I do not intend to inquire now
which of these states of prayer is the better, but I wish I knew how to explain
the difference between the two. In that of which I speak, the tears and good
desires are often partly caused by the natural disposition, but although this
may be the case, yet, as I said, these feelings terminate in God. Sensible
devotion is very desirable if the soul is humble enough to understand that it
is not more holy on account of these sentiments, which cannot always with
certainty be ascribed to charity, and even then are still the gift of God.</p>

<p id="viii.i-p9">7.
These feelings of devotion are most common with souls in the first three
mansions, who are nearly always using their understanding and reason <pb n="93" id="viii.i-Page_93"/>in
making meditations. This is good for them, for they have not been given grace
for more; they should, however, try occasionally to elicit some acts such as
praising God, rejoicing in His goodness and that He is what He is: let them
desire that He may be honoured and glorified. They must do this as best they
can, for it greatly inflames the will. Let them be very careful, when God gives
these sentiments, not to set them aside in order to finish their accustomed
meditation. But, having spoken fully on this subject elsewhere,<note n="116" id="viii.i-p9.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xii. 2-4..</note>&#160; I will say no more now. I only wish to warn
you that to make rapid progress and to reach the mansions we wish to enter, it
is not so essential to <i>think</i> much as
to <i>love</i> much: therefore you must
practise whatever most excites you to this. Perhaps we do not know what love
is, nor does this greatly surprise me. Love does not consist in great sweetness
of devotion, but in a fervent determination to strive to please God in all
things, in avoiding, as far as possible, all that would offend Him, and in
praying for the increase of the glory and honour of His Son and for the growth
of the Catholic Church. These are the signs of love; do not imagine that it
consists in never thinking of anything but God, and that if your thoughts
wander a little all is lost.<note n="117" id="viii.i-p9.2"><i>Found</i>. ch. v. 2. <i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xxxi. 6, 12. <i>Life</i>,
ch. xv, 16, ch. XXX. 19.</note>
</p>

<p id="viii.i-p10">8.
I, myself, have sometimes been troubled by this turmoil of thoughts. I learnt
by experience, but little more than four years ago, that our thoughts, or it is
clearer to call it our imagination, are not <pb n="94" id="viii.i-Page_94"/>the
same thing as the understanding. I questioned a theologian on the subject; he
told me it was the fact, which consoled me not a little. As the understanding
is one of the powers of the soul, it puzzled me to see it so sluggish at times,
while, as a rule, the imagination takes flight at once, so that God alone can
control it by so uniting us to Himself<note n="118" id="viii.i-p10.1"><i>Life</i>,
ch. xv. 9, 10.</note>&#160; that we seem, in a manner, detached from our
bodies. It puzzled me to see that while to all appearance the powers of the
soul were occupied with God and recollected in Him, the imagination was
wandering elsewhere.</p>

<p id="viii.i-p11">9.
Do Thou, O Lord, take into account all that we suffer in this way through our
ignorance. We err in thinking that we need only know that we must keep our
thoughts fixed on Thee. We do not understand that we should consult those
better instructed than ourselves, nor are we aware that there is anything for
us to learn. We pass through terrible trials, on account of not understanding
our own nature and take what is not merely harmless, but good, for a grave
fault. This causes the sufferings felt by many people, particularly by the
unlearned, who practise prayer. They complain of interior trials, become
melancholy, lose their health, and even give up prayer altogether for want of
recognizing that we have within ourselves as it were, an interior world. We
cannot stop the revolution of the heavens as they rush with velocity upon their
course, neither can we control our imagination. When this wanders we at once
imagine that all the powers of the soul follow it; we think everything <pb n="95" id="viii.i-Page_95"/>is
lost, and that the time spent in God&#8217;s presence is wasted. Meanwhile, the soul
is perhaps entirely united to Him in the innermost mansions, while the
imagination is in the precincts of the castle, struggling with a thousand wild
and venomous creatures and gaining merit by its warfare. Therefore we need not
let ourselves be disturbed, nor give up prayer, as the devil is striving to
persuade us. As a rule, all our anxieties and troubles come from misunderstanding
our own nature.</p>

<p id="viii.i-p12">10.
Whilst writing this I am thinking of the loud noise in my head which I
mentioned in the Introduction, and which has made it almost impossible to obey
the command given me to write this. It sounds as if there were a number of rushing
waterfalls within my brain, while in other parts, drowned by the sound of the
waters, are the voices of birds singing and whistling. This tumult is not in my
ears, but in the upper part of my head, where, they say, is placed the superior
part of the soul. I have long thought that this must be so because the flight
of the spirit seems to take place from this part with great velocity.<note n="119" id="viii.i-p12.1">Second
Relation addressed to Fr. Rodrigo Alvarez.</note>&#160; Please God I may recollect to explain the
cause when writing of the latter mansions, this not being the proper place for
it. It may be that God has sent this suffering in my head to help me to
understand the matter, for all this tumult in my brain does not interfere with
my prayer, nor with my speaking to you, but the great calm and love and desires
in my soul remain undisturbed and my mind is clear.</p>

<p id="viii.i-p13">11.
How, then, can the superior part of the soul <pb n="96" id="viii.i-Page_96"/>remain
undisturbed if it resides in the upper part of the brain? I cannot account for
it, but am sure that I am speaking the truth. This noise disturbs my prayer
when unaccompanied with ecstasy, but when it is ecstatic I do not feel any
pain, however great. I should suffer keenly were I forced to cease praying on
account of these infirmities. We should not be distressed by reason of our
thoughts, nor allow ourselves to be worried by them: if they come from the
devil, he will let us alone if we take no notice of them; and if they are, as
often happens, one of the many frailties entailed by Adam&#8217;s sin, let us be patient
and suffer them for the love of God. Likewise, since we must eat and sleep
without being able to avoid it, much to our grief, let us acknowledge that we
are human, and long to be where no one may despise us.<note n="120" id="viii.i-p13.1"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xxxiii. 8. <i>Life</i>,
ch. xxi. S. Rel. ii. 12.</note>&#160; Sometimes I recall these words, spoken by the
Spouse in the Canticle;<note n="121" id="viii.i-p13.2">According
to Fr. Gracian the Saint here refers to <scripRef passage="Cant. viii. 1" id="viii.i-p13.3" parsed="|Song|8|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Song.8.1">Cant. viii. 1</scripRef>: &#8216;Et jam me nemo
despiciat.&#8217;</note>&#160; truly never in our lives have we better
reason to say them, for I think no earthly scorn or suffering can try us so
severely as these struggles within our souls. All uneasiness or conflict can be
borne while we have peace in ourselves, as I said; but if, while seeking for
rest amidst the thousand trials of the world&#8212;knowing that God has prepared
this rest for us&#8212;the obstacle is found in ourselves, the trial must prove painful and almost insufferable.</p>

<p id="viii.i-p14">12.
Take us therefore, O Lord, to where these miseries can no longer cause us to be
despised, for <pb n="97" id="viii.i-Page_97"/>sometimes
it seems as if they mocked our souls. Even in this life God delivers us from
them when we reach the last mansion, as by His grace I will show you. Everybody
is not so violently distressed and assaulted by these weaknesses as I have been
for many years,<note n="122" id="viii.i-p14.1"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xvii. 2.</note>&#160; on account of my wickedness, so that it seems
as if I strove to take vengeance on myself.<note n="123" id="viii.i-p14.2"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch, xxxi. 9.</note>&#160;
Since I suffer so much in this way, perhaps you may do the same, so I
shall continue to explain the subject to you in different ways, in order to
find some means of making it clear. The thing is inevitable, therefore do not
let it disturb or grieve you, but let the mill clack on while we grind our
wheat; that is, let us continue to work with our will and intellect.</p>

<p id="viii.i-p15">13.
These troubles annoy us more or less according to the state of our health or in
different circumstances. The poor soul suffers; although not now to blame, it
has sinned at other times, and must be patient. We are so ignorant that what we
have read and been told has not sufficed to teach us to disregard wandering
thoughts, therefore I shall not be wasting time in instructing and consoling
you about these trials. However, this will help you but little until God
chooses to enlighten you, and additional measures are needed: His Majesty
wishes us to learn by ordinary means to understand ourselves and to recognize
the share taken in these troubles by our wandering imagination, our nature, and
the devil&#8217;s temptations, instead of laying all the blame on our souls.</p>

<p id="viii.ii-p4">1.
GOD help me! how I have wandered from my subject! I forget what I was speaking
about, for my occupations and ill-health often force me to cease writing until
some more suitable time. The sense will be very disconnected; as my memory is
extremely bad and I have no time to read over what is written, even what I
really understand is expressed very vaguely, at least so I fear. I think I said
that spiritual consolations are occasionally connected with the passions. These
feelings of devotion produce fits of sobbing; I have even heard that sometimes
they cause a compression of the chest, and uncontrollable exterior motions
violent enough to cause bleeding at the nose and other painful effects.<note n="124" id="viii.ii-p4.1">&#8217;A clear
description of an attack of hysteria with the significant remark that she
herself had never experienced anything of the kind&#8217;. (Dr. Goix, quoted by P. Gr&#233;goire, <i>La pr&#233;tendue hyst&#233;rie de Sainte Th&#233;r&#232;se</i>,
Lyon, Vitte, 1895, p. 53.)</note></p>

<p id="viii.ii-p5">2.
I can say nothing about this, never having experienced anything of the kind
myself; but there appears some cause for comfort in it, because, as I said, all
ends in the desire to please God and to <pb n="99" id="viii.ii-Page_99"/>enjoy
His presence. What I call divine consolations, or have termed elsewhere the
&#8217;prayer of quiet,&#8217; is a very different thing, as those will understand who, by
the mercy of God, have experienced them.</p>

<p id="viii.ii-p6">3.
To make the matter clearer, let us imagine we see two fountains with basins
which fill with water. I can find no simile more appropriate than water by
which to explain spiritual things, as I am very ignorant and have poor wits to
help me.<note n="125" id="viii.ii-p6.1"><i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. xix. 5; also St. John
of the Cross, <i>Ascent of Mount Carmel</i>,
bk. ii, ch. xiv, 2, and xxi. 3.</note>&#160; Besides, I love this element so much that I
have studied it more attentively than other things. God, Who is so great, so
wise, has doubtless hidden secrets in all things He created, which we should
greatly benefit by knowing, as those say who understand such matters. Indeed, I
believe that in each smallest creature He has made, though it be but a tiny
ant, there are more wonders than can be comprehended. These two basins are
filled in different ways; the one with water from a distance flowing into it
through many pipes and waterworks, while the other basin is built near the
source of the spring itself and fills quite noiselessly. If the fountain is
plentiful, like the one we speak of, after the basin is full the water
overflows in a great stream which flows continually. No machinery is needed
here, nor does the water run through aqueducts.</p>

<p id="viii.ii-p7">4.
Such is the difference between the two kinds of prayer. The water running
through the aqueducts resembles sensible devotion, which is obtained by
meditation. We gain it by our thoughts, by meditating on created things, and by
the labour of <pb n="100" id="viii.ii-Page_100"/>our
minds; in short, it is the result of our endeavours, and so makes the commotion
I spoke of, while profiting the soul.<note n="126" id="viii.ii-p7.1"><i>Life</i>,
ch. x. 2.</note>&#160; The other fountain, like divine consolations,
receives the water from the source itself, which signifies God: as usual, when
His Majesty wills to bestow on us any supernatural favours, we experience the
greatest peace, calm, and sweetness in the inmost depths of our being; I know
neither where nor how.</p>

<p id="viii.ii-p8">5.
This joy is not, like earthly happiness, at once felt by the heart; after
gradually filling it to the brim, the delight overflows throughout all the
mansions and faculties, until at last it reaches the body. Therefore, I say it
arises from God and ends in ourselves, for whoever experiences it will find
that the whole physical part of our nature shares in this delight and
sweetness. While writing this I have been thinking that the verse &#8216;Dilatasti
cor meum,&#8217; &#8216;Thou hast dilated my heart,&#8217;<note n="127" id="viii.ii-p8.1"><scripRef passage="Ps. cxviii. 32" id="viii.ii-p8.2" parsed="|Ps|118|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.118.32">Ps. cxviii. 32</scripRef>. <i>Life</i>, ch. xvii. 14,</note>&#160; declares that the heart is dilated. This joy
does not appear to me to originate in the heart, but in some more interior part
and, as it were, in the depths of our being. I think this must be the centre of
the soul, as I have since learnt and will explain later on. I discover secrets
within us which often fill me with astonishment: how many more must there be
unknown to me! O my Lord and my God! how stupendous is Thy grandeur! We are
like so many foolish peasant lads: we think we know something of Thee, yet it
must be comparatively nothing, for there are profound secrets even in ourselves
of <pb n="101" id="viii.ii-Page_101"/>which
we know naught. I say &#8216;comparatively nothing&#8217; in proportion with all the
secrets hidden within Thee, yet how great are Thy mysteries that we are
acquainted with and can learn even by the study of such of Thy works as we see!<note n="128" id="viii.ii-p8.3"><i>Life</i>, ch. xiv. 9. <i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xxviii. 11.</note></p>

<p id="viii.ii-p9">6.
To return to the verse I quoted, which may help to explain the dilation begun
by the celestial waters in the depths of our being. They appear to dilate and
enlarge us internally, and benefit us in an inexplicable manner, nor does even
the soul itself understand what it receives. It is conscious of what may be
described as a certain fragrance, as if within its inmost depths were a brazier
sprinkled with sweet perfumes. Although the spirit neither sees the flame nor
knows where it is, yet it is penetrated by the warmth, and scented fumes, which
are even sometimes perceived by the body. Understand me, the soul does not feel
any real heat or scent, but something far more subtle, which I use this
metaphor to explain. Let those who have never experienced it believe that it
really occurs to others: the soul is conscious of it and feels it more distinctly
than can be expressed. It is not a thing we can fancy or gain by anything we
can do; clearly it does not arise from the base coin of human nature, but from
the most pure gold of Divine Wisdom. I believe that in this case the powers of
the soul are not united to God, but are absorbed and astounded at the marvel
before them. I may possibly be contradicting what I wrote elsewhere;<note n="129" id="viii.ii-p9.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xiv. 3: &#8216;The faculties are not
lost, neither are they asleep; the will alone is occupied in such a way that
without knowing how it has become a captive it gives a simple consent to become
the prisoner of God.&#8217; <i>Ibid</i>. &#167; 4: &#8216;The
other two faculties help the will that it may render itself capable of the
fruition of so great a good; nevertheless, it occasionally happens even when
the will is in union that they hinder it very much.&#8217; See also <i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. xxxi. 8.</note>&#160; nor would <pb n="102" id="viii.ii-Page_102"/>this
be surprising, for it was done about fifteen years ago, and perhaps God has
given me since then a clearer insight into the matter. I may be entirely
mistaken on the subject, both then and now, but never do I wilfully say what is
untrue. No; by the mercy of God, I would rather die a thousand times than tell
a falsehood: I speak of the matter as I understand it. I believe that in this
case the will must in some way be united with that of God. The after effects on
the soul, and the subsequent behaviour of the person, show whether this prayer
was genuine or no: this is the best crucible by which to test it.</p>

<p id="viii.ii-p10">7.
Our Lord bestows a signal grace on the soul if it realizes how great is this
favour, and another greater still if it does not turn back on the right road.
You are longing, my daughters, to enter into this state of prayer at once, and
you are right, for, as I said, the soul cannot understand the value of the
graces there bestowed by God upon it, nor the love which draws Him ever closer
to it: we should certainly desire to learn how to obtain this favour. I will
tell you what I know about it, setting aside certain cases in which God bestows
these graces for no other reason than His own choice, into which we have no
right to enquire.</p>

<p id="viii.ii-p11">8.
Practise what I advised in the preceding mansions, then&#8212;humility, humility!
for God lets Himself be vanquished by this and grants us all we ask.<note n="130" id="viii.ii-p11.1"><i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. xvi. i. <i>Life</i>, ch. xxii. 16.</note> <pb n="103" id="viii.ii-Page_103"/> The first proof<note n="131" id="viii.ii-p11.2">Philippus a SS. Trinitate, <i>l.c.</i> art. 3.</note>&#160; that you possess humility is that you neither
think you now deserve these graces and consolations from God, nor that you ever
will as long as you live. You ask me: &#8216;How shall we receive them, if we do not
try to gain them?&#8217; I answer, that there is no surer way to obtain them than the
one I have told you, therefore make no efforts to acquire them, for the
following reasons. The first is, that the chief means of obtaining them is to
love God without self-interest. The second, that it is a slight lack of
humility to think that our wretched services can win so great a reward. The
third, that the real preparation for them is to desire to suffer and imitate
our Lord, rather than to receive consolations, for indeed we have all offended
Him. The fourth reason is, that His Majesty has not promised to give us these
favours in the same way as He has bound Himself to bestow eternal glory on us
if we keep His commandments. We can be saved without these special graces; He
sees better than we do what is best for us and which of us love Him sincerely.
I know for a certain truth, being acquainted with some who walk by the way of
love (and therefore only seek to serve Jesus Christ crucified), that not only
they neither ask for nor desire consolation, but they even beg Him not to give
it them during this life: this is a fact. Fifthly, we should but labour in
vain: this water does not flow through aqueducts, like that we first spoke of,
and if the spring does not afford it, in vain shall we toil to obtain it. I
mean, that though we may meditate and try our hardest, and though we shed <pb n="104" id="viii.ii-Page_104"/>tears
to gain it, we cannot make this water flow. God alone gives it to whom He
chooses, and often when the soul is least thinking of it. We are His, sisters,
let Him do what He will with us, and lead us where He will. If we are really
humble and annihilate ourselves, not only in our imagination (which often
deceives us), but if we truly detach ourselves from all things, our Lord will
not only grant us these favours but many others that we do not know even how to
desire. May He be for ever praised and blessed! Amen.</p>

<p id="viii.iii-p3">1.
THE effects of divine consolations are very numerous: before describing them, I
will speak of another kind of prayer which usually precedes them. I need not
say much on this subject, having written about it elsewhere.<note n="132" id="viii.iii-p3.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xiv. 2. The Saint says in the second chapter of this
mansion, &#167; 5, and also in letters dated Dec. 7, 1577 (Vol. II) and Jan. 14,
1580, that when writing the <i>Interior
Castle</i> she had more experience in spiritual things than when she composed
her former works. This is fully borne out by the present chapter. In the
corresponding part of her <i>Life</i> she
practically confounded the prayer of recollection with the prayer of quiet (the
second state of the soul). Likewise, in the <i>Way
of Perfection</i>, ch. xxviii., she speaks of but one kind of prayer of
recollection and then passes on to the prayer of quiet. Here, however, she
mentions a second form of the prayer of recollection. See Philippus a SS.
Trinitate, pars iii. tract. i, disc. iii. art. 1, &#8216;De oratione recollectionis&#8217;
(page 81 of the third vol. of the edition of 1874); &#8216;de secundo modo
recollectionis&#8217; (<i>ibid</i>. p. 82.); and
art. 2: &#8216;De oratione quietis&#8217; (<i>ibid</i>.
p. 84.) Antonius a Spiritu Sancto, <i>Direct.
Mystic.</i> tract. iv. n. 78: &#8216;Duo sunt hujus recollectionis modi, primus quidem
activus [reference to the <i>Way of
Perfection</i>, <i>l.c.</i>], secundus autem
passivus, [reference to this chapter of the Fourth Mansion].&#8217; The former is not
supernatural, in the sense that with special grace from above it can be
acquired; the second is altogether supernatural and more like gratuitous grace
(<i>ibid</i>. no. 80 and 81). On the meaning
of &#8216;Solitude,&#8217; &#8216;Silence,&#8217; etc., see Anton. a Sp. S. <i>l.c.</i>, tract. i, n. 78-82.</note>&#160; This
is a kind of recollection which, I believe, is supernatural. There is <pb n="105" id="viii.iii-Page_105"/>no
occasion to retire nor to shut the eyes, nor does it depend on anything
exterior; involuntarily the eyes suddenly close and solitude is found. Without
any labour of one&#8217;s own, the temple of which I spoke is reared for the soul in
which to pray: the senses and exterior surroundings appear to lose their hold,
while the spirit gradually regains its lost sovereignty. Some say the soul
enters into itself; others, that it rises above itself.<note n="133" id="viii.iii-p3.2">The edition of Burgos (vol.
iv, P. 59) refers appropriately to the following passage in the <i>Tercer Abecedario</i> (See <i>Life</i>, ch. iv, 8) by the Franciscan friar
Francisco de Osuna, a work which exercised a profound influence on St. Teresa:
&#8217;Entering within oneself; and rising above oneself, are the two principal
points in this exercise, those which, above all others, one ought to strive
after, and which give the highest satisfaction to the soul. There is less
labour in entering within oneself than in rising above oneself and therefore it
appears to me that when the soul is ready and fit for either, you ought to do
the former, because the other will follow without any effort, and will be all
the more pure and spiritual; however, follow what course your soul prefers as
this will bring you more grace and benefit,&#8217; (Tr. ix, ch, viii).</note>&#160; I can say nothing about these terms, but had
better speak of the subject as I understand it. You will probably grasp my <pb n="106" id="viii.iii-Page_106"/>meaning,
although, perhaps, I may be the only person who understands it. Let us imagine
that the senses and powers of the soul (which I compared in my allegory to the
inhabitants of the castle) have fled and joined the enemy outside. After long
days and years of absence, perceiving how great has been their loss, they
return to the neighbourhood of the castle, but cannot manage to re-enter it,
for their evil habits are hard to break off; still, they are no longer
traitors, and they wander about outside.</p>

<p id="viii.iii-p4">2.
The King, Who holds His court within it, sees their good will, and out of His
great mercy desires them to return to Him. Like a good Shepherd, He plays so
sweetly on His pipe, that although scarcely hearing it they recognize His call
and no longer wander, but return, like lost sheep, to the mansions. So strong
is this Pastor&#8217;s power over His flock, that they abandon the worldly cares
which misled them and re-enter the castle.</p>

<p id="viii.iii-p5">3.
I think I never put this matter so clearly before. To seek God within ourselves
avails us far more than to look for Him amongst creatures; Saint Augustine
tells us how he found the Almighty within his own soul, after having long
sought for Him elsewhere.<note n="134" id="viii.iii-p5.1">Some
editors of the <i>Interior Castle</i> think
that St. Teresa refers to the following passage taken from the <i>Confessions</i> of St. Augustine: &#8216;Too late
have I loved Thee, O Beauty, ever ancient yet ever new! too late have I loved
Thee! And behold, Thou wert within me and I abroad, and there I searched for
Thee, and, deformed as I was, I pursued the beauties that Thou hast made. Thou
wert with me, but I was not with Thee. Those things kept me far from Thee, which,
unless they were in Thee, could have had no being&#8217; (<i>St. Augustine&#8217;s Confessions</i>, bk. x, ch. xxvii.). The <i>Confessions of St. Augustine</i> were first
translated into Spanish by Sebastian Toscano, a Portuguese Augustinian. This
edition, which was published at Salamanca in 1554, was the one used by St.
Teresa. However, it is more probable that here and elsewhere (Life, ch. xli.
10; <i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xxviii. 2) St.
Teresa quotes a passage which occurs in a pious book entitled <i>Soliloquia</i>, and erroneously attributed
to St. Augustine: &#8216;I have gone about the streets and the broad ways of the city
of this world seeking Thee, but have not found Thee for I was wrong in seeking
without for what was within.&#8217; (ch. xxxi.) This treatise which is also quoted by
St. John of the Cross, <i>Spiritual Canticle</i>,
stanza i. 7, <i>Ascent of Mount Carmel</i>,
bk. i. ch. v. 1, appeared in a Spanish translation at Valladolid in 1515, at
Medina del Campo in 1553, and at Toledo in 1565.</note>&#160; This recollection helps us greatly <pb n="107" id="viii.iii-Page_107"/>when
God bestows it upon us. But do not fancy you can gain it by thinking of God
dwelling within you, or by imagining Him as present in your soul: this is a
good practice and an excellent kind of meditation, for it is founded on the
fact that God resides within us;<note n="135" id="viii.iii-p5.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. xiv. 7, 8; 20.</note>&#160; it is not, however, the prayer of
recollection, for by the divine assistance every one can practise it, but what
I mean is quite a different thing. Sometimes, before they have begun to think
of God, the powers of the soul find themselves within the castle. I know not by
what means they entered, nor how they heard the Shepherd&#8217;s pipe; the ears
perceived no sound but the soul is keenly conscious of a delicious sense of
recollection experienced by those who enjoy this favour, which I cannot
describe more clearly.</p>

<p id="viii.iii-p6">4.
I think I read somewhere<note n="136" id="viii.iii-p6.1">St.
Teresa read this in the <i>Tercer Abecedario</i>
of Francisco de Osuna (tr. vi, ch, iv): &#8216;This exercise concentrates the senses
of man in the interior of the heart where dwells &#8216;the daughter of the king&#8217;;
that is, the Catholic soul; thus recollected, man may well be compared to the
tortoise or sea-urchin which rolls itself up and withdraws within itself,
disregarding everything outside.&#8217;</note>&#160; that the soul is then 
like a tortoise or sea-urchin, which retreats into itself. <pb n="108" id="viii.iii-Page_108"/>
Those who said this no doubt understood what they were talking about; but these
creatures can withdraw into themselves at will, while here it is not in our
power to retire into ourselves, unless God gives us the grace. In my opinion,
His Majesty only bestows this favour on those who have renounced the world, in <i>desire</i> at least, if their state of life
does not permit their doing so in <i>fact</i>.
He thus specially calls them to devote themselves to spiritual things; if they
allow Him power to at freely He will bestow still greater graces on those whom
He thus begins calling to a higher life. Those who enjoy this recollection
should thank God fervently: it is of the highest importance for them to realize
the value of this favour, gratitude for which would prepare them to receive
still more signal graces. Some books advise that as a preparation for hearing
what our Lord may say to us we should keep our minds at rest, waiting to see
what He will work in our souls.<note n="137" id="viii.iii-p6.2"><i>Life</i>. ch, xii. 8.</note>&#160; But unless His Majesty has begun to suspend
our faculties, I cannot understand how we are to stop thinking, without doing
ourselves more harm than good. This point has been much debated by those
learned in spiritual matters; I confess my want of humility in having been
unable to yield to their opinion.<note n="138" id="viii.iii-p6.3"><i>Life</i>, ch. xiv, 10.</note></p>

<p id="viii.iii-p7">5.
Some one told me of a certain book written on the subject by the saintly Friar
Peter of Alcantara (as I think I may justly call him); I should have submitted
to his decision, knowing that he was competent to judge, but on reading it I
found he <pb n="109" id="viii.iii-Page_109"/>agreed
with me that the mind must act until called to recollection by love, although
he stated it in other words.<note n="139" id="viii.iii-p7.1"><p id="viii.iii-p8"><i>A Golden Treatise of Mental Prayer</i> by
St. Peter of Alcantara, translated by Rev. G. F. Bullock M.A. and edited by
Rev. George Seymour Hollings S.S.J.E. London, Mowbray, 1905, p. 117.</p>

<p id="viii.iii-p9">Eighth
Counsel. Let the last and chiefest counsel be that in this holy exercise we
should endeavour to unite Meditation with Contemplation making of the one a
ladder for attaining to the other. For this we must know that (p. 118) the very
office of Meditation is to consider Divine things with studiousness and
attention passing from one to another, to move our hearts to some affection and
deep feeling for them, which is as though one should strike a flint to draw
from it the spark.</p>

<p id="viii.iii-p10">For
Contemplation is to have drawn forth this spark: I mean to have now found this
affection and feeling which were sought for, and to be in peace and silence
enjoying them; not with many discursive and intellectual speculations but with
simple gaze upon the truth.</p>

<p id="viii.iii-p11">Wherefore,
says a holy teacher, Meditation goes its way and brings forth fruit, with
labour, but Contemplation bears fruit without labour. The one seeketh, the
other findeth; the one consumeth the food, the other enjoys it; the one
discourseth, and maketh reflections, the other is contented with a simple gaze
upon the things, for it hath in possession their love and joy. Lastly, the one
is as the means, the other as the end; the one as the road and journeying along
it, the other as the end of the road and of the journeying.</p>

<p id="viii.iii-p12">From
this is to be inferred a very common thing, which all masters of the spiritual
life teach, although it is little (p. 119) understood of those who learn it;
which is this, that, as the means cease when the end has been attained, as the
voyaging is over when the port has been touched, so when, through the working
out of our Meditation, we have come to the repose and sweet savour of
Contemplation, we ought then to cease from that pious and laborious searching;
and being satisfied with the simple gaze upon, and thought of, God&#8212;as though
we had Him there present before us&#8212;we should rest in the enjoyment of that affection
then given, whether it be of love, or of admiration, or joy, or other like
sentiment.</p>

<p id="viii.iii-p13">The
reason why this counsel is given is this, that as the aim of this devotion is
love and the affections of the will rather than the speculations of the
understanding, when the will has been caught and taken by this affection, we
should put away all those discursive and intellectual speculations, so far as
we can, in order that our soul with all its forces may be fastened upon this
affection without being diverted by the action of other influences. A learned
teacher, therefore, counsels us that as soon as anyone feels himself fired by
the love of God, he should first put aside (p. 120.) all these considerations
and thoughts&#8212;however exalted they may seem&#8212;not because they are really not
good in themselves, but because they are then hindrances to what is better. and
more important. For this is nothing else than that, having come to the end and
purpose of our work, we should stay therein, and leave Meditation for the love
of Contemplation. This may especially be done at the end of any exercise, that
is, after the petition for the Divine love of which we have spoken, for one
reason, because then it is supposed that the labour of the exercise we have
just gone through has produced some divine devotion and feeling, since, saith
the wise man, &#8216;Better is the end of prayer than the beginning&#8217;: and for another
reason, that, after the work of Prayer and Meditation, it is well that one
should give his mind a little rest, and allow it to repose in the arms of
Contemplation. At this point, then, we should put away all other thoughts that
may present themselves, and, quieting the mind and stilling the memory, fix all
upon our Lord; and remembering that we are then in His presence, no longer
dwell upon the details of divine things.</p>

<p id="viii.iii-p14"><i>Ibidem</i> p. 121. And not only at the end
of the exercise but in the midst of it, and at whatever part of it, this
spiritual swoon should come upon us, when the intellect is laid to sleep, we
should make this pause, and enjoy the blessing bestowed; and then, when we have
finished the digestion of it, turn to the matter we have in hand, as the
gardener does, when he waters his garden-bed; who, after giving it (p. 122) a
sufficiency of water, holds back the stream, and lets it soak and spread itself
through the depths of the earth; and then when this hath somewhat dried up, he
turns down upon it again the flow of water that it may receive still more, and
be well irrigated.&#8217;</p></note>&#160; Possibly I may be mistaken, but I rely on
these reasons. Firstly, he who reasons less and tries to do least, does most in
spiritual matters. We <pb n="110" id="viii.iii-Page_110"/>should
make our petitions like beggars before a powerful and rich Emperor; then, with
downcast eyes, humbly wait. When He secretly shows us He hears our prayers, it
is well to be silent, as He has drawn us into His presence; there would then be
no harm in trying to keep our minds at rest (that is to say, if we can). If,
however, the King makes no sign of listening or of seeing us, there is no need
to stand inert, like a dolt, which the soul would <pb n="111" id="viii.iii-Page_111"/>resemble
if it continued inactive. In this case its dryness would greatly increase, and
the imagination would be made more restless than before by its very effort to
think of nothing. Our Lord wishes us at such a time to offer Him our petitions
and to place ourselves in His presence; He knows what is best for us.</p>

<p id="viii.iii-p15">6.
I believe that human efforts avail nothing in these matters, which His Majesty
appears to reserve to Himself, setting this limit to our powers. In many other
things, such as penances, good works, and prayers, with His aid we can help
ourselves as far as human weakness will allow. The second reason is, that these
interior operations being sweet and peaceful,<note n="140" id="viii.iii-p15.1"><i>Sap</i>. viii. i: &#8216;Disponit omnia suaviter.&#8217;</note>&#160; any painful effort does us more harm than
good. By &#8216;painful effort&#8217; I mean any forcible restraint we place on ourselves,
such as holding our breath.<note n="141" id="viii.iii-p15.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. xv. i.</note>&#160; We should rather abandon our souls into the
hands of God, leaving Him to do as He chooses with us, as far as possible
forgetting all self-interest and resigning ourselves entirely to His will. The
third reason is, that the very effort to think of nothing excites our
imagination the more. The fourth is, because we render God the most true and
acceptable service by caring only for His honour and glory and forgetting
ourselves, our advantages, comfort and happiness. How can we be self-oblivious,
while keeping ourselves under such strict control that we are afraid to move,
or even to think, or to leave our minds enough liberty to desire God&#8217;s greater
glory and to rejoice in the <pb n="112" id="viii.iii-Page_112"/>glory
which He possesses? When His Majesty wishes the mind to rest from working He
employs it in another manner, giving it a light and knowledge far above any
obtainable by its own efforts and absorbing it entirely into Himself. Then,
though it knows not how, it is filled with wisdom such as it could never gain
for itself by striving to suspend the thoughts. God gave us faculties for our use;
each of them will receive its proper reward. Then do not let us try to charm
them to sleep, but permit them to do their work until divinely called to
something higher.<note n="142" id="viii.iii-p15.3">&#8217;The
whole of the time in which our Lord communicates the simple, loving general
attention of which I made mention before, or when the soul, assisted by grace,
is established in that state, we must contrive to keep the understanding in
repose, undisturbed by the intrusion of forms, figures, or particular
knowledge, unless it were slightly and for an instant, and that with sweetness
of love, to enkindle our souls the more. At other times, however, in all our
acts of devotion and good works, we must make use of good recollections and
meditations, so that we may feel an increase of profit and devotion; most
especially applying ourselves to the life, passion, and death of Jesus Christ,
our Lord, that our life and conduct may be an imitation of His.&#8217; (St. John of
the Cross, <i>Ascent of Mount Carmel</i>,
bk. ii. ch. xxxii. 7.)</note>
</p>

<p id="viii.iii-p16">7.
In my opinion, when God chooses to place the soul in this mansion it is best
for it to do as I advised, and then endeavour, without force or disturbance, to
keep free from wandering thoughts. No effort, however, should be made to
suspend the imagination entirely from arming, for it is well to remember God&#8217;s
presence and to consider Who He is. If transported out of itself by its
feelings, well and good; but let it not try to understand what is passing
within it, for this favour is bestowed on the will which should be left to
enjoy it in peace, <pb n="113" id="viii.iii-Page_113"/>only
making loving aspirations occasionally. Although, in this kind of prayer, the
soul makes no effort towards it, yet often, for a very short time, the mind
ceases to think at all. I explained elsewhere why this occurs during this
spiritual state.<note n="143" id="viii.iii-p16.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xv. 2.</note>&#160; On first speaking of the fourth mansions, I
told you I had mentioned divine consolations before the prayer of recollection.
The latter should have come first, as it is far inferior to consolations, of
which it is the commencement. Recollection does not require us to give up
meditation, nor to cease using our intellect. In the prayer of quiet, when the
water flows from the spring itself and not through conduits, the mind ceases to
act; it is forced to do so, although it does not understand what is happening,
and so wanders hither and thither in bewilderment, finding no place for rest.
Meanwhile the will, entirely united to. God, is much disturbed by the tumult of
the thoughts: no notice, however, should be taken of them, or they would cause
the loss of a great part of the favour the soul is enjoying. Let the spirit
ignore these distractions and abandon itself in the arms of divine love: His
Majesty will teach it how best to act, which chiefly consists in its
recognizing its unworthiness of so great a good and occupying itself in
thanking Him for it.</p>

<p id="viii.iii-p17">8.
In order to treat of the prayer of recollection, I passed over in silence the
effects and symptoms to be found in souls thus favoured by God. Divine consolations
evidently cause a dilation or enlargement of the soul that may be compared to
water <pb n="114" id="viii.iii-Page_114"/>flowing
from a spring into a basin which has no outlet, but is so constructed as to
increase in size and proportion to the quantity poured into it. God seems to
work the same effect by this prayer, besides giving many other marvellous
graces, so preparing and disposing the soul to contain all He intends to give
it. After interior sweetness and dilation the soul is not so restrained as
formerly in God&#8217;s service, but possesses much more liberty of spirit. It is no
longer distressed by the terror of hell, for though more anxious than ever not
to offend God, it has lost servile fear and feels sure that one day it will
possess its Lord. It does not dread the loss of health by austerities;<note n="144" id="viii.iii-p17.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxiv. 2.</note>&#160; believing that there is nothing it could not
do by His grace, it is more desirous than before of doing penance. Greater
indifference is felt for sufferings because faith being stronger, it trusts
that if borne for God He will give the grace to endure them patiently. Indeed,
such a one at times even longs for trials, having a most ardent desire to do
something for His sake. As the soul better understands the Divine Majesty, it
realizes more vividly its own baseness. Divine consolation shows it how vile
are earthly pleasures; by gradually withdrawing from them, it gains greater
self-mastery. In short, its virtues are increased and it will not cease to
advance in perfection, unless it turns back and offends God. Should it act
thus, it would lose everything, however high the state it may have reached.</p>

<p id="viii.iii-p18">9.
It is not to be supposed that all these effects are produced merely by God&#8217;s
having shown these <pb n="115" id="viii.iii-Page_115"/>favours
once or twice. They must be received continually, for it is on their frequent
reception that the whole welfare of the soul depends. I strongly urge those who
have reached this state to avoid most carefully all occasions of offending God.<note n="145" id="viii.iii-p18.1"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xvi. 5. <i>Castle</i>, M. v. ch. i, 2, 3; ii. 4, 5; iii.
2, 6, 12.</note>&#160; The soul is not yet fully established in
virtue, but is like a new-born babe first feeding at its mother&#8217;s breast:<note n="146" id="viii.iii-p18.2"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xxxi. 7. <i>Concept</i>. ch. iv. 6.</note>&#160; if it leaves her, what can it do but die? I
greatly fear that when a soul to whom God has granted this favour discontinues
prayer, except under urgent necessity, it will, unless it returns to the
practice at once, go from bad to worse.</p>

<p id="viii.iii-p19">10.
I realize the danger of such a case, having had the grief of witnessing the fall
of persons I knew through their withdrawal from Him Who sought, with so much
love, to make Himself their friend, as He proved by His treatment of them. I
urgently warn such persons not to run the risk of sinning, for the devil would
rather gain one of these souls than many to whom our Lord does not grant such
graces,<note n="147" id="viii.iii-p19.1"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xl. 3.</note>&#160; as the former may cause him severe loss by
leading others to follow their example, and may even render great service to
the Church of God. Were there no other reason except that he saw the special
love His Majesty bears these people, it would suffice to make Satan frantic to
destroy God&#8217;s work in them, so that they might be lost eternally. Therefore
they suffer grievous temptations, and if they fall, they fall lower than
others.</p>

<pb n="116" id="viii.iii-Page_116"/>
<p id="viii.iii-p20">11. You, my sisters, are free from such dangers, as far as we can 
tell: God keep
you from pride and vainglory! The devil sometimes offers counterfeits of the
graces I have mentioned: this can easily be detected&#8212;the effects being exactly
contrary to those of the genuine ones.<note n="148" id="viii.iii-p20.1"><i>Life</i>,
ch. xx. 31.</note>&#160; Although I have spoken of it elsewhere,<note n="149" id="viii.iii-p20.2"><i>Found</i>. ch. vi.</note>&#160; I wish to warn you here of a special danger
to which those who practise prayer are subject, particularly women, whose
weakness of constitution makes them more liable to such mistakes. On account of
their penances, prayers, and vigils, or even merely because of debility of
health, some persons cannot receive spiritual consolation without being
overcome by it. On feeling any interior joy, their bodies being languid and
weak, they fall into a slumber&#8212;they call it spiritual sleep&#8212;which is a more
advanced stage of what I have described; they think the soul shares in it as
well as the body, and abandon themselves to a sort of intoxication. The more
they lose self-control, the more do their feelings get possession of them,
because the frame becomes more feeble. They fancy this is a trance and call it
one, but I call it nonsense; it does nothing but waste their time and injure
their health.</p>

<p id="viii.iii-p21">12.
This state lasted with a certain person for eight hours, during which time she
was neither insensible, nor had she any thought of God.<note n="150" id="viii.iii-p21.1"><i>Found</i>. ch. vi. 15.</note>&#160; She was cured by being made to eat and sleep
well and to leave off some of her penances. Her recovery <pb n="117" id="viii.iii-Page_117"/>was
owing to some one who understood her case; hitherto she had unintentionally
deceived both her confessor and other people, as well as herself. I feel quite
sure the devil had been at work here to serve his own ends and he was beginning
to gain a great deal from it. It should be known that when God bestows such
favours on the soul, although there may be languor both of mind and body, it is
not shared by the soul, which feels great delight at seeing itself so near God,
nor does this state ever continue for more than a very short time.<note n="151" id="viii.iii-p21.2"><i>Life</i> ch. xviii. 16, 17.</note>&#160; Although the soul may become absorbed again,
yet, as I said, unless already feeble, the body suffers neither exhaustion nor
pain. I advise any of you who experience the latter to tell the Prioress, and
to divert your thoughts as much as possible from such matters. The Superior
should prevent such a nun from spending more than a very few hours in prayer,
and should make her eat and sleep well until her usual strength is restored, if
she has lost it in this way.<note n="152" id="viii.iii-p21.3"><i>Letter</i> of Oct. 23, 1 376. Vol. II.</note>&#160; If the nun&#8217;s constitution is so delicate that
this does not suffice, let her believe me when I tell her that God only calls
her to the active life. There must be such people in monasteries: employ her in
the various offices and be careful that she is never left very long alone,
otherwise she will entirely lose her health. This treatment will be a great
mortification to her: our Lord tests her love for Him by the way in which she
bears His absence. He may be pleased, after a time, to restore her strength; if
not, she will make as <pb n="118" id="viii.iii-Page_118"/>much
progress, and earn as great a reward by vocal prayer and obedience as she would
have done by contemplation, and perhaps more.</p>

<p id="viii.iii-p22">13.
There are people, some of whom I have known, whose minds and imaginations are
so active as to fancy they see whatever they think about, which is very
dangerous.<note n="153" id="viii.iii-p22.1"><i>Found</i>. ch. viii. 7-8.</note>&#160; Perhaps I may treat of this later on, but
cannot do so now. I have dwelt at length on this mansion, as I believe it to be
the one most souls enter. As the natural is combined with the supernatural, the
devil can do more harm here than later on, when God does not leave him so many
opportunities. May God be for ever praised! Amen.</p>

<p id="ix.i-p3">1.
OH, my sisters, how shall I describe the riches, treasures, and joys contained
in the fifth mansions! Would it not be better to say nothing about them? They
are impossible to depict, nor can the mind conceive, nor any comparisons
portray them, all earthly things being too vile to serve the purpose. Send me,
O my Lord, light from heaven that I may give some to these Thy servants, some
of whom by Thy good will often enjoy these delights, lest the devil in the
guise of an angel of light should deceive those whose only desire is to please
Thee.</p>

<p id="ix.i-p4">2.
I said &#8216;some,&#8217; but in reality there are very <i>few</i><note n="154" id="ix.i-p4.1"><i>Found</i>. ch. iv. 8.</note>&#160; who never enter this mansion: some more and
some less, but most of them may be said at least <pb n="120" id="ix.i-Page_120"/>to
gain admittance into these rooms. I think that certain graces I am about to
describe are bestowed on only a few of the nuns, but if the rest only arrive at
the portal they receive a great boon from God, for &#8216;many are called, but few
are chosen.&#8217;<note n="155" id="ix.i-p4.2">St.
<scripRef passage="Matt. xx. 16" id="ix.i-p4.3" parsed="|Matt|20|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.20.16">Matt. xx. 16</scripRef>: &#8216;Multi enim sunt vocati, pauci vero electi.&#8217;</note>&#160; All we who wear the holy habit of the
Carmelites are called to prayer and contemplation. This was the object of our
Order,<note n="156" id="ix.i-p4.4">Maneant
singuli in cellulis suis, vel juxta eas, die ac nocte in lege Domini meditantes
et in orationibus vigilantes.&#8217; (<i>Carmelite
Rule</i>).</note>&#160; to this lineage we belong. Our holy Fathers
of Mount Carmel sought in perfect solitude and utter contempt of the world for
this treasure, this precious pearl,<note n="157" id="ix.i-p4.5">St.
Matt, xiii. 46.</note>&#160; of which we speak, and we are their
descendants. How little do most of us care to prepare our souls, that our Lord
may reveal this jewel to us! Outwardly we may appear to practise the requisite
virtues, but we have far more to do than this before it is possible to attain
to contemplation, to gain which we should neglect no means, either small or
great. Rouse yourselves, my sisters, and since some foretaste of heaven may be
had on earth, beg our Lord to give us grace not to miss it through our own
fault. Ask Him to show us where to find it&#8212;ask Him to give us strength of soul
to dig until we find this hidden treasure, which lies buried within our hearts,
as I wish to show you if it please God to enable me. I said &#8216;strength of <i>soul</i>,&#8217; that you might understand that
strength of <i>body</i> is not indispensable
when our Lord God chooses to withhold it. He makes it impossible for no one to
gain these riches, <pb n="121" id="ix.i-Page_121"/>but
is content that each should do his best. Blessed be so just a God!</p>

<p id="ix.i-p5">3.
But, daughters, if you would purchase this treasure of which we are speaking,
God would have you keep back nothing from Him, little or great. He will have it
all;<note n="158" id="ix.i-p5.1">&#8217;The
reason why there are so few contemplatives is that there are so few persons who
wholly withdraw themselves from transitory and created things&#8217; (<i>Imitation</i>, bk. iii. ch. xxxi. 1). See
also <i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. xvi. 5. <i>Life</i>, ch.
xi. 2-4; xxii. 18, 19.</note>&#160; in proportion to what you know you have given
will your reward be great or small. There is no more certain sign whether or
not we have reached the prayer of union. Do not imagine that this state of
prayer is, like the one preceding it, a sort of drowsiness (I call it
&#8217;drowsiness&#8217; because the soul seems to slumber, being neither quite asleep nor
wholly awake). In the prayer of union the soul is asleep, fast asleep, as
regards the world and itself: in fact, during the short time this state lasts
it is deprived of all feeling whatever, being unable to think on any subject,
even if it wished. No effort is needed here to suspend the thoughts: if the
soul can love it knows not how, nor whom it loves, nor what it desires. In
fact, it has died entirely to this world, to live more truly than ever in God.
This is a delicious death, for the soul is deprived of the faculties it
exercised while in the body:<note n="159" id="ix.i-p5.2"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xxv. 1. <i>Life</i>, ch. xvi. <i>Rel</i>. I. i; viii. 7.</note>&#160; delicious because, (although not really the
case), it seems to have left its mortal covering to abide more entirely in God.
So completely does this take place, that I know not whether the body retains
sufficient life to continue breathing; on <pb n="122" id="ix.i-Page_122"/>consideration,
I believe it does not; at any rate, if it still breathes, it does so
unconsciously.</p>

<p id="ix.i-p6">4.
The mind entirely concentrates itself on trying to understand what is
happening, which is beyond its power; it is so astounded that, if consciousness
is not completely lost, at least no movement is possible: the person may be
compared to one who falls into a dead faint with dismay.<note n="160" id="ix.i-p6.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xvii. 2.</note>
</p>

<p id="ix.i-p7">5.
Oh, mighty secrets of God! Never should I weary of trying to explain them if I
thought it possible to succeed! I would write a thousand foolish things that
one might be to the point, if only it might make us praise God more. I said
this prayer produced no drowsiness in the mind; on the other hand, in the
prayer (of quiet) described in the last mansion, until the soul has gained much
experience it doubts what really happened to it. &#8216;Was it nothing but fancy, or
was it a sleep? Did it come from God or from the devil, disguised as an angel
of light?&#8217; The mind feels a thousand misgivings, and well for it that it
should, because, at I said, nature may sometimes deceive us in this case.
Although there is little chance of the poisonous reptiles entering here, yet
agile little lizards will try to slip in, though they can do no harm,
especially if they remain unnoticed. These, as I said, are trivial fancies of
the imagination, which are often very troublesome. However active these small
lizards may be, they cannot enter the fifth mansion, for neither the
imagination, the understanding, nor the memory has power to hinder the graces
bestowed on it. <pb n="123" id="ix.i-Page_123"/>6.
I dare venture to assert that, if this is genuine union with God, the devil
cannot interfere nor do any harm, for His Majesty is so joined and united with
the essence of the soul, that the evil one dare not approach, nor can he even
understand this mystery. This is certain, for it is said that the devil does
not know our thoughts, much less can he penetrate a secret so profound that God
does not reveal it even to us.<note n="161" id="ix.i-p7.1">According
to St. Thomas, angels&#8212;whether good or bad&#8212;do not know the thoughts of man
unless they become manifest by some exterior sign. S. Theol. I. q. lvii. art.
4. See also St. John of the Cross, <i>Dark
Night</i>, bk. II, ch. xxiii. 2, 5.</note>&#160; Oh, blessed state, in which this cursed one
cannot injure us! What riches we receive while God so works in us that neither
we ourselves nor any one else can impede Him! What will He not bestow, Who is
so eager to give, and Who can give us all He desires! You may perhaps have been
puzzled at my saying &#8216;if this is genuine union with God,&#8217; as if there might be
other unions. There are indeed&#8212;not with God, but with vanities&#8212;when the devil
transports the soul passionately addicted to them, but the union differs from
that which is divine and the mind misses the delight and satisfaction, peace
and happiness of divine union. These heavenly consolations are above all
earthly joys, pleasure, and satisfaction. As great a difference exists between
their origin and that of worldly pleasures as between their opposite effects,
as you know by experience.</p>

<p id="ix.i-p8">7.
I said somewhere<note n="162" id="ix.i-p8.1">Mansion
iv. ch. i, 5.</note>&#160; that the one seems only to touch the surface
of the body, while the other penetrates to the very marrow: I believe this is 
<pb n="124" id="ix.i-Page_124"/>correct,
and I cannot express myself better. I fancy that you are not yet satisfied on
this question, but are afraid of deception, for spiritual matters are very hard
to explain. Enough, however, has been said for those who have received this
grace, as the difference between divine union and any other is very striking.
However, I will give you a clear proof which cannot mislead you, nor leave any
doubt whether the favour comes from God or no. His Majesty brought it back to
my memory this very day; it appears to me to be an unmistakable sign. In
difficult questions, although I think I understand them and am speaking the
truth, I always say &#8216;it appears to me&#8217;; for, in case my opinion is wrong, I am
most willing to submit to the judgment of theologians. Although they may not
have had personal experience in such matters, yet in some way I do not
understand, God Who sets them to give light to His Church enables them to
recognize the truth when it is put before them. If they are not thoughtless and
indevout, but servants of God, they are never dismayed at His mighty works,
knowing perfectly well that it is in His power to perform far greater wonders.
If some of the marvels told are new to them, yet they have read of others of
the same kind, showing the former to be possible. I have had great experience
as to this and have also met with timid, half-instructed people whose ignorance
has cost me very dear.<note n="163" id="ix.i-p8.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. viii. 15.</note>&#160; I am convinced that those who refuse to
believe that God can do far more than this, and that He is pleased now, as in
the past, to communicate <pb n="125" id="ix.i-Page_125"/>
Himself to His creatures, shut fast their hearts against receiving such favours
themselves. Do not imitate them, sisters: be convinced that it is possible for
God to perform still greater wonders. Do not concern yourselves as to whether
those who receive these graces are good or wicked; as I said, He knows best and
it is no business of yours: you should serve Him with a single heart and with
humility, and should praise Him for His works and wonders.<note n="164" id="ix.i-p8.3"><i>Life</i>, ch. xviii. 16.</note>
</p>

<p id="ix.i-p9">8.
Let us now speak of the sign which proves the prayer of union to have been
genuine. As you have seen, God then deprives the soul of all its senses that He
may the better imprint in it true wisdom: it neither sees, hears, nor
understands anything while this state lasts, which is never more than a very
brief time;<note n="165" id="ix.i-p9.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xx. 13, 24.</note>&#160; it appears to the soul to be much shorter
than it really is. God visits the soul in a manner which prevents its doubting,
on returning to itself, that it dwelt in Him and that He was within it, and so
firmly is it convinced of this truth that, although years may pass before this
favour recurs, the soul can never forget it nor doubt the fact,<note n="166" id="ix.i-p9.2">Philippus a SS. Trinitate, <i>l.c.</i>, pars iii. tr. i. disc. iv. art, 2,
where he adds some further signs. Anton. a Sp. S., <i>l.c.</i>, tract. i. no. 116 and 117.</note>&#160; setting aside the effects left by this
prayer, to which I will refer later on. The conviction felt by the soul is the
main point.</p>

<p id="ix.i-p10">9.
But, you may ask, how can a person who is incapable of sight and hearing see<note n="167" id="ix.i-p10.1">&#8217;The soul
does not see the good Master who teaches it, although clearly conscious of His
presence.&#8217; (<i>Concept</i>. ch. iv. 3.)</note> or know
these <pb n="126" id="ix.i-Page_126"/>things?
I do not say that she saw it at the time, but that she perceives it clearly
afterwards, not by any vision but by a certitude which remains in the heart
which God alone could give. I know of some one who was unaware of God&#8217;s being
in all things by presence, power and essence, yet was firmly convinced of it by
a divine favour of this sort.<note n="168" id="ix.i-p10.2"><p id="ix.i-p11">&#8217;There
are three ways in which God is present in the soul. The first is His presence
in essence, not in holy souls only, but in wretched and sinful souls as well,
and also in all created things; for it is by this presence that He gives life
and being, and were it withdrawn at once all things would return to nothing.
This presence never fails in the soul. The second is His presence by grace,
whereby He dwells in the soul, pleased and satisfied with it. This presence is
not in all souls; for those who fall into mortal sin lose it, and no soul can
know in a natural way whether it has it or not. The third is His presence by
spiritual affection. God is wont to show His presence in many devout souls in
divers ways, in refreshment, joy and gladness.&#8217; (St. John of the Cross, <i>Spiritual Canticle</i>, stanza xi. 2.)</p>

<p id="ix.i-p12">&#8217;In
every soul, even that of the greatest sinner in the world, God dwells and is
substantially present. This way of union or presence of God, in the order of
nature, subsists between Him and all His creatures; by this He preserves them
in being, and if He withdraws it they immediately perish and cease to be. And
so, when I speak of the union of the soul with God, I do not mean this
substantial presence which is in every creature, but that union and
transformation of the soul in God by love which is only then accomplished when
there subsists the likeness which love begets.&#8217; (St. John of the Cross, <i>Ascent</i>, bk. ii. ch. v. 3.)</p>

<p id="ix.i-p13">Fr.
Gracian, <i>Peregrinacion de Anastasio</i>
(Burgos, 1905), p. 171.</p></note>
She asked an ill-instructed priest of the
kind I mentioned to tell her in what way God dwelt within us: he was as
ignorant on the subject as she had been before our Lord revealed to her the
truth, and answered that the Almighty was only present in us by grace.<note n="169" id="ix.i-p13.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xviii. 20. <i>Rel</i>. ix. 17; xi. 8. St. Teresa was so
deeply impressed by the ignorance of this priest that she very frequently
referred to it.</note>&#160; Yet so strong was her <pb n="127" id="ix.i-Page_127"/>conviction
of the truth learnt during her prayer that she did not believe him and
questioned other spiritual persons on the subject, who confirmed her in the
true doctrine, much to her joy. Do not mistake and imagine that this certainty
of God&#8217;s having visited the soul concerns any corporal presence such as that of
our Lord Jesus Christ Who dwells in the Blessed Sacrament, although we do not
see Him: it relates solely to the Divinity. If we did not see it, how can we
feel so sure of it? That I do not know: it is the work of the Almighty and I am
certain that what I say is the fact. I maintain that a soul which does not feel
this assurance has not been united to God entirely, but only by one of its
powers, or has received one of the many other favours God is accustomed to
bestow on men. In all such matters we must not seek to know how things
happened: our understanding could not grasp them, therefore why trouble
ourselves on the subject? It is enough to know that it is He, the all-powerful
God, Who has performed the work. We can do nothing on our own part to gain this
favour; it comes from God alone; therefore let us not strive to understand it.</p>

<p id="ix.i-p14">10.
Concerning my words: &#8216;We can do nothing on our own part,&#8217; I was struck by the
words of the Bride in the Canticles, which you will remember to have heard:
&#8217;The King brought me into the cellar of wine,&#8217;<note n="170" id="ix.i-p14.1"><scripRef passage="Cant. i. 3" id="ix.i-p14.2" parsed="|Song|1|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Song.1.3">Cant. i. 3</scripRef>: &#8216;Introduxit me

in which our Lord places us when and how He chooses, but we cannot enter it
through any effort of our own. His Majesty alone can bring us there and come
into the centre of our souls. In order to declare His wondrous works more
clearly, He will leave us no share in them except complete conformity of our
wills to His and abandonment of all things: He does not require the faculties
or senses to open the door to Him; they are all asleep. He enters the innermost
depths of our souls without a door, as He entered the room where the disciples
sat, saying &#8216;Pax vobis,&#8217;<note n="172" id="ix.i-p14.4">St.
John, xx. 19.</note>&#160; and as He emerged from the sepulchre without
removing the stone that closed the entrance. You will see farther on, in the
seventh mansion, far better than here, how God makes the soul enjoy His
presence in its very centre. O daughters, what wonders shall we see, if we keep
ever before our eyes our own baseness and frailty and recognize how unworthy we
are to be the handmaids of so great a Lord, Whose marvels are beyond our
comprehension! May He be for ever praised! Amen.</p>

<h3 id="ix.ii-p0.1">CHAPTER
II.</h3>

<p class="Centered" id="ix.ii-p1">CONTINUES
THE SAME SUBJECT: EXPLAINS THE PRAYER OF UNION BY A DELICATE COMPARISON AND
SPEAKS OF THE EFFECTS IT LEAVES UPON THE SOUL. THIS CHAPTER SHOULD RECEIVE
GREAT ATTENTION.</p>

<p class="Outline" id="ix.ii-p2"><i>1. The soul compared to a butterfly. 2. The
grandeurs of creation. 3. Symbol of the soul and the silkworm. 4. Preparation
of the soul for God&#8217;s indwelling. 5. Mystic death of the silkworm. 6. Effects
of divine union. 7. Increase of fervour and detachment. 8. Trials succeeding

<p id="ix.ii-p3">1.
You may imagine that there is no more left to be described of the contents of
this mansion, but a great deal remains to be told, for as I said, it contains
favours of various degrees. I think there is nothing to add about the prayer of
union, but when the soul on which God bestows this grace disposes itself for
their reception, I could tell you much about the marvels our Lord works in it.
I will describe some of them in my own way, also the state in which they leave
the soul, and will use a suitable comparison to elucidate the matter,
explaining that though we can take no active part in this work of God within us,<note n="173" id="ix.ii-p3.1"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xxv. 3.</note>&#160; yet we may do much to prepare ourselves to
receive this grace. You have heard how wonderfully silk is made&#8212;in a way such
as God alone could plan&#8212;how it all comes from an egg resembling a tiny
pepper-corn. Not having seen it myself, I only know of it by hearsay, so if the
facts are inaccurate the fault will not be mine. When, in the warm weather, the
mulberry trees <pb n="130" id="ix.ii-Page_130"/>come
into leaf, the little egg which was lifeless before its food was ready, begins
to live. The caterpillar nourishes itself upon the mulberry leaves until, when
it has grown large, people place near it small twigs upon which, of its own
accord, it spins silk from its tiny mouth until it has made a narrow little
cocoon in which it buries itself. Then this large and ugly worm leaves the
cocoon as a lovely little white butterfly.</p>

<p id="ix.ii-p4">2.
If we had not seen this but had only heard of it as an old legend, who could
believe it? Could we persuade ourselves that insects so utterly without the use
of reason as a silkworm or a bee would work with such industry and skill in our
service that the poor little silkworm loses its life over the task? This would
suffice for a short meditation, sisters, without my adding more, for you may
learn from it the wonders and the wisdom of God. How if we knew the properties
of all things? It is most profitable to ponder over the grandeurs of creation
and to exult in being the brides of such a wise and mighty King.</p>

<p id="ix.ii-p5">3.
Let us return to our subject. The silkworm symbolizes the soul which begins to
live when, kindled by the Holy Spirit, it commences using the ordinary aids
given by God to all, and applies the remedies left by Him in His Church, such
as regular confession, religious hooks, and sermons; these are the cure for a
soul dead in its negligence and sins and liable to fall into temptation. Then
it comes to life and continues nourishing itself on this food and on devout
meditation until it has attained full vigour, which is the essential point, <pb n="131" id="ix.ii-Page_131"/>for
I attach no importance to the rest. When the silkworm is full-grown as I told
you in the first part of this chapter, it begins to spin silk and to build the
house wherein it must die. By this house, when speaking of the soul, I mean
Christ. I think I read or heard somewhere, either that our life is hid in
Christ, or in God (which means the same thing) or that Christ is our life.<note n="174" id="ix.ii-p5.1"><scripRef passage="Col. iii. 3" id="ix.ii-p5.2" parsed="|Col|3|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.3.3">Col. iii. 3</scripRef>:
&#8217;Vita vestra est abscondita cum Christo in Deo.&#8217; <scripRef passage="Gal. ii." id="ix.ii-p5.3" parsed="|Gal|2|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.2">Gal. ii.</scripRef> w: &#8216;Vivo autem, jam
on ego; vivit vero in me Christus.&#8217;</note>&#160; It makes little difference to my meaning
which of these quotations is correct.</p>

<p id="ix.ii-p6">4.
This shows, my daughters, how much, by God&#8217;s grace, we can do, by preparing
this home for ourselves, towards making Him our dwelling-place as He is in the
prayer of union. You will suppose that I mean we can take away from or add
something to God when I say that He is our home, and that we can make this home
and dwell in it by our own power. Indeed we can: though we can neither deprive
God of anything nor add aught to Him, yet we can take away from and add to
ourselves, like the silkworms. The little we can do will hardly have been
accomplished when this insignificant work of ours, which amounts to nothing at
all, will be united by God to His greatness and thus enhanced with such immense
value that our Lord Himself will be the reward of our toil. Although He has had
the greatest share in it, He will join our trifling pains to the bitter
sufferings He endured for us and make them one.</p>

<p id="ix.ii-p7">5.
Forward then, my daughters! hasten over your work and build the little cocoon.
Let us renounce <pb n="132" id="ix.ii-Page_132"/>self-love
and self-will,<note n="175" id="ix.ii-p7.1"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xxxi. i 1.</note>&#160; care for nothing earthly, do penance, pray,
mortify ourselves, be obedient, and perform all the other good works of which
you know. Act up to your light; you have been taught your duties. Die! die as
the silkworm does when it has fulfilled the office of its creation, and you
will see God and be immersed in His greatness, as the little silkworm is
enveloped in its cocoon. Understand that when I say &#8216;you will see God,&#8217; I mean
in the manner described, in which He manifests Himself in this kind of union.</p>

<p id="ix.ii-p8">6.
Now let us see what becomes of the &#8216;silkworm,&#8217; for all I have been saying leads
to this. As soon as, by means of this prayer, the soul has become entirely dead
to the world, it comes forth like a lovely little white butterfly!<note n="176" id="ix.ii-p8.1">St. Teresa
must have been thinking of this simile when she chose &#8216;butterflies&#8217; as the
pseudonym for her nuns in her letters at the time when she was obliged to be
cautious on account of the troubles of the Reform.</note>&#160; Oh, how great God is! How beautiful is the
soul after having been immersed in God&#8217;s grandeur and united closely to Him for
but a short time! Indeed, I do not think it is ever as long as half an hour.<note n="177" id="ix.ii-p8.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. xviii. 16. </note>&#160; Truly, the spirit does not recognize itself,
being as different from what it was as is the white butterfly from the
repulsive caterpillar. It does not know how it can have merited so great a
good, or rather, whence this grace came<note n="178" id="ix.ii-p8.3"><i>Life</i>,
ch. xviii. 5-7.</note>&#160; which it well knows it merits not. The soul
desires to praise our Lord God and longs to sacrifice itself and die a thousand
deaths for Him. It feels an unconquerable desire for great <pb n="133" id="ix.ii-Page_133"/>crosses
and would like to perform the most severe penances; it sighs for solitude and
would have all men know God, while it is bitterly grieved at seeing them offend
Him. These matters will be described more fully in the next mansion; there they
are of the same nature, yet in a more advanced state the effects are far
stronger, because, as I told you, if; after the soul has received these
favours, it strives to make still farther progress, it will experience great
things. Oh, to see the restlessness of this charming little butterfly, although
never in its life has it been more tranquil and at peace! May God be praised!
It knows not where to stay nor take its rest; everything on earth disgusts it
after what it has experienced, particularly when God has often given it this
wine which leaves fresh graces behind it at every draught.</p>

<p id="ix.ii-p9">7.
It despises the work it did while yet a caterpillar&#8212;the slow weaving of its
cocoon thread by thread&#8212;its wings have grown and it can fly; could it be
content to crawl? All that it can do for God seems nothing to the soul compared
with its desire. It no longer wonders at what the saints bore for Him, knowing
by experience how our Lord aids and transforms the soul until it no longer
seems the same in character and appearance. Formerly it feared penance, now it
is strong: it wanted courage to forsake relations, friends, or possessions:
neither its actions, its resolutions, nor separation from those it loved could
detach the soul, but rather seemed to increase its fondness. Now it finds even
their rightful claims a burden,<note n="179" id="ix.ii-p9.1"><i>Rel</i>. ix, 11.</note>&#160; fearing contact with <pb n="134" id="ix.ii-Page_134"/>them
lest it should offend God. It wearies of everything, realizing that no true
rest can be found in creatures.</p>

<p id="ix.ii-p10">8.
I seem to have enlarged on this subject, yet far more might be said about it;
those who have received this favour will think I have treated it too briefly.
No wonder this pretty butterfly, estranged from earthly things, seeks repose
elsewhere. Where can the poor little creature go? It cannot return to whence it
came, for as I told you, that is not in the soul&#8217;s power, do what it will, but
depends upon God&#8217;s pleasure. Alas, what fresh trials begin to afflict the mind!
Who would expect this after such a sublime grace?<note n="180" id="ix.ii-p10.1"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xviii. 1-4. <i>Castle</i>,
M. vi ch. i. 3, <i>sqq</i>. M. vii. ch. iv.
7.</note>&#160; In fact in one way or another we must carry
the cross all our lives. If people told me that ever since attaining to the
prayer of union they had enjoyed constant peace and consolation, I should reply
that they could never have reached that state, but that, at the most, if they
had arrived as far as the last mansion, their emotion must have been some
spiritual satisfaction joined to physical debility. It might even have been a
false sweetness caused by the devil, who gives peace for a time only to wage
far fiercer war later on. I do not mean that those who reach this stage possess
no peace; they do so in a very high degree, for their sorrows, though extremely
severe, are so beneficial and proceed from so good a source as to procure both
peace and happiness.</p>

<p id="ix.ii-p11">9.
Discontent with this world gives such a painful longing to quit it that, if the
heart finds comfort, <pb n="135" id="ix.ii-Page_135"/>it
is solely from the thought that God wishes it to remain here in banishment.
Even this is not enough to reconcile it to fate, for after all the gifts
received, it is not yet so entirely surrendered to the will of God as it
afterwards becomes. Here, although conformed to His will, the soul feels an
unconquerable reluctance to submit, for our Lord has not given it higher grace.
During prayer this grief breaks forth in floods of tears, probably from the
great pain felt at seeing God offended and at thinking how many souls, both
heretics and heathens, are lost eternally, and keenest grief of all, Christians
also! The soul realizes the greatness of God&#8217;s mercy and knows that however
wicked men are, they may still repent and be saved; yet it fears that many
precipitate themselves into hell.</p>

<p id="ix.ii-p12">10.
Oh, infinite greatness of God! A few years ago&#8212;indeed, perhaps but a few
days&#8212;this soul thought of nothing but itself. Who has made it feel such
tormenting cares? If we tried for many years to obtain such sorrow by means of
meditation, we could not succeed.</p>

<p id="ix.ii-p13">11.
God help me! If for long days and years I considered how great a wrong it is
that God should be offended, and that lost souls are His children and my
brethren; if I pondered over the dangers of this world and how blessed it would
be to leave this wretched life, would not that suffice? No, daughters, the pain
would not be the same. for this, by the help of God, we can obtain by such
meditation; but it does not seem to penetrate the very depths of our being like
the other which <pb n="136" id="ix.ii-Page_136"/>appears
to cut the soul to pieces and grind it to powder through no action&#8212;even
sometimes with no wish&#8212;of its own. What is this sorrow, then? Whence does it
come? I will tell you. Have you not heard (I quoted the words to you just now,
but did not apply to them this meaning)<note n="181" id="ix.ii-p13.1">Fifth Mansions, ch. i. 10.</note>&#160; how the Bride says that God &#8216;brought her into
the cellar of wine and set in order charity in her&#8217;?<note n="182" id="ix.ii-p13.2"><i>Cant</i>. ii. 4. &#8216;Introduxit me in cellam vinariam, ordinavit in me
caritatem.&#8217;</note>&#160; This is what happens here. The soul has so
entirely yielded itself into His hands and is so subdued by love for Him that
it knows or cares for nothing but that God should dispose of it according to
His will. I believe that He only bestows this grace on those He takes entirely
for His own. He desires that, without knowing how, the spirit should come forth
stamped with His seal for indeed it does no more than does the wax when
impressed with the signet. It does not mould itself but need only be in a fit
condition&#8212;soft and pliable; even then it does not soften itself but must
merely remain still and submit to the impression.</p>

<p id="ix.ii-p14">12.
How good Thou art, O God! All is done for us by Thee, Who dost but ask us to
give our wills to Thee that we may be plastic as wax in Thy hands. You see,
sisters, what God does to this soul so that it may know that it is His. He
gives it something of His own&#8212;that which His Son possessed when living on
earth&#8212;He could bestow on greater gift on us. Who could ever have longed more
eagerly to leave this life than did Christ? <pb n="137" id="ix.ii-Page_137"/> As He said at the Last Supper: &#8216;With
desire have I desired&#8217;<note n="183" id="ix.ii-p14.1">St.
<scripRef passage="Luke xxii. 15" id="ix.ii-p14.2" parsed="|Luke|22|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.22.15">Luke xxii. 15</scripRef>: &#8216;Desiderio desideravi hoc pascha manducare vobiscum, antequam
patiar.&#8217;</note>&#160; this. O Lord! does not that bitter death Thou
art to undergo present itself before Thine eyes in all its pain and horror?
&#8217;No, for My ardent love and My desire to save souls are immeasurably stronger
than the torments. This deeper sorrow I have suffered and still suffer while
living here on earth, makes other pain seem as nothing in comparison.&#8217;</p>

<p id="ix.ii-p15">13.
I have often meditated on this and I know that the torture a friend of mine<note n="184" id="ix.ii-p15.1">This friend
is, of course, St. Teresa herself. See <i>Life</i>,
ch. xiii. 14; xxxii. 9. <i>Way of Perf</i>.
ch. i. 3. <i>Castle</i>, M. vii. ch. i. 5,
6. <i>Excl</i>. x. 9.</note>&#160; has felt, and still feels, at seeing our Lord
sinned against is so unbearable that she would far rather die than continue in
such anguish. Then I thought that if a soul whose charity is so weak compared
to that of Christ&#8212;indeed, in comparison with His this charity might be said
not to exist&#8212;experiences this insufferable grief, what must have been the feelings
of our Lord Jesus Christ and what must His life have been? for all things were
present before His eyes and He was the constant witness of the great offences
committed against His Father. I believe without doubt that this pained Him far
more than His most sacred Passion. There, at least, He found the end of all His
trials, while His agony was allayed by the consolation of gaining our salvation
through His death and of proving how He loved His Father by suffering for Him.
Thus, people who, urged by fervent love, perform great penances <pb n="138" id="ix.ii-Page_138"/>hardly
feel them but want to do still more and count even that as little. What, then,
must His Majesty have felt at thus publicly manifesting His perfect obedience
to His Father and His love for His brethren? What joy to suffer in doing God&#8217;s
will! Yet I think the constant sight of the many sins committed against God and
of the numberless souls on their way to hell must have caused Him such anguish
that, had He not been more than man, one day of such torment would have
destroyed not only His life but many more lives, had they been His.</p>

<div2 title="Chapter III. Cause of Union" progress="42.31%" prev="ix.ii" next="ix.iv" id="ix.iii">


<h3 id="ix.iii-p0.1">CHAPTER
III.</h3>

<p class="Centered" id="ix.iii-p1">THIS
CHAPTER CONTINUES THE SAME SUBJECT AND SPEAKS OF ANOTHER KIND OF UNION WHICH
THE SOUL CAN OBTAIN WITH THE HELP OF GOD. THE IMPORTANCE OF LOVE OF OUR
NEIGHBOUR IN THIS MATTER. THIS IS VERY USEFUL TO READ.</p>

<p class="Outline" id="ix.iii-p2"><i>1. Zeal for souls left by divine union. 2.
The soul may fall from such a state. 3. How divine union may always be
obtained. 4. Union with the will of God the basis of all supernatural union. 5.
Advantage of union gained by self-mortification. 6. Defects which hinder this
union. 7. Divine union obtained by perfect love of God and our neighbour. 8.
Love for God and our neighbour are proportionate. 9. Real and imaginary
virtues. 10. Illusionary good resolutions. 11. Works, not feelings, procure
union. 12. Fraternal charity will certainly gain this union</i>.</p>

<p id="ix.iii-p3">1.
LET us now return to our little dove and see what graces God gives it in this
state. This implies that the soul endeavours to advance in the service of our
Lord and in self-knowledge. If it receives the grace of union and then does no
more, thinking itself safe, and so leads a careless life, wandering off the
road to heaven (that is, the keeping of the <pb n="139" id="ix.iii-Page_139"/>commandments)
it will share the fate of the butterfly that comes from the silkworm, which
lays some eggs that produce more of its kind and then dies for ever. I say it
leaves some eggs, for I believe God will not allow so great a favour to be lost
but that if the recipient does not profit by it, others will. For while it
keeps to the right path, this soul, with its ardent desires and great virtues,
helps others and kindles their fervour with its own. Yet even after having lost
this it may still long to benefit others and delight to make known the mercies
shown by God to those who love and serve Him.<note n="185" id="ix.iii-p3.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. vii. 18. <i>Way of
Perf</i>. xli. 8.</note>
</p>

<p id="ix.iii-p4">2.
I knew a person to whom this happened. Although greatly erring, she longed that
others should profit by the favours God had bestowed on her and taught the way
of prayer to people ignorant of it, thus helping them immensely. God afterwards
bestowed fresh light upon her; indeed the prayer of union had not hitherto
produced the above effects in her. How many people there must be to whom our
Lord communicates Himself, who, like Judas, are called to the Apostleship and
made kings by Him, as was Saul, yet who afterwards lose everything by their own
fault! We should learn from this, sisters, that if we would merit fresh favours
and avoid losing those we already possess, our only safety lies in obedience
and in following the law of God. This I say, both to those who have received
these graces and to those who have not.<note n="186" id="ix.iii-p4.1"><i>Life</i>.
ch, vii. 21.</note>
</p>

<p id="ix.iii-p5">3.
In spite of all I have written, there still seems some difficulty in
understanding this mansion. The <pb n="140" id="ix.iii-Page_140"/>advantage
of entering is so great, that it is well that none should despair of doing so
because God does not give them the supernatural gifts described above. With the
help of divine grace true union can always be attained by forcing ourselves to
renounce our own will and by following the will of God in all things.<note n="187" id="ix.iii-p5.1"><i>Found</i>. ch. v. 10. &#8216;These shall not
attain to the true liberty of a pure heart, nor to the grace of a delightful
familiarity with Me, unless they first resign themselves and offer themselves a
daily sacrifice to Me: for without this, divine union neither is nor will be
obtained.&#8217; (Imitation, book iii. ch. xxxvii. 4.)</note></p>

<p id="ix.iii-p6">4.
Oh, how many of us affirm that we do this, and believe we seek nothing
else&#8212;indeed we would die for the truth of what we say! If this be the case I
can only declare, as I fancy I did before, and I shall again and again, that we
have already obtained this grace from God. Therefore we need not wish for that
other delightful union described above, for its chief value lies in the
resignation of our will to that of God without which it could not be reached.<note n="188" id="ix.iii-p6.1">Philippus a
SS. Trinitate, <i>l.c.</i>, p. iii. tr. i,
disc. ii. art. 4.</note>&#160; Oh, how desirable is this union! The happy
soul which has attained it will live in this world and in the next without care
of any sort. No earthly events can trouble it, unless it should see itself in
danger of losing God or should witness any offence offered Him. Neither
sickness, poverty, nor the loss of any one by death affect it, except that of
persons useful to the Church of God, for the soul realizes thoroughly that
God&#8217;s disposal is wiser than its own desires.</p>

<p id="ix.iii-p7">5.
You must know that there are different kinds <pb n="141" id="ix.iii-Page_141"/>of
sorrow: there are both griefs and joys rising from an impulse of nature or from
a charity which makes us pity our neighbour, like that felt by our Saviour when
He raised Lazarus from the dead.<note n="189" id="ix.iii-p7.1">St.
<scripRef passage="John xi. 35, 36" id="ix.iii-p7.2" parsed="|John|11|35|11|36" osisRef="Bible:John.11.35-John.11.36">John xi. 35, 36</scripRef>: &#8216;Et lacrymatus est Jesus. Dixerunt ergo Jud&#230;i: Ecce quomodo amabat
cum.&#8217;</note>&#160; These feelings do not destroy union with the
will of God nor do they disturb the soul by a restless, turbulent, and lasting
passion. They soon pass away, for as I said of sweetness in prayer,<note n="190" id="ix.iii-p7.3">Fourth
Mansions, ch. i. 5. Fifth Mansions, ch. i. 7.</note>&#160; they do not affect the depths of the soul but
only its senses and faculties. They are found in the former mansions, but do
not enter the last of all. Is it necessary, in order to attain to this kind of
divine union, for the powers of the soul to be suspended? No; God has many ways
of enriching the soul and bringing it to these mansions besides what might be
called a &#8216;short cut.&#8217; But, be sure of this, my daughters: in any case the
silkworm must die and it will cost you more in this way. In the former manner
this death is facilitated by finding ourselves introduced into a new life;
here, on the contrary, we must give ourselves the death-blow. I own that the
work will be much harder, but then it will be of higher value so that your
reward will be greater if you come forth victorious;<note n="191" id="ix.iii-p7.4"><i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. xvii. 2.</note>&#160; yet
there is no doubt it is possible for you to attain this true union with the
will of God.</p>

<p id="ix.iii-p8">6.
This is the union I have longed for all my life and that I beg our Lord to grant
me; it is the most certain and the safest. But alas, how few of us ever
<pb n="142" id="ix.iii-Page_142"/>obtain
it! Those who are careful not to offend God, and who enter the religious state,
think there is nothing more to do. How many maggots remain in hiding until,
like the worm which gnawed at Jonas&#8217;s ivy,<note n="192" id="ix.iii-p8.1">Jonas iv. 6, 7: &#8216;And the
Lord God prepared an ivy, and it came up over the head of Jonas, to be a shadow
over his head, and to cover him, for he was fatigued; and Jonas was exceeding
glad of the ivy. But God prepared a worm, when the morning arose on the
following day: and it struck the ivy and it withered.&#8217;</note>&#160; they have destroyed our virtues. These pests
are such evils as self-love, self-esteem, rash judgment of others even in small
matters, and a want of charity in not loving our neighbour quite as much as
ourselves. Although perforce we satisfy our obligations sufficiently to avoid
sin, yet we fall far short of what must be done in order to obtain perfect
union with the will of God.</p>

<p id="ix.iii-p9">7.
What do you think, daughters, is His will? That we may become quite perfect and
so be made one with Him and with His Father as He prayed we might be.<note n="193" id="ix.iii-p9.1">St. <scripRef passage="John xvii. 22, 23" id="ix.iii-p9.2" parsed="|John|17|22|17|23" osisRef="Bible:John.17.22-John.17.23">John

ch. xxxii. 6.</note>&#160; Observe, then, what is wanting in us to
obtain this. I assure you it is most painful for me to write on this subject,
for I see how far I am, through my own fault, from having attained perfection.
There is no need for us to receive special consolations from God in order to
arrive at conformity with His will; He has done enough in giving us His Son to
teach the way. This does not mean that we must so submit to the will of God as
not to sorrow at such troubles as the death of a father or brother, or that we
must bear crosses <pb n="143" id="ix.iii-Page_143"/>and
sickness with joy.<note n="194" id="ix.iii-p9.3"><i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. ix. i, 2.</note>&#160; This is well, but it sometimes comes from
common sense which, as we cannot help ourselves, makes a virtue of necessity.
How often the great wisdom of the heathen philosophers led them to act thus in
trials of this kind! Our Lord asks but two things of us: love, for Him and for
our neighbour: these are what we must strive to obtain. If we practise both
these virtues perfectly we shall be doing His will and so shall be united to
Him. But, as I said, we are very far from obeying and serving our great Master
perfectly in these two matters: may His Majesty give us the grace to merit
union with Him; it is in our power to gain it if we will.</p>

<p id="ix.iii-p10">8.
I think the most certain sign that we keep these two commandments is that we
have a genuine love for others. We cannot know whether we love God although
there may be strong reasons for thinking so, but there can be no doubt about
whether we love our neighbour or no.<note n="195" id="ix.iii-p10.1">1 St. <scripRef passage="John iv. 20" id="ix.iii-p10.2" parsed="|John|4|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.4.20">John iv. 20</scripRef>: &#8216;Qui enim non diligit
fratrem suum quem videt, Deum quem non videt quomodo potest diligere?&#8217;</note>&#160; Be sure that in proportion as you advance in
fraternal charity, you are increasing in your love of God,<note n="196" id="ix.iii-p10.3"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xviii. 5.</note>&#160; for
His Majesty bears so tender an affection for us that I cannot doubt He will
repay our love for others by augmenting, in a thousand different ways, that
which we bear for Him. We should watch most carefully over ourselves in this
matter, for if we are faultless on this point we have done all. I believe human
nature is so evil that we could not feel a perfect <pb n="144" id="ix.iii-Page_144"/>charity
for our neighbour unless it were rooted in the love of God.</p>

<p id="ix.iii-p11">9.
In this most important matter, sisters, we should be most vigilant in little
things, taking no notice of the great works we plan during prayer which we
imagine that we would perform for other people, even perhaps for the sake of
saving a single soul. If our actions afterwards belie these grand schemes,
there is no reason to imagine that we should do anything of the sort. I say the
same of humility and the other virtues. The devil&#8217;s wiles are many; he would
turn hell upside down a thousand times to make us think ourselves better than
we are. He has good reason for it, for such fancies are most injurious; sham
virtues springing from this root are always accompanied by a vainglory never
found in those of divine origin, which are free from pride.</p>

<p id="ix.iii-p12">10.
It is amusing to see souls who, while they are at prayer, fancy they are
willing to be despised and publicly insulted for the love of God, yet
afterwards do all they can to hide their small defects; if any one unjustly
accuses them of a fault, God deliver us from their outcries! Let those who
cannot bear such things take no notice of the splendid plans they made when
alone, which could have been no genuine determination of the will but only some
trick of the imagination, or the results would have been very different. The
devil assaults and deceives people in this way, often doing great harm to women
and others too ignorant to understand the difference between the powers of the
soul and the imagination, and a thousand other matters of <pb n="145" id="ix.iii-Page_145"/>the
sort. O sisters! how easy it is to know which of you have attained to a sincere
love of your neighbour, and which of you are far from it. If you knew the
importance of this virtue, your only care would be to gain it.</p>

<p id="ix.iii-p13">11.
When I see people very anxious to know what sort of prayer they practise,
covering their faces and afraid to move or think lest they should lose any
slight tenderness and devotion they feel, I know how little they understand how
to attain union with God since they think it consists in such things as these.
No, sisters, no; our Lord expects <i>works</i>
from us. If you see a sick sister whom you can relieve,<note n="197" id="ix.iii-p13.1"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. vii. 4.</note>&#160;
never fear losing your devotion; compassionate her; if she is in pain,
feel for it as if it were your own and, when there is need, fast so that she
may eat, not so much for her sake as because you know your Lord asks it of you.
This is the true union of our will with the will of God. If some one else is
well spoken of, be more pleased than if it were yourself; this is easy enough,
for if you were really humble it would vex you to be praised. It is a great
good to rejoice at your sister&#8217;s virtues being known and to feel as sorry for
the fault you see in her as if it were yours, hiding it from the sight of
others.</p>

<p id="ix.iii-p14">12.
I have often spoken on this subject elsewhere,<note n="198" id="ix.iii-p14.1"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. iv. 3; vii. 4.</note>&#160; because, my sisters, if we fail in this I
know that all is lost: please God this may never be our case. If you possess
fraternal charity, I assure you that you will certainly obtain the union I have
described. <pb n="146" id="ix.iii-Page_146"/> If
you are conscious that you are wanting in this charity, although you may feel
devotion and sweetness and a short absorption in the prayer of quiet (which
makes you think you have attained to union with God), believe me you have not
yet reached it. Beg our Lord to grant you perfect love for your neighbour, and
leave the rest to Him. He will give you more than you know how to desire if you
constrain yourselves and strive with all your power to gain it, forcing your
will as far as possible to comply in all things with your sisters&#8217; wishes
although you may sometimes forfeit your own rights by so doing. Forget your
self-interests for theirs, how ever much nature may rebel; when opportunity
occurs take some burden upon yourself to ease your neighbour of it. Do not
fancy it will cost you nothing and that you will find it all done for you:
think what the love He bore for us cost our Spouse, Who to free us from death,
Himself suffered the most painful death of all&#8212;the death of the Cross.</p>

<p id="ix.iv-p3">1.
You appear anxious to know what has become of the little dove and where she
obtains rest, since obviously she can find it neither in spiritual consolations
nor in earthly pleasures but takes a higher flight. I cannot tell you until we
come to the last mansion: God grant I may remember or have leisure to write it.
It is nearly five months since I began this work, and as my head is too weak to
read it again, no doubt it will be very disconnected and full of repetitions:
however, as it is only for my sisters, that will matter little. Yet I should
like to express myself more fully about the prayer of union and will make use,
to the best of my scanty wits, of a comparison. Later on we will speak of the
little butterfly, which is never still, for it can find no true repose, yet
always fertile, doing good both to itself and others.<note n="199" id="ix.iv-p3.1">Compare: &#8216;habebit fructum in
respectione animarum sanctarum&#8217; (<i>Breviar.
Rom. Ant. ad Laudes de Com. Virg</i>.); &#8216;quasi apis argumentosa Domino
deservisti&#8217; (<i>Ibid</i>. Feast of St.
C&#230;cilia.)</note>&#160; You have often heard that God spiritually
espouses souls: may He be <pb n="148" id="ix.iv-Page_148"/>praised
for His mercy in thus humbling Himself so utterly. Though but a homely
comparison, yet I can find nothing better to express my meaning than the
Sacrament of Matrimony although the two things are very different. In divine
union everything is spiritual and far removed from anything corporal, all the
joys our Lord gives and the mutual delight felt in it being celestial and very
unlike human marriage, which it excels a thousand times. Here all is love
united to love; its operations are more pure, refined, and sweet than can be
described, though our Lord knows how to make the soul sensible of them.</p>

<p id="ix.iv-p4">2.
I think this union does not attain as far as the spiritual espousals but
resembles the preliminaries that take place when two people are contemplating a
betrothal. Their suitability and willingness for the alliance are first
discussed; then they may be allowed to see one another sometimes so as to come
to a decision. Thus it is in the spiritual espousals: when the preliminary
agreement has been made and the soul thoroughly understands what great
advantages she will gain, having resolved to fulfil the will of her Spouse in
all things and to do all she can to please Him, His Majesty Who knows well
whether this is so in reality, wishes in return to gratify His bride. He therefore
bestows this favour upon her, visits her and draws her into His presence, as He
wishes her to know Him better. We might compare the prayer of union to a visit,
for it lasts but a very little while.<note n="200" id="ix.iv-p4.1"><i>Life</i>,
ch. xviii.</note>&#160; There is no longer any <pb n="149" id="ix.iv-Page_149"/>question
of deliberation, but the soul in a secret manner sees to what a Bridegroom it
is betrothed; the senses and faculties could not, in a thousand years, gain the
knowledge thus imparted in a very short time. The Spouse, being Who He is,
leaves the soul far more deserving of completing the espousals, as we may call
them; the enamoured soul in its love for Him makes every effort to prevent
their being frustrated. Should it grow neglectful and set its affections on
anything except our Lord, it will forfeit everything: this loss is as great as
are the favours the soul has continually received, which are precious beyond
description.<note n="201" id="ix.iv-p4.2"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xxxi. 10.</note></p>

<p id="ix.iv-p5">3.
O Christian souls! you whom God has brought thus far! I implore you for His dear
sake not to grow careless, but to avoid all occasions of sin; you are not
strong enough yet to undergo temptation, as you will be after the espousals
which take place in the next mansion. Here the betrothed are, as they say, only
acquainted by sight,<note n="202" id="ix.iv-p5.1">Phil.
a SS. Trinit. <i>l.c.</i> p. iii. tract. i.
disc. ii. art. 2.</note>&#160; and the devil will spare no pains to oppose
and prevent their nuptials. Afterwards, when he sees the Bride is wholly given
to her Bridegroom, he is afraid to interfere, having learnt by experience that
if he molests her, while he loses much, she will gain greatly in merit.</p>

<p id="ix.iv-p6">4.
I can assure you, my daughters,<note n="203" id="ix.iv-p6.1">Contrast
with this paragraph what the Saint says in her <i>Life</i>, ch. xix. &#167; 8.</note>&#160; that I have known people far advanced in the
spiritual life who had reached this state of prayer yet whom the devil
reclaimed by his subtlety and wiles: as I <pb n="150" id="ix.iv-Page_150"/>have
often said, all hell leagues together against such souls because the loss of
one of them entails the perdition of many more, as Satan is well aware. If we
considered how many men God draws to Himself by means of one, we should praise
Him fervently. Think of the multitudes converted by the martyrs or by one young
maiden like St. Ursula! Again, of how many victims the evil one was deprived by
St. Dominic, St. Francis, and other founders of religious orders. How many more
he loses, even now, through Father Ignatius [Loyola], who founded the Company
[of Jesus]! As we read their lives, we learn that they received such graces
from God. How was this great good done except by their efforts not to forfeit,
through any fault of theirs, these divine espousals? Oh, my daughters, how
willing our Lord is to grant us the same graces! In fact, there is even more
urgent need now for persons to prepare for such favours, since there are fewer
who care for His honour. We love ourselves too much and are too prudent to give
up any of our rights. What a deception! May God in His mercy give us light,
lest we sink into such darkness.</p>

<p id="ix.iv-p7">5.
You may question or be in doubt on two points. Firstly: if the soul is entirely
united with the will of God, as I have stated, how can it be deceived, since it
ever seeks to follow His pleasure? Secondly, how can the devil enter and work
such havoc as to destroy your soul while you are so utterly withdrawn from the
world and constantly frequent the Sacraments?<note n="204" id="ix.iv-p7.1"><i>Life</i>, ch, xxxvi. 26; xxxix. 14. <i>Found</i>.
ch. i. 1-4.</note>&#160; At the same time you enjoy the society <pb n="151" id="ix.iv-Page_151"/>of
angels (as we might call them) and by the mercy of God you desire nothing but
to serve and please Him in all things?<note n="205" id="ix.iv-p7.2"><i>Way of
Perf</i>. ch. i, 2; xiii. 3. <i>Found</i>.
ch. i. 3.</note>&#160; It is not surprising that people in the world
should run such risks. I admit you have the right to say this, for God has
shown us signal mercy; but, as I said above, knowing as I do that Judas was
amongst the Apostles and that he held constant intercourse with God Himself, to
Whose words he listened, I learn that the state of religion does not make us
safe.</p>

<p id="ix.iv-p8">6.
To your first question I reply that doubtless if such a soul is always faithful
to the will of God, it cannot be lost; the evil one, however, comes with his
keen subtlety and, under the pretext of good, leads it astray in some trivial
matter and causes it to commit small defects which he makes it believe are
harmless. Thus, little by little, the reason is obscured and the will is
weakened while the devil fosters his victim&#8217;s self-love, until, by degrees, he
succeeds in withdrawing it from union with the will of God and makes it follow its
own will.</p>

<p id="ix.iv-p9">7.
The answer to your first inquiry will serve for the second. No enclosure can be
too strict for Satan to enter nor any desert too remote for him to visit.
Besides, God may permit him to tempt the soul to prove its virtue; for as He
intends it to enlighten others, it is better for it to fail in the beginning
than when it might do them great harm.</p>

<p id="ix.iv-p10">8.
We must beg God constantly in our prayers to uphold us by His hand; we should
keep ever in our minds the truth that if He leaves us, most <pb n="152" id="ix.iv-Page_152"/>certainly
we shall fall at once into the abyss, for we must never be so foolish as to
trust in ourselves. After this I think the greatest safeguard is to be very
careful and to watch how we advance in virtue; we must notice whether we are
making progress or falling back in it, especially as regards the love of our
neighbour, the desire to be thought the least of all and how we perform our
ordinary, everyday duties. If we attend to this and beg Our Lord to enlighten
us, we shall at once perceive our gain or loss.</p>

<p id="ix.iv-p11">9.
Do not suppose that after advancing the soul to such a state God abandons it so
easily that it is light work for the devil to regain it. When His Majesty sees
it leaving Him, He feels the loss so keenly that He gives it in many a way a
thousand secret warnings which reveal to it the hidden danger.<note n="206" id="ix.iv-p11.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xix. 9.</note>
</p>

<p id="ix.iv-p12">10.
In conclusion, let us strive to make constant progress: we ought to feel great
alarm if we do not find ourselves advancing, for without doubt the evil one
must be planning to injure us in some way; it is impossible for a soul that has
come to this state not to go still farther, for love is never idle. Therefore
it is a very bad sign when one comes to a stand-still in virtue. She who
aspires to become the spouse of God Himself, and has treated with His Majesty
and come to such an understanding with Him, must not leave off and go to sleep.<note n="207" id="ix.iv-p12.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xix. 7.</note></p>

<p id="ix.iv-p13">11.
To show you, my daughters, how Christ treats the souls He takes for His brides,
I will now speak <pb n="153" id="ix.iv-Page_153"/>of
the sixth mansions. You will then see how little in comparison is all that we
can do or suffer in His service to prepare ourselves for the reception of such
immense favours. Perhaps our Lord decreed that I should write this in order
that the knowledge of the great reward to come, and of His infinite mercy in
seeking to give and to manifest Himself to such worms as we are, might make us
forget our wretched, petty, earthly pleasures and run on our way with eyes
fixed on His grandeur, inflamed with love for Him.</p>

<p id="ix.iv-p14">12.
May He enable me to explain some of these difficult matters; if our Lord and
the Holy Ghost do not guide my pen, I know the task will prove impossible. 1
beg Him to prevent my saying anything unless it will profit you. His Majesty
knows that, as far as I can judge, I have no other wish but that His Name may
be glorified and that we may strive to serve a Lord Who thus recompenses our
efforts even in this world. What, then, will be our joy in heaven where it will
be continuous, without the interruptions, labours, and dangers of this
tempestuous sea of life? Were it not for the fear of losing or offending Him,
we should wish to live until the end of the world<note n="208" id="ix.iv-p14.1"><i>Rel</i>. ix. 19.</note>&#160; in order to work for so great a God&#8212;our Lord
and our Spouse. May His Majesty enable us to render Him some service free from
the many faults we always commit, even in good works! Amen.</p>

<p id="x.i-p3">1.
BY the aid of the Holy Ghost I am now about to treat of the sixth mansions,
where the soul, wounded with love for its Spouse, sighs more than ever for
solitude, withdrawing as far as the duties of its state permit from all that
can interrupt it, <pb n="155" id="x.i-Page_155"/>
The sight it has enjoyed of Him is so deeply imprinted on the spirit that its
only desire is to behold Him again. I have already said that,<note n="209" id="x.i-p3.1"><i>Castle</i>, M. v. ch. i. 9. <i>Life</i>,
ch. xxviii. 5.</note>&#160; even by the imagination, nothing is seen in
this prayer that can be called sight. I speak of it as &#8216;sight&#8217; because of the
comparison I used.</p>

<p id="x.i-p4">2.
The soul is now determined to take no other Bridegroom than our Lord, but He
disregards its desires for its speedy espousals, wishing that these longings
should become still more vehement and that this good, which far excels all
other benefits, should be purchased at some cost to itself. And although for so
great a gain all that we must endure is but a poor price to pay, I assure you,
daughters, that this pledge of what is in store for us is needed to inspire us
with courage to bear our crosses.</p>

<p id="x.i-p5">3.
O My God, how many troubles both interior and exterior must one suffer before
entering the seventh mansions! Sometimes, while pondering over this I fear
that, were they known beforehand, human infirmity could scarcely bear the
thought nor resolve to encounter them, however great might appear the gain. If,
however, the soul has already reached the seventh mansions, it fears nothing:
boldly undertaking to suffer all things for God,<note n="210" id="x.i-p5.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xl. 28. <i>sqq</i>.</note>&#160; it gathers strength from its almost
uninterrupted union with Him.</p>

<p id="x.i-p6">4.
I think it would be well to tell you of some of the trials certain to occur in
this state. Possibly all souls may not be led in this way, but I think that
those who sometimes enjoy such truly heavenly <pb n="156" id="x.i-Page_156"/>favours
cannot be altogether free from some sort of earthly troubles. Therefore,
although at first I did not intend to speak on this subject, yet afterwards I
thought that it might greatly comfort a soul in this condition if it knew what
usually happens to those on whom God bestows graces of this kind, for at the
time they really seem to have lost everything.</p>

<p id="x.i-p7">5.
I shall not enumerate these trials in their proper order, but will describe
them as they come to my memory, beginning with the least severe. This is an
outcry raised against such a person by those amongst whom she lives, and even
from others she has nothing to do with but who fancy that at some time in her
life they recollect having seen her. They say she wants to pass for a saint,
that she goes to extremes in piety to deceive the world and to depreciate
people who are better Christians than herself without making such a parade of
it. But notice that she does nothing except endeavour to carry out the duties
of her state more perfectly. Persons she thought were her friends desert her,
making the most bitter remarks of all. They take it much to heart that her soul
is ruined&#8212;she is manifestly deluded&#8212;it is all the devil&#8217;s work&#8212;she will
share the fate of so-and-so who was lost through him, and she is leading virtue
astray. They cry out that she is deceiving her confessors, and tell them so,
citing examples of others who came to ruin in the same way and make a thousand
scoffing remarks of the same sort.<note n="211" id="x.i-p7.1">The
Saint went through all this herself; every detail is taken from her own
experience. See <i>Life</i>, ch. xxv. 20;
xxviii. 20-24; xxx. 6; xxiii. 2. Anton. a Sp. S. <i>l.c.</i> tract, ii. n. 268.</note>
 <pb n="157" id="x.i-Page_157"/>6.
I know some one who feared she would be unable to find any priest who would
hear her confession, to such a pass did things come; but as it is a long story,
I will not stop to tell it now. The worst of it is, these troubles do not blow
over but last all her life, for one person warns the other to have nothing to
do with people of her kind. You will say that, on the other hand, some speak in
her favour. O my daughters, how few think well of her in comparison with the
many who hate her!</p>

<p id="x.i-p8">7.
Besides this, praise pains such a soul more than blame because it recognizes
clearly that any good it possesses is the gift of God and in no wise its own,
seeing that but a short time ago it was weak in virtue and involved in grave
sins.<note n="212" id="x.i-p8.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxviii. 19.</note>&#160; Therefore commendation causes it intolerable
suffering, at least at first, although later on, for many reasons, the soul is
comparatively indifferent to either.</p>

<p id="x.i-p9">8.
The first is that experience has shown the mind that men are as ready to speak
well as ill of others, so it attaches no more importance to the one than to the
other. Secondly, our Lord having granted it greater light, it perceives that no
good thing in it is its own but is His gift, and becomes oblivious of self,
praising God for His graces as if they were found in a third person.</p>

<p id="x.i-p10">9.
The third reason is that, realizing the benefit reaped by others from
witnessing graces given it by God, such a one thinks that it is for their
profit He causes them to discover in her virtues that do not exist. <pb n="158" id="x.i-Page_158"/>10.
Fourthly, souls seeking God&#8217;s honour and glory more than their own are cured of
the temptation (which usually besets beginners) of thinking that human praise
will cause them the injury they have seen it do to others. Nor do these souls
care much for men&#8217;s contempt if only, by their means, any one should praise God
at least once&#8212;come what may afterwards.</p>

<p id="x.i-p11">11.
These and other reasons to a certain extent allay the great distress formerly
given by human praise which, however, still causes some discomfort unless the
soul has become utterly regardless of men&#8217;s tongues. It is infinitely more
grieved at being undeservedly esteemed by the world than by any calumny; and
when at last it becomes almost indifferent to praise, it cares still less for
censure, which even pleases it and sounds like harmonious music to the ears.</p>

<p id="x.i-p12">12.
This is perfectly true; the soul is rather strengthened than depressed by its
trials, experience having taught it the great advantages derived from them. It
does not think men offend God by persecuting it, but that He permits them to do
so for its greater gain.<note n="213" id="x.i-p12.1"><i>Rel</i>. ii. 4.</note>&#160; So strong is this belief that such a person
bears a special affection for these people, holding them as truer friends and
greater benefactors than those who speak well of her.<note n="214" id="x.i-p12.2">Anton. a Sp. S. <i>l.c.</i> ii. n. 272. <i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xv. i; xvii. 4. <i>Found</i>. ch. xxvii. 19, 20. <i>Life</i>,
ch. xix. 12; xxxi. 13-17, 25.</note>
</p>

<p id="x.i-p13">13.
Our Lord now usually sends severe bodily infirmity. This is a far heavier
cross, especially if acute pain is felt: if this is violent, I think 
it is the <pb n="159" id="x.i-Page_159"/>hardest
of earthly trials. I speak of exterior trials; but corporal pains of the
worst kind enter the interior of our being also, affecting both spirit and
body, so that the soul in its anguish knows not what to do with itself and
would far rather meet death at once by some quick martyrdom than suffer thus. However,
these paroxysms do not last long, for God never sends us more than we can bear
and always gives us patience first.</p>

<p id="x.i-p14">14.
Now to speak of other trials and illnesses of many kinds which generally occur
to people in this state. I knew some one who, from the time when, forty years
ago,<note n="215" id="x.i-p14.1">&#8217;Forty
years ago.&#8217; The Saint seems to refer to her first experience in the mystical
life, which took place during her illness in the winter of 1537-38. See <i>Life</i>, ch. iv. 9.</note>&#160; our Lord began to bestow on her the favour
described, could not affirm with any truth that she had been a single day
without pain and other kinds of suffering: I am speaking of physical
infirmities besides heavy crosses sent her.<note n="216" id="x.i-p14.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. iv. 6; v; vi; vii. 18; xi. 23; XXX. 9.</note>&#160; True, she had led a wicked life and therefore
held these troubles very light in comparison with the hell she had deserved.<note n="217" id="x.i-p14.3"><i>Ibid</i>. ch. iii. 6, 7.</note>&#160; Our Lord leads those who have offended Him
less by some other way, but I should always choose the way of suffering, if
only for the sake of imitating our Lord Jesus Christ; though, in fact, it
profits us in many other manners. Yet, oh! the rest would seem trifling in
comparison could I relate the interior torments met with here, but they are
impossible to describe.</p>

<p id="x.i-p15">15.
Let us first speak of the trial of meeting with so timorous and 
inexperienced a confessor that <pb n="160" id="x.i-Page_160"/>nothing
seems safe to him; he dreads and suspects everything but the commonplace,
especially in a soul in which he deters any imperfection, for he thinks people
on whom God bestows such favours must be angels, which is impossible while we
live in our bodies.<note n="218" id="x.i-p15.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xiii. 21-27. <i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. v. 1, 2.</note>&#160; He at once ascribes everything to the devil
or melancholy. As to the latter, I am not surprised; there is so much of it in
the world and the evil one works such harm in this way that confessors have the
strongest reasons for anxiety and watchfulness about it.</p>

<p id="x.i-p16">16.
The poor soul, beset by the same fears, seeks its confessor as judge, and feels
a torture and dismay at his condemnation that can only be realized by those who
have experienced it themselves.<note n="219" id="x.i-p16.1"><i>Ibid</i>, ch. xxx. 15.</note>&#160; For one of the severe trials of these souls,
especially if they have lived wicked lives, is their belief that God permits
them to be deceived in punishment for their sins. While actually receiving
these graces they feel secure and cannot but suppose that these favours proceed
from the Spirit of God; but this state lasts a very short time, while the remembrance
of their misdeeds is ever before them, so that when, as is sure to happen, they
discover any faults in themselves, these torturing thoughts return.<note n="220" id="x.i-p16.2"><i>Ibid</i>, ch. xxxviii. 21. <i>Rel</i>. ii. 15.</note></p>

<p id="x.i-p17">17.
The soul is quieted for a time when the confessor reassures it although it
returns later on to its former apprehensions, but when he augments its fears
they become almost unbearable. Especially is this the case when such spiritual
dryness ensues <pb n="161" id="x.i-Page_161"/>that
the mind feels as if it never had thought of God nor ever will be able to do
so. When men speak of Him, they seem to be talking of some person heard of long
ago.</p>

<p id="x.i-p18">18.
All this is nothing without the further pain of thinking we cannot make our
confessors understand the case and are deceiving them.<note n="221" id="x.i-p18.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxviii. 20 <i>sqq</i>.</note>&#160; Although such a person may examine her
conscience with the greatest care, and may know that she reveals even the first
movement of her mind to her director, it does not help her. Her understanding
being too obscure to discern the truth, she believes all that the imagination,
which now has the upper hand, puts before her mind, besides crediting the
falsehoods suggested to her by the devil, whom doubtless our Lord gives leave
to tempt her. The evil spirit even tries to make her think God has rejected
her. Many are the trials which assault this soul, causing an internal anguish
so painful and so intolerable that I can compare it to nothing save that
suffered by the lost in hell, for no comfort can be found in this tempest of trouble.<note n="222" id="x.i-p18.2">Anton. a Sp.
S. <i>l.c.</i> tr. ii. n. 313. On this
subject which is commonly called the passive purgation of the intellect, it
would be advisable to consult some good author such as Philippus a SS.
Trinitate, <i>l.c.</i> part. i. tr. iii.
disc. iii.-v., especially disc. iv. art. 5, 6.</note></p>

<p id="x.i-p19">19.
If the soul seeks for consolation from its confessor, all the demons appear to
help him to torment it more. A confessor who dealt with a person suffering in
this manner thought that her state must be very dangerous as so many things
were troubling her; therefore, after she had recovered from her trials, he bade
her tell him whenever they <pb n="162" id="x.i-Page_162"/>recurred:
however, he found this made matters worse than ever. She lost all control over
herself: although she had learnt to read, yet she could no more understand a
book in the vulgar tongue than if she had not known the alphabet, for her mind
was incapable of acting.<note n="223" id="x.i-p19.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxv. 21.</note></p>

<p id="x.i-p20">20.
In short, there is no other remedy in such a tempest except to wait for the
mercy of God Who, unexpectedly, by some casual word or unforeseen circumstance,
suddenly dispels all these sorrows; then every cloud of trouble disappears and
the mind is left full of light and far happier than before.<note n="224" id="x.i-p20.1"><i>Ibid</i>. ch. xxv. 23.</note>&#160; It praises our Lord God like one who has come
out victorious from a dangerous battle, for it was He Who won the victory. The
soul is fully conscious that the conquest was not its own as all weapons of
self-defence appeared to be in the enemies&#8217; hands. Thus it realizes its
weakness and how little man can help himself if God forsake him.</p>

<p id="x.i-p21">21.
This truth now needs no demonstration, for past experience has taught the soul
its utter incapacity; it realizes the nothingness of human nature and what
miserable creatures we are. Although in a state of grace from which it has not
fallen&#8212;for, in spite of these torments, it has not offended God, nor would it
do so for any earthly thing<note n="225" id="x.i-p21.1"><i>Ibid</i>. ch. xxiv. 3. <i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xli. 5. <i>Castle</i>,
M. vii. ch. iv. 1.</note>
&#8212;yet so hidden is this grace, that the sufferer believes that neither now, nor
in the past, has she ever possessed the faintest spark of love for 
God.<note n="226" id="x.i-p21.2"><i>Excl</i>. xvi. 4.</note>&#160; If at any time she has 
done good, or if His Majesty ever bestowed <pb n="163" id="x.i-Page_163"/>any
favours on her, they seem to have been but a dream or a fancy, while her sins
stand clearly before her.</p>

<p id="x.i-p22">22.
O Jesus! how sad it is to see a soul thus forsaken, and how little, as I said,
can any earthly comfort avail! Do not imagine, sisters, if you are ever brought
to such a state, that rich and independent people have more resources than
yourselves in these troubles. No, no! to offer such consolations would be like
setting all the joys of the world before people condemned to death: far from
mitigating, it would increase their torture. So with the souls I spoke of:
their comfort must come from above&#8212;nothing earthly can help them. This great
God wishes us to acknowledge His sovereignty and our own misery&#8212;an important
point for those who are to advance still farther.</p>

<p id="x.i-p23">23.
What can the poor soul do if such a trial lasts for many days? Prayer makes no
difference as far as comforting the heart, which no consolation can enter, nor
can the mind even grasp the meaning of the words of vocal prayer: mental prayer
is out of the question at such a time, since the faculties are unequal to it.
Solitude harms the soul, yet society or conversation is a fresh torment. Strive
as the sufferer may to hide it, she is so wearied and out of sorts with all
around that she cannot but manifest her condition.</p>

<p id="x.i-p24">24.
How can the soul possibly tell what ails it? Its pains are indescribable; it is
wrung with nameless anguish and spiritual suffering. The best remedy for these
crosses (I do not mean for gaining deliverance <pb n="164" id="x.i-Page_164"/>from
them, for I know of nothing that will do that, but for enabling one to bear
them) is to perform external works of charity and to trust in the mercy of God,
which never fails those who hope in Him.<note n="227" id="x.i-p24.1"><i>Life</i>,
ch. xxxi. 27.</note>&#160; May He be for ever blessed! Amen</p>

<p id="x.i-p25">25.
The devils also bring about exterior trials which being more unusual need not
be mentioned. They are far less painful, for whatever the demons may do, I
believe they never succeed in paralysing the faculties or disturbing the soul
in the former manner. In fact, the reason is able to discern that the evil
spirits can do no more harm than God permits; and while the mind has not lost
its powers, all sufferings are comparatively insignificant.</p>

<p id="x.i-p26">26.
I shall treat of other internal afflictions met with in this mansion when
describing the different kinds of prayer and favours bestowed here by our Lord.
Although some of these latter pains are harder to endure, as appears by their
bodily effects, yet they do not deserve the name of crosses, nor have we the
right to call them so. Indeed, they are great graces from God as the soul
recognizes amidst its pangs, realizing how far it is from meriting such graces.</p>

<p id="x.i-p27">27.
This severe torture felt by souls just at the entrance of the seventh mansion
is accompanied by many other sufferings, some of which I will mention: to speak
of them all would be impossible, nor could I portray them because they come
from another and far higher source than the rest. If I have succeeded so ill in
writing of trials of a lower kind, much less could I treat of the others. May <pb n="165" id="x.i-Page_165"/> God assist me in all
things, through the merits of His Son! Amen.</p>

<div2 title="Chapter II. The Wound of Love" progress="51.08%" prev="x.i" next="x.iii" id="x.ii">


<h3 id="x.ii-p0.1">CHAPTER
II.</h3>

<p class="Centered" id="x.ii-p1">TREATS
OF SEVERAL WAYS WHEREBY OUR LORD QUICKENS THE SOUL; THERE APPEARS NO CAUSE FOR
ALARM IN THEM ALTHOUGH THEY ARE SIGNAL FAVOURS OF A VERY EXALTED NATURE.</p>

<p class="Outline" id="x.ii-p2"><i>1. Our Lord excites the love of His spouse.
2. The wound of love. 3. The pain it causes. 4. The call of the Bridegroom. 5.
Effect on the soul. 6. A spark of the fire of love. 7. The spark dies out. 8.

14. &#8216;The odour of Thine ointment.&#8217; 15. No reason to fear deception here</i>.</p>

<p id="x.ii-p3">1.
IT seems as if we had deserted the little dove for a long time, but this is not
the case, for these past trials cause her to take a far higher flight. I will
now describe the way in which the Spouse treats her before uniting her entirely
to Himself. He increases her longing for Him by devices so delicate that the
soul itself cannot discern them; nor do I think I could explain them except to
people who have personally experienced them. These desires are delicate and
subtle impulses springing from the inmost depths of the soul; I know of nothing
to which they can be compared.</p>

<p id="x.ii-p4">2.
These graces differ entirely from anything we ourselves can gain, and even from
the spiritual consolation before described.<note n="228" id="x.ii-p4.1">Mansion iv. ch. i. <i>Life</i>, ch. xxix. 10-15. <i>Rel</i>. ch. viii. 15.</note>&#160; In the present case, even when the mind is
not recollected or even thinking of God, although no sound is heard, His <pb n="166" id="x.ii-Page_166"/> Majesty arouses it
suddenly as if by a swiftly flashing comet or by a clap of thunder.<note n="229" id="x.ii-p4.2">The saint
first wrote &#8216;relampago,&#8217; flash of lightning, but afterwards altered it to
&#8217;trueno,&#8217; clap of thunder.</note>&#160; Yet the soul thus called by God hears Him
well enough&#8212;so well, indeed, that sometimes, especially at first, it trembles
and even cries out, although it feels no pain. It is conscious of having
received a delicious wound but cannot discover how, nor who gave it, yet
recognizes it as a most precious grace and hopes the hurt will never heal.</p>

<p id="x.ii-p5">3.
The soul makes amorous complaints to its Bridegroom, even uttering them aloud;
nor can it control itself, knowing that though He is present He will not
manifest Himself so that it may enjoy Him. This causes a pain, keen although
sweet and delicious from which the soul could not escape even if it wished; but
this it never desires.<note n="230" id="x.ii-p5.1"><i>Rel</i>. viii. 16. St. John of the Cross, <i>Spiritual Cant</i>. st. i. 22 <i>sqq</i>. <i>Poems</i>
7, 8.</note>&#160; This favour is more delightful than the
pleasing absorption of the faculties in the prayer of quiet which is
unaccompanied by suffering.<note n="231" id="x.ii-p5.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxix. 18.</note></p>

<p id="x.ii-p6">4.
I am at my wits&#8217; end, sisters, as to how to make you understand this operation
of love: I know not how to do so. It seems contradictory to say that the
Beloved clearly shows He dwells in the soul and calls by so unmistakable a sign
and a summons so penetrating, that the spirit cannot choose but hear it, while
He appears to reside in the seventh mansion. He speaks in this manner, which is
not a set form of speech, and the inhabitants of the other <pb n="167" id="x.ii-Page_167"/>mansions,
the senses, the imagination and the faculties, dare not stir.<note n="232" id="x.ii-p6.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xv. 1.</note>
</p>

<p id="x.ii-p7">5.
O Almighty God! how profound are Thy secrets and how different are spiritual
matters from anything that can be seen or heard in this world! I can find
nothing to which to liken these graces, insignificant as they are compared with
many others Thou dost bestow on souls. This favour acts so strongly upon the
spirit that it is consumed by desires yet knows not what to ask, for it
realizes clearly that its God is with it. You may inquire, if it realizes this
so clearly, what more does it desire and why is it pained? What greater good
can it seek? I cannot tell: I know that this suffering seems to pierce the very
heart, and when He Who wounded it draws out the dart He seems to draw the heart
out too, so deep is the love it feels.<note n="233" id="x.ii-p7.1"><i>Ibid</i>.
ch. xxix. 17, 18.</note>
</p>

<p id="x.ii-p8">6.
I have been thinking that God might be likened to a burning furnace<note n="234" id="x.ii-p8.1"><i>Ibid</i>. ch. xv, 6; xviii. 4.; xxi. 9.</note>&#160; from which a small spark flies into the soul
that feels the heat of this great fire, which, however, is insufficient to
consume it. The sensation is so delightful that the spirit lingers in the pain
produced by its contact. This seems to me the best comparison I can find, for
the pain is delicious and is not really pain at all, nor does it always
continue in the same degree; sometimes it lasts for a long time; on other
occasions it passes quickly. This is as God chooses, for no human means can
obtain it; and though felt at times for a long while, yet it is
intermittent.</p>

<p id="x.ii-p9"> <pb n="168" id="x.ii-Page_168"/>7.
In fact it is never permanent and therefore does not wholly inflame the spirit;
but when the soul is ready to take fire, the little spark suddenly dies out,
leaving the heart longing to suffer anew its loving pangs. No grounds exist for
thinking this comes from any natural cause or from melancholy, or that it is an
illusion of the devil or the imagination. Undoubtedly this movement of the
heart comes from God Who is unchangeable; nor do its effects is resemble those
of other devotions in which the strong absorption of delight makes us doubt
their reality.</p>

<p id="x.ii-p10">8.
There is no suspension here of the senses or other faculties: they wonder at
what is happening, without impeding it. Nor do I think that they can either
increase or dispel this delightful pain. Any one who has received this favour
from our Lord will understand my meaning on reading this: let her thank Him
fervently: there is no need to fear deception but far more fear of not being
sufficiently grateful for so signal a grace. Let her endeavour to serve Him and
to amend her life in every respect; then she will see what will follow and how
she will obtain still higher and higher gifts.</p>

<p id="x.ii-p11">9.
A person on whom this grace was bestowed passed several years without receiving
any other favour, yet was perfectly satisfied, for even had she served God for
very many years in the midst of severe trials, she would have felt abundantly
repaid. May He be for ever blessed! Amen.</p>

<p id="x.ii-p12">10.
Perhaps you wonder why we may feel more secure against deception concerning
this favour <pb n="169" id="x.ii-Page_169"/>than
in other cases. I think it is for these reasons. Firstly, because the devil
cannot give such delicious pain: he may cause pleasure or delight which appears
spiritual but is unable to add suffering, especially suffering of so keen a
sort, united to peace and joy of soul. His power is limited to what is
external; suffering produced by him is never accompanied with peace, but with
anxieties and struggles.</p>

<p id="x.ii-p13">11.
Secondly, because this welcome storm comes from no region over which Satan has
control. Thirdly, because of the great benefits left in the soul which, as a
rule, is resolute to suffer for God and longs to bear many crosses. It is also
far more determined than before to withdraw from worldly pleasures and
intercourse and other things of the same sort.</p>

<p id="x.ii-p14">12.
It is very clear that this is no fiction: the imagination may counterfeit some
favours but not this, which is too manifest to leave room for doubt. Should any
one still remain uncertain, let her know that hers were not genuine impulses;<note n="235" id="x.ii-p14.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xv. 15, 16.</note>&#160; that is, if she is dubious as to whether or
no she experienced them, for they are as certainly perceived by the soul as is
a loud voice by the ears. It is impossible for these experiences to proceed
from melancholy whose whims arise and exist only in the imagination, whereas
this emotion comes from the interior of the soul.</p>

<p id="x.ii-p15">13.
I may be mistaken, but I shall not change my opinion until I hear reasons to
the contrary from <pb n="170" id="x.ii-Page_170"/>those
who understand these matters. I know some one who has always greatly dreaded
such deceptions, yet could never bring herself to feel any alarm about this
state of prayer.<note n="236" id="x.ii-p15.1">Life,
ch. xxix. 6-10.</note>
</p>

<p id="x.ii-p16">14.
Our Lord also uses other means of rousing the soul; for instance&#8212;when reciting
vocal prayer without seeking to penetrate the sense, a person may be seized
with a delightful fervour<note n="237" id="x.ii-p16.1"><i>Ibid</i>. ch. xv. 12. On the matter treated
by St. Teresa in this chapter, compare St. John of the Cross, <i>Spiritual Canticle</i>, stanza i. (<i>circa finem</i>), stanza ix.; <i>The Living Flame of Love</i>, stanza ii.</note>&#160; as if suddenly encompassed with a fragrance
powerful enough to diffuse itself through all the senses. I do not assert that
there really is any perfume but use this comparison because it somewhat
resembles the manner by which the Spouse makes His presence understood, moving
the soul to a delicious desire of enjoying Him and thus disposing it to heroic
acts, and causing it to render Him fervent praise.</p>

<p id="x.ii-p17">15.
This favour springs from the same source as the former, but causes no suffering
here, nor are the soul&#8217;s longings to enjoy God painful: this is what is more
usually experienced by the soul. For the reasons already given there appears no
cause here for fear, but rather for receiving it with thanksgiving.</p>

<h3 id="x.iii-p0.1">INTRODUCTORY
NOTE TO CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h6 style="text-align:center" id="x.iii-p0.2">BY
THE EDITOR</h6>

<p id="x.iii-p1">THE
readers, especially those not well acquainted with Scholastic philosophy, will,
perhaps, be glad to find here a short explanation of the various kinds. of
Vision and Locution, Corporal, Imaginary, and Intellectual. The senses of
Taste, Touch, and Smell are not so often affected by mystical phenomena, but
what we are about to say in respect of Sight and Hearing applies, mutatis
mutandis, to these also.</p>

<p id="x.iii-p2">1.
A CORPORAL VISION is when one sees a bodily object. A Corporal Locution is when
one hears words uttered by a human tongue. In both cases the respective senses
are exercising their normal function, and the phenomenon differs from ordinary
seeing or hearing merely by the fact that in the latter the object seen is a
real body, the words perceived come from a real tongue, whereas in the Vision
or Locution the object is either only apparent or at any rate is not such as it
seems to be. Thus, when young Tobias set out on a journey, his companion,
Azarias, was not a real human being, but an archangel in human form. Tobias did
really see and hear him, and felt the grip of his hand; Sara and her parents,
as well as Tobias&#8217;s parents, saw and heard him too, but all the time the
archangel made himself visible and audible by means of an assumed body, or
perhaps of an apparent body. It would be more correct to describe such a
phenomenon as an APPARITION than as a Vision, and in fact the apparitions of
our Risen Lord to the holy women and the apostles belong to this category. For,
though His was a real body, it was glorified and therefore no longer subject to
the same laws which govern purely human things. (St. Thomas, <i>Summa theol</i>. III., qu. 54, art. I-3).</p>

<p id="x.iii-p3">St.
Teresa tells us more than once that she never <pb n="172" id="x.iii-Page_172"/>beheld
a Corporal Vision, nor heard a Corporal Locution.</p>

<p id="x.iii-p4">II.
AN IMAGINARY VISION OR LOCUTION is one where nothing is seen or heard by the
senses of seeing or hearing, but where the same impression is received that
would be produced upon the imagination by the senses if some real object were
perceived by them. For, according to the Scholastics, the Imagination stands
half-way between the senses and the intellect, receiving impressions from the
former and transmitting them to the latter. This is the reason why imaginary
Visions and Locutions are so dangerous that, according to St. Teresa, St. John
of the Cross, and other spiritual writers, they should not only never be sought
for, but as much as possible shunned and under all circumstances
discountenanced. For the Imagination is closely connected with the Memory, so
that it is frequently impossible to ascertain whether a Vision, etc., is not
perhaps a semi-conscious or unconscious reproduction of scenes witnessed. It is
here also that deception, wilful or unwilful, self-deception or deception by a
higher agency, is to be feared. Hence the general rule that such Visions or
Locutions should only be trusted upon the strongest grounds. According to St.
Thomas Aquinas, (<i>Summa theol. IIa II&#230;</i>,
gu. 175, art. 3 ad q.) the visions of Isaias, St. John in the Apocalypse etc.,
were Imaginary.</p>

<p id="x.iii-p5">As
an example of Imaginary Visions we may mention St. Stephen, who saw &#8216;the
heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God&#8217;; or St.
Peter, who saw &#8216;the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it were
a great linen sheet, let down by the four corners from heaven to the earth . .
. and there came a voice to him: Arise, Peter, kill and eat.&#8217; (Acts, vii. 55;
X. 11-13).</p>

<p id="x.iii-p6">These
Visions, Locutions, etc., are not hallucinations. The latter are due to
physical disorder which affects the memory and causes it to represent
impressions formerly received by it, in a disorderly and often grotesque
manner. The Imaginary Vision takes place independently of a <pb n="173" id="x.iii-Page_173"/>morbid
state, is caused by an extraneous power, good or evil, and has for its object
things of which the memory neither has nor ever has had cognizance.</p>

<p id="x.iii-p7">III.
AN INTELLECTUAL VISION OR LOCUTION is one where nothing is seen or heard by the
eyes and ears, and where no sensation is received by the imagination. But the
impression which would be delivered by the imagination to the intellect, had it
come through the senses and been handed on to the imagination, is directly
imprinted upon the intellect. To understand this it is necessary to bear in
mind that the impressions we receive through the senses must undergo a
transformation&#8212;must be spiritualized&#8212;before they reach the intellect. This is
one of the most difficult problems of psychology; none of the solutions offered
by various schools of philosophy seem to render it entirely free from
obscurity. According to St. Thomas Aquinas, the impression received by the eye
(<i>Species sensibilis</i>) is spiritualized
by a faculty called <i>Intellectus agens</i>
by means of abstraction (<i>Species impressa</i>),
and is treasured up in the memory, like lantern slides, available at demand.
The mind, identifying itself with the Species impressa, produces the &#8216;Word of
the mind&#8217; (<i>Verbum mentis</i>), wherein
consists the act of Understanding or Mental Conception. In the Intellectual
Vision or Locution, God, without co-operation on the part of the senses, the
imagination, or the memory, produces directly on the mind the <i>Species impressa</i>. As this is
supernatural with regard to its origin, and often also with respect to its
object, it stands to reason that it is too exalted for the memory to receive
it, so that such Visions and Locutions are frequently only imperfectly
remembered and sometimes altogether forgotten, as St. Teresa tells us. On the
other hand they are far less dangerous than Corporal or Imaginary Visions and
Locutions, because the senses and imagination have nothing to do with them,
whilst evil spirits are unable to act directly upon the mind, and self-deception
is altogether excluded for the reasons stated by St. Teresa. <pb n="174" id="x.iii-Page_174"/>An
instance of such a vision is mentioned by St. Paul: &#8216;I know a man in Christ
above fourteen years ago (whether in the body I know not, or out of the body I
know not: God knoweth), such an one rapt even to the third heaven. And I know
such a man (whether in the body or out of the body, I know not: God knoweth):
that he was caught up into paradise, and heard secret words, which it is not

<p id="x.iv-p3">1.
GOD arouses the soul in another manner which, though in some ways apparently a
greater favour than the above mentioned, yet may prove more dangerous,
therefore I will give some particulars about it. He does this by means of words
addressed to the soul in many different ways; sometimes they appear to come
from without; at other times <pb n="175" id="x.iv-Page_175"/>from
the inner depths of the soul; or again, from its superior part; while other
speeches are so exterior as to be heard by the ears like a real voice.</p>

<p id="x.iv-p4">2.
At times, indeed very often, this may be only a fancy; especially with persons
of a lively imagination or who are afflicted with melancholy to any marked
extent. I think that no attention should be paid to either class of people when
they say they see, hear, or learn anything supernaturally. Do not disturb them
by saying that it comes from the devil,<note n="238" id="x.iv-p4.1"><i>Life</i>,
ch. xxiii. 114.</note>&#160; but listen to them as if they were sick
persons. Let the prioress or confessor to whom they tell their story bid them
think no more of it as such matters are not essential in the service of God:
the devil has deceived many Christians thus, although perhaps it is not so in their
case; therefore they need not trouble themselves about it. Thus we must
accomodate ourselves to their humour: if we tell them their fancies proceed
from melancholia, there will be no end to the matter, for they will persist in
maintaining they have seen and heard these things, for so it seems to them.</p>

<p id="x.iv-p5">3.
The truth is, care should be taken to keep such people from too much prayer and
to persuade them, as far as possible, to take no notice of their fancies: the
devil makes use of these weak souls to injure others, even if they themselves
escape unhurt. There is need for caution both with feeble and strong souls at
first, until it is certain from what spirit these things proceed. I maintain
that, in the beginning, it is always wiser to resist these <pb n="176" id="x.iv-Page_176"/>communications;
if they come from God this is the best way to receive more, for they increase
when discouraged. At the same time the soul should not be too strictly
controlled or disquieted, for it cannot help itself in the matter.</p>

<p id="x.iv-p6">4.
To return to discuss the words addressed to the soul: any kind I mentioned may
come either from God, the devil, or the imagination. By the help of God I will
endeavour to describe the signs distinguishing the one from the other, and when
these locutions are dangerous, for they occur to many persons who praise
prayer. I do not wish you to think, sisters, that there is any harm either in
believing or in disregarding them. When they only console you, or warn you of
your faults, it matters not whence they come or whether they are only fancies.</p>

<p id="x.iv-p7">5.
I caution you on one point&#8212;although they may come from God, you must not
esteem yourself more highly, for He often spoke to the Pharisees<note n="239" id="x.iv-p7.1">Antonius a
Sp. S. <i>l.c.</i> tr. iii. n. 323. St. John
of the Cross, <i>Ascent of Mount Carmel</i>,
bk. ii. ch. xxvii.</note>
&#8212;all the good consists in profiting by His words. Take no more notice of any
speeches you hear which disagree with the Holy Scriptures than if you heard
them from Satan himself. Though they may only rise from your vivid imagination,
look upon them as a temptation against the faith. Always resist them; then they
will leave you, and cease, for they have little strength of their own.<note n="240" id="x.iv-p7.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxv. 13, 18.</note></p>

<p id="x.iv-p8">6.
Now let us return to the first point&#8212;whether these communications come from
the inferior or <pb n="177" id="x.iv-Page_177"/>the
superior part of the soul, or from without, does not affect their originating
from God.</p>

<p id="x.iv-p9">7.
In my opinion these are the most certain signs of their being divine. The first
and truest is the power and authority they carry with them, for these words are
operative.<note n="241" id="x.iv-p9.1"><scripRef passage="Ps. cxlviii. 5" id="x.iv-p9.2" parsed="|Ps|148|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.148.5">Ps.
cxlviii. 5</scripRef>: &#8216;Ipse dixit et facta
sunt.&#8217; <i>Life</i>, ch. xxv. 5. Anton. a Sp.
S. <i>l.c.</i> tr. iii. n. 353. St.
John of the Cross, <i>Ascent of Mount Carmel</i>,
bk. ii. ch. xxxi. calls these &#8216;substantial words.&#8217;</note>&#160; For example: a soul is suffering all the
sorrow and disquiet I have described: the mind is darkened and dry; but it is
set at peace, freed from all trouble and filled with light merely by hearing
the words: &#8216;Be not troubled.&#8217; These deliver it from all its pains, although it
felt as though, if the whole world and all its theologians had united in trying
to persuade it there was no cause for grief, it could not, in spite of all
their efforts, have been delivered from its affliction.<note n="242" id="x.iv-p9.3"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxvi. 6; xxx. 17. <i>Rel</i>.
i. 26.</note>
</p>

<p id="x.iv-p10">8.
Again, a person is troubled and greatly terrified at being told by her
confessor and other people that her soul is under the influence of the evil
one: she hears a single sentence which says, &#8216;It is I, be not afraid,&#8217;<note n="243" id="x.iv-p10.1">St. <scripRef passage="Luke xxiv. 36" id="x.iv-p10.2" parsed="|Luke|24|36|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.24.36">Luke
xxiv. 36</scripRef>.</note>&#160; and is at once freed from all fears and
filled with consolation; indeed, she believes it would be impossible for any
one to disturb her confidence.<note n="244" id="x.iv-p10.3"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxv. 22; xxxiii. 10. <i>Rel</i>. vii. 22. St. John of the Cross, <i>Ascent of Mount Carmel</i>, bk. ii. ch.
xxxi. 1.</note>
</p>

<p id="x.iv-p11">9.
Again, when exceedingly anxious about important business, not knowing whether
or not it will be successful, on hearing words bidding her <pb n="178" id="x.iv-Page_178"/> &#8216;Be at peace; all will go well,&#8217; she
feels reassured and free from all care in the matter.<note n="245" id="x.iv-p11.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxxv. 7. <i>Rel</i>.
ix. 6. St. John of the Cross, <i>Ascent of
Mount Carmel</i>, bk. iii. ch. ii. 7.</note>&#160; Many
other instances of the same sort could be mentioned.</p>

<p id="x.iv-p12">10.
The second sign is a great calm and a devout and peaceful recollection which
dwell in the soul together with a desire to praise God. They say that
communications, at any rate in this mansion, are not uttered direly by God but
are transmitted by an angel.<note n="246" id="x.iv-p12.1"><i>Rel</i>. v. 14.</note>&#160; Then, O my God, if a word sent to us by Thee
through Thy messenger has such force, what effects wilt Thou not leave in the
soul united to Thee in a mutual bond of love?<note n="247" id="x.iv-p12.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxv. 23-25. See also Schram, <i>Instit. theol. myst</i>. 528 schol.; 529 schol. ii. and iii.; 5 3 I
schol. ii.; 5 32 schol. ii. Exterior locutions may proceed direct from God, but
generally are due to the ministry of angels; the same holds good with regard to
the imaginary ones. Intellectual locutions, in which the words are merely
impressed upon the substance of the soul without intervention of the
imagination, can only proceed from God, Who alone is able to act upon the
substance of the soul. See also Life, ch. xxvii. 7 (end), 8, 9, and 10, and the
corresponding chapters in St. John&#8217;s <i>Ascent
of Mount Carmel</i>.</note>
</p>

<p id="x.iv-p13">11.
The third proof is that these words do not pass from the memory but remain
there for a very long time; sometimes they are never forgotten. This is not the
case with what <i>men</i> may utter, which,
however grave and learned they may be, is not thus impressed on our memory.
Neither, if they prophesy of things to come, do we believe them as we do these
divine locutions which leave us so convinced of their truth that, although
their fulfilment sometimes seems utterly impossible and we vacillate and doubt
about them, there still <pb n="179" id="x.iv-Page_179"/>remains
in the soul a certainty of their verity which cannot be destroyed. Perhaps
everything may seem to militate against what was heard and years pass by, yet
the spirit never loses its belief that God will make use of means unknown to
men for the purpose and that finally what was foretold must surely happen; as
indeed it does.<note n="248" id="x.iv-p13.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxv. 3, 10. <i>Rel</i>. ii. 17.</note></p>

<p id="x.iv-p14">12.
Still, as I said, the soul is troubled at seeing many obstacles in the way of
the accomplishment of the prophecy. The words, their effects, and the assurance
they carry with them convinced the soul at the moment that they came from God.
Afterwards, however, doubts arise as to whether the locutions came from the
devil or from the imagination, although while hearing them the person would
have died to defend their truth.<note n="249" id="x.iv-p14.1"><i>Ibid</i>, ch. xxv. 10.</note>&#160; But, as I said, these misgivings must be
suggested by the evil one to afflict and intimidate her, especially if by
carrying out a command thus given great good will result to souls and some work
be done conducing notably to the honour and service of God, concerning which
great difficulties have to be overcome. In such cases, where will Satan stop
short? At least, he weakens faith, and it is a terrible evil to doubt that God
has power to work in a way far beyond our understanding.</p>

<p id="x.iv-p15">13.
Despite all these difficulties and although the confessors consulted on these
matters say the words were but fancies, while events take such an unfavourable
turn as to make the realization of these predictions seem impossible, yet there
remains so <pb n="180" id="x.iv-Page_180"/>lively
a spark of certainty in the mind (I know not whence it comes) that, although
all other hopes die out, it cannot, if it would, quench this ardent spark of
confidence. At last, as I said, our Lord&#8217;s words are accomplished, at which the
soul is so satisfied and joyful that it can do nothing but praise His
Majesty&#8212;more because it sees His words prove true than on account of the thing
itself, even though it may be of consequence to the person concerned.</p>

<p id="x.iv-p16">14.
I know not why the soul attaches such importance to these communications being
verified. I think that if the person herself were detected in telling
falsehoods, she would not be so grieved as at these locutions proving
untrue&#8212;as if she could do anything in the matter beyond repeating what has
been said to her! A certain person was frequently reminded in such a case of
the Prophet Jonas, when he found Ninive was not to be destroyed.<note n="250" id="x.iv-p16.1">Jonas iv. 1:
&#8217;Et afflictus est Jonas afflictione magna et iratus est; et oravit ad Dominum
et dixit: Obsecro, Domine, numquid non hoc est verbum meum cum adhuc essem in
terra mea?&#8217;</note>
</p>

<p id="x.iv-p17">15.
In fact, as these words come from the Spirit of God, it is right thus to trust
them and to desire that He Who is supreme truth should not be thought a
deceiver. Justly, therefore, does their hearer rejoice when, after a thousand
delays and enormous difficulties, they are accomplished. Although this success
may entail great suffering on herself, she prefers it to the nonfulfilment of
what she knows our Lord most certainly foretold. Possibly every one is not so
weak as this, if indeed it <pb n="181" id="x.iv-Page_181"/>is
a weakness, though I cannot myself condemn it as an evil.</p>

<p id="x.iv-p18">16.
If these locutions proceed from the imagination<note n="251" id="x.iv-p18.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxv. 4 (end) and 5 (beginning).</note>&#160; they show no such signs, bringing neither
conviction, peace, nor interior joy with them. But in some cases I have come
across, on account of a very weak constitution or vivid imagination or of other
causes I do not know, persons while absorbed in the prayer of quiet and in
spiritual slumber are so entirely carried out of themselves by their deep state
of recollection as to be unconscious of anything external. All their senses
being thus dormant, as if asleep&#8212;as indeed, at times they really are&#8212;they
thus, in a sort of dream, fancy they are spoken to or see things they imagine
come from God, but which leave no more effect than dreams.</p>

<p id="x.iv-p19">17.
Again, one who very lovingly asks something of our Lord may fancy that an
answer comes from Him.<note n="252" id="x.iv-p19.1"><i>Ibid</i>. ch. xxv. 4 (beginning).</note>&#160; This often occurs, but I think that no one
accustomed to receive divine communications could be deceived on this point by
the imagination.</p>

<p id="x.iv-p20">18.
The devil&#8217;s deceptions are more dangerous; but if the foregoing signs are
present, we may feel fairly confident that these locutions are from God, though
not so certain but that, if they refer to some weighty matter in which we are
called upon to act or if they concern a third person, we should consult some
confessor who is both learned and a servant of God, before attempting or
thinking of acting on them, although we may have heard them repeated several
times and are convinced of their <pb n="182" id="x.iv-Page_182"/>truth
and divine origin.<note n="253" id="x.iv-p20.1"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xxxix. 6. <i>Life</i>, ch. xxvi. 4, 5. St. John of the
Cross, <i>Ascent of Mount Carmel</i>, bk.
ii. ch. xxii. 14-18.</note>&#160; His Majesty wishes us to take this course; it
is not disobedience to His commands, for He has bidden us hold our confessor as
His representative even where there is no doubt that the communications come
from Him: thus we shall gain courage if the matter is a very difficult one. Our
Lord will reassure our confessor, whom, when He so chooses, He will inspire
with faith that these locutions are from the Holy Ghost.<note n="254" id="x.iv-p20.2"><i>Rel</i>. vii. 15.</note>&#160; If not, we are freed from all further
obligations in the matter. I think it would be very dangerous to act against
our confessor&#8217;s advice and to prefer our own opinions in such a matter.
Therefore, sisters, I admonish you in the name of our Lord, never to do
anything of the sort.</p>

<p id="x.iv-p21">19.
God speaks to the soul in another way by a certain intellectual vision which I
think undoubtedly proceeds from Him; it will be described later on.<note n="255" id="x.iv-p21.1"><i>Infra</i>, ch. viii.</note> 8 It takes place far
within the innermost depths of the soul which appears to hear distinctly in a
most mysterious manner, with its spiritual hearing, the words spoken to it by
our Lord Himself. The way in which the spirit perceives these words and the
results produced by them, convince us that they cannot in any way come from the
devil. Their powerful aftereffects force us to admit this and plainly show they
do not spring from the imagination.<note n="256" id="x.iv-p21.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxvii, 8.</note>&#160; Careful consideration will assure us of this
for the following reasons;&#8212;</p>

<p id="x.iv-p22">20.
Firstly, the clearness of the language varies <pb n="183" id="x.iv-Page_183"/>in
the different kinds of locutions. Those that are divine are so distinct that
the hearer remembers if there were a syllable missing, and what words were made
use of even though a whole sentence was spoken. But if the speech were only a
freak of fancy, it would not be so audible nor would the words be so distinct
but would be only half articulated.<note n="257" id="x.iv-p22.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxv. 6 and 10 (end).</note></p>

<p id="x.iv-p23">21.
The second reason is that often the person was not thinking of what is heard;
sometimes the locution even comes unexpectedly during conversation, though at
times it refers to some thought that passed quickly through the mind or to a
subject it was before engaged upon. Frequently it concerns things of whose
existence the hearer knew nothing nor even imagined such events could ever come
to pass; therefore it is impossible for the imagination to have framed such
speeches and deceived the mind by fancies about what it had never wished, nor
sought for, nor even thought about.<note n="258" id="x.iv-p23.1"><i>Ibid</i>. ch. xxv. 9, 16.</note></p>

<p id="x.iv-p24">22.
The third reason is that in a genuine case the soul seems to listen to the
words, whereas when the imagination is at work, little by little it composes
what the person wishes to hear.<note n="259" id="x.iv-p24.1"><i>Ibid</i>. ch. xxv. 4, 6.</note></p>

<p id="x.iv-p25">23.
The fourth reason is because divine locutions differ immensely from others, a
single word comprising a depth of meaning which our understanding could not
thus quickly condense into one phrase.<note n="260" id="x.iv-p25.1"><i>Ibid</i>,
ch. xxv. 12 (beginning).</note>
</p>

<p id="x.iv-p26">24.
Fifthly because, in a manner I cannot explain, these communications, without
any further explanations, frequently give us to understand far <pb n="184" id="x.iv-Page_184"/>more
than is implied by the words themselves. I shall speak farther on of this way
of understanding hidden things which is very subtle and a favour for which we
should thank God. Some people are exceedingly suspicious about these and other
communications of the same kind. I speak particularly of some one<note n="261" id="x.iv-p26.1">The whole of
this chapter as well as chapter xxv. of the <i>Life</i>
prove clearly that the Saint speaks about herself and that she investigated the
subject with the greatest care.</note>&#160; who experienced them herself, though there
may be others who cannot understand them. I know that she has considered the subject
very carefully, God having often bestowed this grace on her. Her principal
difficulty was to discover whether the locutions were merely fancied. It is
easier to know when they come from the devil although being so wily, he can
with facility imitate the spirit of light. However, he would do this in a form
of words pronounced so distinctly that there would be no more doubt as to their
reality than if they came from the spirit of truth, while those coming from the
imagination leave us uncertain whether we heard the words or not. But Satan
could never counterfeit the effects I spoke of;<note n="262" id="x.iv-p26.2">Life, ch. xxv. 15.</note>&#160; he leaves neither peace nor light in the
soul, only anxiety and confusion. In any case, he can do little or no harm to
one who is humble and who, as I advised, does not act on what is heard.</p>

<p id="x.iv-p27">25.
If the soul receives favours and caresses from our Lord, let it examine
carefully whether it rates itself more highly in consequence; unless
self-abasement increases with God&#8217;s expressions of love, <pb n="185" id="x.iv-Page_185"/>they
do not come from the Holy Spirit. Inevitably, when they are divine, the greater
the favours, the less the soul esteems itself and the more keenly it remembers
its sins.<note n="263" id="x.iv-p27.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xii. 5: &#8216;The nearer we draw
unto God the more this virtue (humility) should grow&#8217;; xv. 16; xix. 2; xx. 38. <i>Rel</i>. ii. 15; vii. 17; viii. 7, 9. <i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xvii. 3.</note>&#160; It becomes more oblivious of self-interest:
the will and memory grow more fervent in seeking solely God&#8217;s honour with no
thought of self. It also becomes unceasingly careful not to deviate
deliberately from the will of God and feels a keener conviction that instead of
meriting such favours, it deserves hell.</p>

<p id="x.iv-p28">26.
When these results follow, no graces or gifts received during prayer need alarm
the soul which should rather trust in the mercy of God, Who is faithful and
will not allow the devil to deceive it; but it is always well to be on one&#8217;s
guard.</p>

<p id="x.iv-p29">27.
Those our Lord does not lead by this path may suppose that the soul can avoid
listening to these locutions and that even if they are interior it is at least
possible to distract the attention from them so as not to hear them and thus
escape danger. This cannot be done: I am not speaking of freaks of fancy which
may be prevented by ceasing to desire certain things or by paying no attention
to its inventions. This is not feasible when these communications come from the
Holy Ghost Who, when He speaks, stops all other thoughts and compels the mind
to listen.<note n="264" id="x.iv-p29.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxv. 21.</note>&#160; Mark this: that I believe it would be easier
for a person with very keen ears to avoid hearing a loud voice, for he could
occupy <pb n="186" id="x.iv-Page_186"/>his
thoughts and mind in other things. Not so here; the soul can do nothing, nor
has it ears to stop, nor power to think of aught but what is said to it. For He
Who could stay the sun on its course (at the prayer of Josue,<note n="265" id="x.iv-p29.2">Josue x. 12. 13: &#8216;Tunc
locutus est Josue: . . . sol contra Gabaon ne movearis; steteruntque sol et
luna.&#8217;</note>&#160; I believe) can so quiet the faculties and the
interior of the spirit as to make it perceive that another and a stronger Lord
than itself governs this castle; it is thus affected with profound devotion and
humility, seeing that it cannot but listen. May the divine Majesty vouchsafe
that, forgetting ourselves, our only aim may be to please Him, as I said. Amen.
God grant I have succeeded in explaining what I wished and that it may be some
guide to those who may experience such favours.</p>

WHAT rest can the poor little butterfly find, with all the trials I have told
you of and many more? They serve to make her desire the Bride-groom more
ardently. His Majesty, well aware of our weakness, fortifies her by these and
other means in order that she may obtain courage for union with a Lord so great
and may take Him for her Spouse. Perhaps you will laugh and think I am talking
foolishly: there can be no call for courage here; there is no woman, however
low her class, who would not dare to wed a king. So I think, were he an earthly
monarch, but there is need of more fortitude than you suppose in order to
espouse the King of heaven.<note n="266" id="x.v-p4.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxxix. 30.</note>&#160; Our nature appears too timid and base for
anything so high; without doubt, unless God gave us the grace it would be <pb n="188" id="x.v-Page_188"/>impossible
for us, however much we might appreciate its benefits. You will learn how His
Majesty ratifies these espousals; probably this is done when He ravishes the
soul by ecstasies, thus depriving it of its faculties; if the use of these were
retained, I think the sight of its close vicinity to so mighty a Sovereign
would probably deprive the body of life. I am speaking of genuine raptures, not
fancies that come from women&#8217;s weakness&#8212;which so often occur nowadays&#8212;making
them imagine everything to be a rapture or an ecstasy. As I think I said, some
are so feebly constituted as to die of a single prayer of quiet.<note n="267" id="x.v-p4.2"><i>Castle</i>, M. iv. ch. iii. 11.</note></p>

<p id="x.v-p5">2.
I should like to describe here several kinds of raptures of which I have learnt
from spiritual persons with whom I have discussed the subject, but I am not
sure whether I shall succeed in explaining them as I did elsewhere.<note n="268" id="x.v-p5.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xx. <i>passim</i>.</note>&#160; It has been decided that it will not be amiss
to repeat what was said about these and other things that happen in this state,
if only that I may treat of all the mansions contain in proper order.</p>

<p id="x.v-p6">3.
In one sort of rapture the soul, although perhaps not engaged in prayer at the
time, is struck by some word of God which it either remembers or hears.<note n="269" id="x.v-p6.1">Philippus a
SS. Trinitate, <i>l.c.</i> tr. i. disc. iii.
art. 3.</note>&#160; His Majesty, touched with pity by what He has
seen it suffer for so long past in its longing for Him, appears to increase the
spark I described in the interior of the spirit until it entirely inflames the
soul which rises with new life like a phoenix from the flames. Such a one may
piously believe <pb n="189" id="x.v-Page_189"/>her
sins are now forgiven,<note n="270" id="x.v-p6.2"><i>Rel</i>. ix. 4. <i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xix. 8.</note>&#160;
supposing that she is in the disposition and has made use of the means
required by the Church. The soul being thus purified, God unites it to Himself
in a way known only to Him and the spirit, nor does even the latter so
understand what happens as to be able to explain it to others afterwards. Yet
the mind had not lost the use of its faculties, for this ecstasy does not
resemble a swoon or a fit in which nothing either interior or exterior is felt.</p>

<p id="x.v-p7">4.
What I do understand is that the soul has never been more alive to spiritual
things nor so full of light and of knowledge of His Majesty as it is now. This
might seem impossible; if the powers and senses were so absorbed that we might
call them dead, how does the soul understand this mystery? I cannot tell;
perhaps no one but the Creator Himself can say what passes in these places&#8212;I
mean this and the following mansions which may be treated as one, the door
leading from one to the other being wide open. However, as some things in the
last rooms are only shown to those who get thus far, I thought it better to
treat the mansions separately.</p>

<p id="x.v-p8">5.
While the soul is in this suspension, our Lord favours it by discovering to it
secrets such as heavenly mysteries and imaginary visions, which admit of
description afterwards because they remain so imprinted on the memory that it
never forgets them. But when the visions are intellectual they are not thus
easily related, some of those received at such <pb n="190" id="x.v-Page_190"/>a
time being so sublime that it is not fitting for man, while living in this
world, to understand them in a way that can be told, although when the use of
the faculties returns much can be described of what was seen in intellectual
vision. Possibly you do not know what a vision is, especially an intellectual
one. Since I have been bidden by one who has authority, I will tell you at the
proper time. Although seemingly superfluous, it may prove useful to certain
people.</p>

<p id="x.v-p9">6.
&#8217;But,&#8217; you will ask me, &#8216;if the very sublime favours our Lord bestows in this
mansion cannot afterwards be remembered, what profit do they bring?&#8217;<note n="271" id="x.v-p9.1">Philippus a
SS. Trinitate, <i>l.c</i>.</note>&#160; O daughters! their value cannot be overrated;
for though the recipient is incapable of describing them, they are deeply
imprinted in the centre of the soul and are never forgotten. &#8216;How can they be
remembered if no image is seen and the powers of the soul do not comprehend them?&#8217;
I, too, do not understand this, but I know that certain truths of the greatness
of God remain so impressed on the spirit by this favour that, did not faith
teach Who He is and that it is bound to believe He is God, the soul would
henceforth worship Him as such, as did Jacob when he saw the ladder.<note n="272" id="x.v-p9.2"><scripRef passage="Gen. xxviii. 2" id="x.v-p9.3" parsed="|Gen|28|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.28.2">Gen. xxviii.
2</scripRef>.</note>&#160; Doubtless the Patriarch learnt other secrets
he was unable to reveal, for unless he had received more interior light he
could never have discovered such sublime mysteries merely by watching angels
ascending and descending the steps. I am not certain whether this quotation is
correct; <pb n="191" id="x.v-Page_191"/>although
I have heard the passage, I cannot feel sure of recalling it exactly.</p>

<p id="x.v-p10">7.
Neither was Moses able to relate more than God willed of what he had seen in
the burning bush;<note n="273" id="x.v-p10.1"><scripRef passage="Exod. 2" id="x.v-p10.2" parsed="|Exod|2|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.2">Exod.
2</scripRef>.</note>&#160; but unless the Almighty had clearly revealed
certain mysteries to his soul, causing it to see and know its God was present,
the lawgiver could never have undertaken so many and such great labours. Such
sublime revelations were shown him amidst the thorns of the bush as to give him
the needful courage for his great deeds on behalf of the Children of Israel. We
must not, sisters, search out reasons for understanding the hidden things of
God, but, believing Him to be Almighty, we should be convinced that such worms
as ourselves, with our limited power of intelligence, are unable to comprehend
His wonders. Let us praise Him fervently for allowing us to understand
something of them.</p>

<p id="x.v-p11">8.
I wish I could find some simile for my subject: none seem to suit the purpose,
but I will make use of the following. Imagine that you are in an apartment&#8212;I
fancy it is termed <i>camarin</i> (or
private museum)&#8212;belonging to a king or a great nobleman, in which are placed
numberless kinds of articles of glass, porcelain, and other things, so arranged
that most of them are at once seen on entering the room.</p>

<p id="x.v-p12">9.
While on a visit to the house of the Duchess of Alva (where at her request I
was bidden by obedience to stay during a journey)<note n="274" id="x.v-p12.1">Do&#241;a Maria Enriquez, wife of
Ferdinand de Toledo, Duke of Alva. This visit took place in February, 1574, and
lasted two days the Saint being then on her journey from Salamanca to Alva de
Tormes. (<i>Found</i>. ch. xxi.)</note>&#160; I was taken <pb n="192" id="x.v-Page_192"/>into
such a room. I stood amazed on entering it and wondered what could be the use
of such a jumble of knick-knacks; then I thought that the sight of so many
different things should lead one to praise God. It is fortunate I saw them, for
they offer me a suitable comparison in this case. Although I was in the room
some time, there were so many objects in it that I forgot what I had seen and
could no more remember each object, nor of what it was made, than if I had
never seen it, though I recalled the sight of the whole collection.</p>

<p id="x.v-p13">10.
Something of this sort occurs when the spirit is very closely united to God. It
is introduced into this mansion of the empyrean heaven which must be in the
centre of our souls for since God resides in them, He must own one of the
mansions. While the soul is in ecstasy, our Lord does not appear to wish it to
apprehend these mysteries and its inebriation of joy in Him suffices it. But
sometimes He is pleased to withdraw it from this rapture when it at once
perceives what the mansion contains. On returning to itself, the mind can
recall what has been seen but is unable to describe it, nor can it, by its
natural abilities, attain to see more of the supernatural than God has chosen
to show it.</p>

<p id="x.v-p14">11.
Do I seem to own that the soul really sees something and that this is an
imaginary vision? I mean nothing of the sort: I am speaking of an intellectual
vision, but being so ignorant and dull I can explain nothing and am well aware
that if anything <pb n="193" id="x.v-Page_193"/>is
rightly stated, it does not come from myself.</p>

<p id="x.v-p15">12.
I think that if the soul learns no mysteries at any time during raptures, they
are no true raptures but some natural weakness that may occur to people of
delicate constitutions, such as women, when by its strenuous efforts the spirit
overpowers physical nature, and produces stupor, as I think I said in
connection with the prayer of quiet.<note n="275" id="x.v-p15.1"><i>Castle</i>,
M. iv. ch. iii. 2.</note>
</p>

<p id="x.v-p16">13.
This is not so in genuine raptures, for then I believe God ravishes the soul
wholly to Himself, as being His very own and His bride, and shows her some
small part of the kingdom she has thus won. However little this may be, all is
great that is in this great God. He will allow of no obstacle from the powers
or the senses but bids that the doors of all the mansions should be closed at once,
only leaving open the one He is in, so that we may enter it. Blessed be such
mercy&#8212;well may men be accursed who do not seek to profit by it, but who
forfeit it!</p>

<p id="x.v-p17">14.
O, my sisters! what nothingness is all we have given up, or that we do, or ever
could do for a God who thus wills to communicate Himself to a worm! If we hope
to enjoy this favour even during our mortal life, what are we doing? Why do we
delay? What can repay the loss of the time of a &#8216;Memento&#8217;<note n="276" id="x.v-p17.1">The Saint wrote here and
elsewhere <i>Memento</i>, and not <i>momenta</i> as is commonly printed. It
refers, of course, to that short interruption at Mass when the priest makes a
Memento of those for whom he intends to pray. Likewise St. Teresa often speaks
of the &#8216;space of a Credo or an Ave Maria&#8217; always implying a very short
duration.</note>&#160; in searching for this Lord, like the <pb n="194" id="x.v-Page_194"/>bride

though all the earthly pleasures, riches, and happiness that can be imagined
could last for eternity, they would be disappointing and base contrasted with
the treasures which are to be enjoyed for ever&#8212;and yet even <i>these</i> are nothing compared with the
possession for our own of the Lord of all treasures in heaven and earth.</p>

Oh, human blindness! When, oh, when shall this dust be taken from our eyes?
Although we think it insufficient to blind us, yet I see some little motes or
grains of dust which, if left to spread, will suffice to harm us greatly. At
least, for the love of God, my sisters, let these faults convince us of our
misery, serving to clear our sight as did the clay the eyes of the blind man
who was cured by the Spouse.<note n="278" id="x.v-p18.1">St.

I have unconsciously wandered far from my subject: forgive me, sisters. Believe
me, when I come to these wonders of God&#8217;s greatness (I mean when I come to
speak of them) I cannot but feel keenly grieved at seeing what we lose by our
own fault. It is true that His Majesty grants such favours to whom He chooses;
yet if we sought Him as He seeks us, He would give them to us all. He only
longs for souls on whom He may bestow them, for His gifts do not diminish His
riches.</p>

<p id="x.v-p20"> <pb n="195" id="x.v-Page_195"/>17.
To return to what I was describing. By the commands of the Bridegroom, the
doors of the mansions and even those of the keep and of the whole castle are
closed; for when He intends ravishing the soul He takes away the power of
speech, and although occasionally the other faculties are retained rather
longer, no word can be uttered.<note n="279" id="x.v-p20.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xx. 18. &#8216;Like a person who,
having a rope around his neck and being strangled, tries to breathe.&#8217;</note>&#160; Sometimes the person is at once deprived of
all the senses, the hands and body becoming as cold as if the soul had fled;
occasionally no breathing can be detected.<note n="280" id="x.v-p20.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. xx 23, 29. <i>Way of
Perf</i>. ch. xxxii. Rel. viii. 8, 11. &#8216;The first effect of ecstatic prayer
concerns the body, which remains as if the soul had departed; it grows cold
from a deficiency of natural heat, the eyes close gently, and the other senses
are suspended; and yet a weak body recovers health in this prayer.&#8217; (Anton. a
Spiritu Sancto, <i>Direct. Mystic</i>. tr.
iv. d. 2, &#167; 4, n. 150).</note>&#160; This condition lasts but a short while; I
mean in the same degree,<note n="281" id="x.v-p20.3">&#8217;Digo
para estar in un ser.&#8217;</note>&#160; for when this profound suspension diminishes
the body seems to come to itself and gain strength to return again to this <i>death</i> which gives more vigorous <i>life</i> to the soul.</p>

<p id="x.v-p21">18.
This supreme state of ecstasy never lasts long, but although it ceases, it
leaves the will so inebriated,<note n="282" id="x.v-p21.1">

and
the mind so transported out of itself that for a day, or sometimes for several
days, such a person is incapable of attending to anything but what excites the
will to the love of God; <pb n="196" id="x.v-Page_196"/>although
wide awake enough to this, she seems asleep as regards all earthly matters.</p>

<p id="x.v-p24">19.
Oh, when the soul wholly returns to itself, how abashed does it feel at having
received this favour and how passionate are its desires of serving God in any
way He asks of it! If the former states of prayer caused the powerful effects described,
what will not such a signal grace as this do? Such a person wishes she had a
thousand lives<note n="283" id="x.v-p24.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xx. 30.</note>&#160; to spend for God; she would have all earthly
creatures changed into as many tongues to praise Him on her account. She longs
to perform most severe penances,<note n="284" id="x.v-p24.2"><i>Castle</i>, M. vii. ch. iii. 4. <i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. xxxviii. 1. <i>Excl</i>. xiv. 3. <i>Life</i>, ch. xl. 27.</note>&#160; nor do they cost her much, for the power of
her love almost prevents their being felt. She realizes how little the martyrs
suffered during their tortures, for pain is easy when our Lord thus aids us:
therefore such a soul complains to His Majesty when He gives her no suffering?<note n="285" id="x.v-p24.3"><i>Life</i>, ch. xvi. 6. <i>Rel</i>. i. 4.</note>
</p>

<p id="x.v-p25">20.
She considers it a great favour when God sends her this rapture in secret, for
when others see it the shame and confusion she feels are so great as somewhat
to diminish her transport. Knowing the malice of the world, she fears her
ecstasy will not be attributed to its proper cause but may give rise to rash
judgment instead of the praise due for it to God. Although this pain and
distress are unavoidable, they seem to me to show a certain want of humility,
for if she wished to be despised, what would she care?<note n="286" id="x.v-p25.1"><i>Ibid</i>. ch. xx. 5, 6.</note>
</p>

<p id="x.v-p26"> <pb n="197" id="x.v-Page_197"/>21.
Our Lord once said to some one who was troubled by such thoughts: &#8216;Do not be
disturbed; people will either praise Me or condemn thee; in either case thou
wilt be the gainer.&#8217;<note n="287" id="x.v-p26.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxxi. 15. St. John of the
Cross in stanza xiii. 8. of the <i>Spiritual
Canticle</i>, refers to this and the following chapters. &#8216;This,&#8217; he says, &#8216;is
an appropriate opportunity for discussing the difference between raptures,
ecstasies, and other elevations and subtle flights of the spirit, to which
spiritual persons are liable; but as my object is to do nothing more than
explain this canticle, I leave the subject for those who are better qualified
than I am. I do this the more readily because our mother, the blessed Teresa of
Jesus, has written admirably on this matter, whose writings I hope to see soon
published,&#8217;</note>&#160; I learnt afterwards that she was greatly
encouraged and comforted by this speech; I speak of it in case others may
suffer in the same way. Apparently our Lord would have all men know that this
soul is His own and that none may molest it, for it is all His. Men are welcome
to attack, if they will, the body, the honour, and the possessions of such a
person, for glory will accrue to His Majesty from all they do; but the soul
they may not assail; unless by a most culpable presumption it withdraws from
the protection of its Spouse, He will defend it against the whole world and
against all hell besides.</p>

<p id="x.v-p27">22.
I do not know whether I have succeeded in teaching you what a rapture is; to
explain it fully would, as I said, be impossible. Still I do not think time has
been lost in describing a genuine rapture. The effects in false raptures are
very different. I do not call them &#8216;false&#8217; because people who experience them
intentionally deceive others, but because they are themselves unwittingly
deceived. As the signs and effects do not correspond with this great grace, <pb n="198" id="x.v-Page_198"/>the
favour itself becomes so discredited that naturally, when our Lord afterwards
bestows it on any soul, nobody believes in it. May He be for ever blessed and
praised! Amen, Amen!</p>

V.</h3>

<p class="Centered" id="x.vi-p1">TREATS
OF THE SAME SUBJECT AS THE LAST CHAPTER AND DESCRIBES THE FLIGHT OF THE SPIRIT,
WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY BY WHICH GOD ELEVATES THE SOUL: THIS REQUIRES GREAT
COURAGE IN ONE EXPERIENCING IT. THIS FAVOUR, BY WHICH GOD GREATLY DELIGHTS THE
SOUL IS EXPLAINED. THIS CHAPTER IS VERY PROFITABLE.</p>

<p class="Outline" id="x.vi-p2"><i>1. The flight of the spirit. 2. Self-control

<p id="x.vi-p3">1.
THERE is another form of rapture, which, though essentially the same as the
last, yet produces very different feelings in the soul. I call it the &#8216;flight
of the spirit,&#8217;<note n="288" id="x.vi-p3.1"><i>Rel</i>. viii. 10, 11. <i>Life</i>, ch. xviii, 8; xx. 3.</note>&#160; for
the soul suddenly feels so rapid a sense of motion that the spirit appears to
hurry it away with a speed which is very alarming, especially at first. Therefore
I said that the soul on whom God bestows this favour requires strong courage,
besides great faith, trust, and resignation, so that God may do what He chooses
with it.</p>

<p id="x.vi-p4">2.
Do you suppose a person in perfect possession of her senses feels but little
dismay at her soul&#8217;s being drawn above her, while sometimes, as we <pb n="199" id="x.vi-Page_199"/>read,
even the body rises with it?<note n="289" id="x.vi-p4.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xx. 9. St. John of the Cross, <i>Spiritual Canticle</i>, stanzas xiv.-xv. 23 <i>sqq</i>. Philippus a SS. Trinit. <i>l.c.</i> p. iii. tr. i. disc. iii. art. 3.
&#8217;This prayer of rapture is superior to the preceding grades of prayer, as also
to the ordinary prayer of union, and leaves much more excellent effects and
operations in many other ways.&#8217; St. Catherine of Siena (<i>Dialogue</i>, ch. lxxix. 1) says: &#8216;Wherefore, oftentimes, through the
perfect union which the soul has made with Me, she is raised from the earth
almost as if the heavy body became light. But this does not mean that the
heaviness of the body is taken away, but that the union of the soul with Me is
more perfect than the union of the body with the soul; wherefore the strength
of the spirit, united with Me, raises the body from the earth.&#8217; (Transl. by
Algar Thorold.)</note>&#160; She does not know where the spirit is going,
who is raising her, nor how it happens; for at the first instant of this sudden
movement one does not feel sure it is caused by God. Can it possibly be
resisted? No; resistance only accelerates the motion, as some one told me. God
now appears to be teaching the soul, which has so often placed itself
absolutely in His hands and offered itself entirely to Him, that it no longer
belongs to itself; thus it is snatched away more vehemently in consequence of
its opposition. Therefore this person resolved to resist no more than does a
straw when attracted by amber (a thing you may have seen); she yielded herself
into the hands of Him who is Almighty, seeing it is best to make a virtue of
necessity. Speaking of straw, doubtless it is as easy for a stalwart, strapping
fellow to lift a straw as for our mighty and powerful Giant to elevate our
spirit.<note n="290" id="x.vi-p4.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxii. 20.</note></p>

It seems that the cistern of water of which I spoke (but I cannot quite
remember where) in the fourth mansion,<note n="291" id="x.vi-p5.1"><i>Castle</i>,
M. iv. ch. ii. 3.</note>&#160; was formerly filled gently and <pb n="200" id="x.vi-Page_200"/>quietly,
without any movement; but now this great God Who restrains the springs and the
waters and will not permit the ocean to transgress its bounds,<note n="292" id="x.vi-p5.2"><scripRef passage="Prov. viii. 29" id="x.vi-p5.3" parsed="|Prov|8|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.8.29">Prov. viii. 29</scripRef>.</note>&#160; lets loose the streams, which with a powerful
rush flow into the cistern and a mighty wave rises, strong enough to uplift on
high the little vessel of our soul. Neither the ship herself nor her pilot and
sailors can at their choice control the fury of the sea and stop its carrying
the boat where it will: far less can the interior of the soul now stay where it
chooses or force its senses or faculties to act more than He Who holds them in
His dominion decrees; as for the exterior powers, they are here quite useless.</p>

<p id="x.vi-p6">4.
Indeed I am amazed, sisters, while merely writing of this manifestation of the
immense power of this great King and Monarch. Then what must be felt by those
who actually experience it? I am convinced that if His Majesty were to reveal
Himself thus to the greatest sinners on earth, they would never dare to offend
Him again&#8212;if not through love at least through fear of Him. What obligations
bind those taught in so sublime a manner to strive with all their might not to
displease such a Master! In His Name I beg of you, sisters, who have received
these or the like favours, not to rest content with merely receiving them but
to remember that she who owes much has much to pay.<note n="293" id="x.vi-p6.1">St. <scripRef passage="Luke xii. 48" id="x.vi-p6.2" parsed="|Luke|12|48|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.12.48">Luke xii. 48</scripRef>: &#8216;Cui

<p id="x.vi-p7">5.
This thought terrifies the soul exceedingly: <pb n="201" id="x.vi-Page_201"/>unless
the great courage needed was given it by our Lord, it would suffer great and
constant grief; for looking first at what His Majesty has done for it and then
upon itself, it sees how little good it has performed compared with what it was
bound to do, and that the paltry service it has rendered was full of faults,
failures and tepidity. To efface the remembrance of the many imperfections of
all its good deeds (if indeed it has ever performed any) it thinks best to
forget them altogether and to be ever mindful of its sins, casting itself on
the mercy of God since it cannot repay its debt to Him and begging for the pity
and compassion He ever shows to sinners.</p>

<p id="x.vi-p8">6.
Perhaps He will answer as He did to some one who was kneeling before a crucifix
in great affliction on this account, for she felt she had never had anything to
offer God nor to sacrifice for His sake. The Crucified One consoled her by
saying that He gave her for herself all the pains and labours He had borne in
His passion, that she might offer them as her own to His Father.<note n="294" id="x.vi-p8.1"><i>Rel</i>. ix. 8. This happened at Seville in
1575 or 1576.</note>&#160; I learnt from her that she at once felt
comforted and enriched by these words which she never forgets but recalls whenever
she realizes her own wretchedness and feels encouraged and consoled. I could
relate several other incidents of the same kind learnt in conversation with
many holy people much given to prayer, but I will not recount them lest you
might imagine they relate to myself.</p>

<p id="x.vi-p9">7.
I think this example is very instructive; it <pb n="202" id="x.vi-Page_202"/>shows
that we please our Lord by self-knowledge, by the constant recollection of our
poverty and miseries, and by realizing that we possess nothing but what we have
received from Him.<note n="295" id="x.vi-p9.1"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 7" id="x.vi-p9.2" parsed="|1Cor|4|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.7">1

order to receive this and many other favours which come to a soul elevated to
this state by our Lord; I think that if the soul is humble it requires more
valour than ever for this last mercy. May God grant us humility for His Name&#8217;s

To return to this sudden rapture of the spirit. The soul really appears to have
quitted the body, which however is not lifeless, and though, on the other hand,
the person is certainly not dead, yet she herself cannot, for a few seconds,
tell whether her spirit remains within her body or not.<note n="296" id="x.vi-p10.1"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 2" id="x.vi-p10.2" parsed="|2Cor|12|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.2">2 Cor. xii. 2</scripRef>: &#8216;Sive in

into another and a very different region from that in which we live, where a
light so unearthly is shown<note n="297" id="x.vi-p10.3">This
is called &#8216;lumen propheti&#230;&#8217; and is a transient form of the &#8216;lumen glori&#230;.&#8217; See
St. Thomas Aquinas, <i>Sum. theol</i>. 2a
2&#230;, q. 175, art. 3 ad 2.</note>&#160; that, if during her whole lifetime she had
been trying to picture it and the wonders seen, she could not possibly have
succeeded. In an instant her mind learns so many things at once that if the
imagination and intellect spent years in striving to enumerate them, it could
not recall a thousandth part of them.</p>

<p id="x.vi-p11">9.
This vision is not intellectual but imaginary and is seen by the eyes of the
soul more clearly <pb n="203" id="x.vi-Page_203"/>than
earthly things are seen by our bodily eyes. Although no words are pronounced,
the spirit is taught many truths; for instance, if it beholds any of the
saints, it knows them at once as well as if intimately acquainted with them for
years.<note n="298" id="x.vi-p11.1">The
same thing is related of some Saints while on earth, <i>e.g.</i> St Paul the first hermit and St. Anthony, who greeted each
other by name though neither knew nor had heard of the other.</note>&#160; Occasionally, besides what the eyes of the
soul perceive in intellectual vision, other things are shown it. In an
imaginary vision it usually sees our Lord accompanied by a host of angels; yet
neither the bodily eyes nor the eyes of the soul<note n="299" id="x.vi-p11.2">These words, though
necessary for the context, were only begun, but not completed by St. Teresa.</note>&#160; see anything, for these visions and many
other things impossible to describe, are revealed by some wonderful intuition
that I cannot explain. Perhaps those who have experienced this favour and
possess more ability than myself may be able to describe it, although it seems
to me a most difficult task.</p>

<p id="x.vi-p12">10.
I cannot tell whether the soul dwells in the body meanwhile or not: I would
neither affirm that it does nor that the body is deprived of it. I have often
thought that as, though the sun does not leave his place in the heavens yet his
rays have power to reach the earth instantaneously, so the soul and the spirit,
which make one and the same thing (like the sun and its rays) may, while
remaining in its own place, through the strength of the ardour coming to it
from the true Sun of Justice, send up some higher part of it above itself. In
fact I do not understand what I am talking about, but the truth is that, with
the swiftness of a bullet fired <pb n="204" id="x.vi-Page_204"/>from
a gun, an upward flight takes place in the interior of the soul. (I know no
other name for it but &#8216;flight.&#8217;) Although noiseless, it is too manifest a
movement to be any illusion<note n="300" id="x.vi-p12.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xx. 32. <i>Castle</i>, M. iv. ch. i. 10.</note>&#160; and
the soul is quite outside itself; at least that is the impression made upon it.
Great mysteries are revealed to it meanwhile, and when the person returns to
consciousness she is so greatly benefited that she holds all this world&#8217;s goods
as filth compared with what she has seen. Henceforth earthly life is grievous
to her and what used to please her now remains uncared for and
unnoticed.<note n="301" id="x.vi-p12.2"><p id="x.vi-p13">Compare &#167;&#167;
8-10 with Philippus a SS. Trinitate, <i>l.c.</i>
p. iii. tr. i. disc. iii. art. 3.</p>

<p id="x.vi-p14">&#8217;Muchas veces he pensado, si como el sol
est&#225;ndose en el cielo, que sus rayos tienen tanta fuerza, que no mud&#225;ndose &#233;l
de all&#237;, de presto llegan ac&#225;; si el alma y el esp&#237;ritu (que son una misma
cosa, como le es el soly sus rayos) puede, qued&#225;ndose ella en su puesto, con la
fuerza de calor que le viene del verdadero Sol de justicia, alguna parte
superior salir sobre s&#236; misma. En fin, yo no s&#233; lo que digo, lo que es verdad
es, que con la presteza que sale la pelota de un arcabuz, cuando le ponen el
fuego, se levanta en lo interior un vuelo (que yo no s&#233; otro nombre que le
poner) que aunque no hace ruido, hace movimento tan claro, que no puede ser
antojo en ninguna manera; y muy fuera de si misma, &#225; todo lo que puede
entender, se le muestran grandes cosas.&#8217;</p></note></p>

<p id="x.vi-p15">11.
Those children of Israel who were sent on first to the Land of Promise brought
back tokens from it;<note n="302" id="x.vi-p15.1"><scripRef passage="Num. xiii. 24" id="x.vi-p15.2" parsed="|Num|13|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Num.13.24">Num.
xiii. 24</scripRef>.</note>&#160; so here our Lord seems to seek to show the
soul something of the land to which it is travelling, to give it courage to
pass through the trials of its painful journey, now that it knows where it must
go to find rest. You may fancy that such profit could not thus quickly be
obtained, yet only those who have experienced what signal benefits <pb n="205" id="x.vi-Page_205"/>this
favour leaves in the soul can realize its value.</p>

<p id="x.vi-p16">12.
This clearly shows it to be no work of the devil; neither the imagination nor
the evil one could represent what leaves such peace, calm, and good fruits in
the soul, and particularly the following three graces of a very high order.<note n="303" id="x.vi-p16.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xx. 31. The same distinctions
with respect to divine and diabolical locutions may be found in <i>Life</i>, ch. xxv. 5.</note>&#160; The first of these is a perception of the
greatness of God which becomes clearer to us as we witness more of it.
Secondly, we gain self-knowledge and humility from seeing how creatures so base
as ourselves in comparison with the Creator of such wonders have dared to
offend Him in the past or venture to gaze on Him now.</p>

<p id="x.vi-p17">13.
The third grace is a contempt for all earthly things unless they are
consecrated to the service of so great a God. With such jewels the Bridegroom
begins to deck His Bride; they are too valuable for her to keep them
carelessly.<note n="304" id="x.vi-p17.1">&#8217;Dexteram
meam et collum meum cinxit lapidibus pretiosis; tradidit auribus meis
inestimabiles margaritas.&#8217; From the Office of St. Agnes.</note>&#160; These visions are so deeply engraved in her
memory that I believe she can never forget them until she enjoys them for
evermore, for to do so would be the greatest misfortune.<note n="305" id="x.vi-p17.2">This is undoubtedly the
correct rendering of this difficult and obscure passage.</note>&#160; But the Spouse Who gave her these gifts has
power to give her grace not to lose them.</p>

<p id="x.vi-p18">14.
I told you that courage was required by the soul, for do you think it is a
trifling matter for the spirit to feel literally separated from the body, as it
does when perceiving that it is losing its senses without understanding the
reason? There is need that <pb n="206" id="x.vi-Page_206"/>
He Who gives all the rest should include fortitude. You will say this fright is
well rewarded, and so say I. May He Who can bestow such graces be for ever
praised and may His Majesty vouchsafe that we may be worthy to serve Him. Amen.</p>

VI.</h3>

<p class="Centered" id="x.vii-p1">DESCRIBES
AN EFFECT WHICH PROVES THE PRAYER SPOKEN OF IN THE LAST CHAPTER TO BE GENUINE
AND NO DECEPTION, TREATS OF ANOTHER FAVOUR OUR LORD BESTOWS ON THE SOUL TO MAKE
IT PRAISE HIM FERVENTLY.</p>

<p class="Outline" id="x.vii-p2"><i>1. The soul longs for death. 2. The soul
cannot help desiring these favours. 3. St. Teresa bewails her inability to

<p id="x.vii-p3">1.
THESE sublime favours leave the soul so desirous of fully enjoying Him Who has
bestowed them that life becomes a painful though delicious torture, and death
is ardently longed for. Such a one often implores God with tears to take her
from this exile where everything she sees wearies her.<note n="306" id="x.vii-p3.1"><i>Excl</i>. ii. See poem 4, &#8216;Cuan triste es, Dios mio&#8217;; and the two
versions of &#8216;Vivir sin vivir en mi.&#8217; (Poems 3 and 4. <i>Minor Works</i>.)</note>&#160; Solitude alone brings great alleviation for a
time, but soon her grief returns and yet she cannot bear to be without it. In
short, this poor little butterfly can find no lasting rest. So tender is her
love that at the slightest provocation it flames forth and the soul takes
flight. Thus in this mansion raptures <pb n="207" id="x.vii-Page_207"/>occur
very frequently, nor can they be resisted even in public. Persecutions and
slanders ensue;<note n="307" id="x.vii-p3.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxv. 18.</note>&#160; however she may try, she cannot keep free
from the fears suggested to her by so many people, especially by her
confessors.</p>

<p id="x.vii-p4">2.
Although in one way she feels great confidence within her soul, especially when
alone with God, yet on the other hand, she is greatly troubled by misgivings
lest she is deceived by the devil and so should offend Him Whom she deeply
loves. She cares little for blame, except when her confessor finds fault with
her as if she could help what happens. She asks every one to pray for her<note n="308" id="x.vii-p4.1"><i>Ibid</i>. ch. xxv. 20. <i>Rel</i>. vii. 7.</note>&#160; since she has been told to do so, and begs
His Majesty to direct her by some other way than this which is so full of
danger. Nevertheless, so great are the benefits left by these favours that she
cannot but see that they lead her on the way to heaven,<note n="309" id="x.vii-p4.2"><i>Ibid</i>. ch. xxvii. 1, 2.</note>&#160; of which she has read and heard and learnt in
the law of God. As, strive how she may, she cannot resist desiring to receive
these graces, she resigns herself into God&#8217;s hands. Yet she is grieved at
finding herself forced to wish for these favours which appears to be
disobedience to her confessor, for she believes that in obedience, and in
avoiding any offence against God, lies her safeguard against deception. Thus
she feels she would prefer to be cut in pieces rather than wilfully commit a
venial sin, yet is greatly grieved at seeing that she cannot avoid unwittingly
falling into a great number. <pb n="208" id="x.vii-Page_208"/>
God bestows on such people so intense a desire neither ever to displease Him in
however small a matter, nor to commit any avoidable imperfection, that, were
there no other reason, they would try to avoid society and they greatly envy
those who live in deserts.<note n="310" id="x.vii-p4.3"><i>Rel</i>. i. 6.</note>&#160; On the other hand, they seek to live amidst
men in the hopes of helping if but one soul to praise God better.<note n="311" id="x.vii-p4.4"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxxii. 14; xxxv. 13. <i>Castle</i>, M. vii. ch. iv. 21 . <i>Found</i>. ch. i. 6, 7.</note>&#160; In the case of a woman, she grieves over the
impediment offered by her sex<note n="312" id="x.vii-p4.5"><i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. i.</note>&#160; and envies those who are free to proclaim
aloud to all Who is this mighty God of hosts.<note n="313" id="x.vii-p4.6">III Reg. xix. 10.</note></p>

<p id="x.vii-p5">3.
O poor little butterfly! chained by so many fetters that stop thee from flying
where thou wouldst! Have pity on her, O my God, and so dispose her ways that
she may be able to accomplish some of her desires for Thy honour and glory!
Take no account of the poverty of her merits, nor of the vileness of her
nature, Lord, Thou Who hast the power to compel the vast ocean to retire, and
didst force the wide river Jordan to draw back so that the Children of Israel
might pass through!<note n="314" id="x.vii-p5.1"><scripRef passage="Ps. cxiii. 3" id="x.vii-p5.2" parsed="|Ps|113|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.113.3">Ps.

she can endure many trials. She is resolved to do so&#8212;she desires to suffer
them. Stretch forth Thine arm, O Lord, to help her lest she waste her life on
trifles! Let Thy greatness appear in this Thy creature, womanish and weak as
she is, so that men, seeing the good in her is not her own, may praise Thee<pb n="209" id="x.vii-Page_209"/>for
it! Let it cost her what it may and as dear as she desires, for she longs to
lose a thousand lives to lead one soul to praise Thee but a little better. If
as many lives were hers to give, she would count them well spent in such a
cause, knowing as a truth most certain that she is unworthy to bear the
lightest cross, much less to die for Thee.</p>

<p id="x.vii-p6">4.
I cannot tell why I have said this, sisters, nor what made me do so; indeed I
never intended it. You must know that these effects are bound to follow from
such trances or ecstasies: they are not transient, but permanent desires; when
opportunity occurs of acting on them, they prove genuine. How can I say that
they are permanent, when at times the soul feels cowardly in the most trivial
matters and too timorous to undertake any work for God?</p>

<p id="x.vii-p7">5.
I believe it is because our Lord, for its greater good, then leaves the soul to
its natural weakness, which at once convinces it so thoroughly that any
strength it possessed came from His Majesty as to destroy its self-love,
enduing it with a greater knowledge of the mercy and greatness of God which He
deigned to show forth in one so vile. However, the soul is usually in the
former state. Beware of one thing, sisters; these ardent desires to behold our
Lord are sometimes so distressing as to need rather to be checked than to be
encouraged&#8212;that is, if feasible, for in another kind of prayer of which I
shall speak later, it is not possible as you will see.</p>

<p id="x.vii-p8">6.
In the state I speak of these longings can sometimes be arrested, for the
reason is at liberty <pb n="210" id="x.vii-Page_210"/>to
conform to the will of God and can quote the words of St. Martin;<note n="315" id="x.vii-p8.1">&#8217;When St.
Martin was dying, his brethren said to him: &#8216;Why, dear Father, will you leave
us? Or to whom can you commit us in our desolation? We know, indeed, that you
desire to be with Christ, but your reward above is safe and will not be diminished
by delay; rather have pity on us whom you are leaving desolate.&#8217; Then Martin,
always pitiful, moved by these lamentations, is said to have burst into tears.
Turning to God, he replied to the mourners around him only by crying: &#8216;O Lord,
if I am still necessary to Thy people, I do not shrink from toil; Thy will be
done.&#8217; (Sulpitius Severus, <i>Life of St.
Martin</i>, letter 3.)</note>&#160; should these desires become very oppressive,
the thoughts may be turned to some other matter. As such longings are generally
found in persons far advanced in perfection, the devil may excite them in order
to make us think we are of their number&#8212;in any case it is well to be cautious.
For my part, I do not believe he could cause the calm and peace given by this
pain to the soul, but would disturb it by such uneasiness as we feel when
afflicted concerning any worldly matter. A person inexperienced in both kinds
of sorrow cannot understand the difference, but thinking such grief an
excellent thing, will excite it as much as possible which greatly injures the
health, as these longings are incessant or at least very frequent.</p>

<p id="x.vii-p9">7.
You must also notice that bodily weakness may cause such pain, especially with
people of sensitive characters who cry over every trifling trouble.<note n="316" id="x.vii-p9.1"><i>Way of Perf.</i>. ch. xvii. 4; xix. 6.</note>&#160; Times without number do they imagine they are
mourning for God&#8217;s sake when they are doing no such thing. If for a
considerable space of time, whenever such a person hears the least mention of
God or thinks of Him at all, these fits of uncontrollable <pb n="211" id="x.vii-Page_211"/>weeping
occur,<note n="317" id="x.vii-p9.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxix. 12.</note>&#160; the cause may be an accumulation of humour
round the heart, which has a great deal more to do with such tears than has the
love of God. Such persons seem as if they would never stop crying: believing
that tears are beneficial, they do not try to check them nor to distract their
minds from the subject, but encourage them as much as possible. The devil
seizes this opportunity of weakening nuns so that they become unable to pray or
to keep their Rule.</p>

<p id="x.vii-p10">8.
I think you must be puzzling over this and would like to ask what I would have
you do, as I see danger in everything. If I am afraid of delusions in so good a
thing as tears, perhaps I myself am deluded, and may be I am! But believe me, I
do not say this without having witnessed it in other people although not in my
own case, for there is nothing tender about me and my heart is so hard as often
to grieve me.<note n="318" id="x.vii-p10.1">Compare
with this what we have said in note 1 to the second chapter of the Fourth
Mansions. <i>Rel</i>. ii. 12.</note>&#160; However, when the fire burns fiercely within,
stony as my heart may be, it distils like an alembic.<note n="319" id="x.vii-p10.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. xix. 1-3.</note>&#160; It is easy to know when tears come from this
source, for they are soothing and gentle rather than stormy and rarely do any
harm. This delusion, when it is one, has the advantage, with a humble person,
of only injuring the body and not the soul. But if one is not humble, it is
well to be ever on one&#8217;s guard.</p>

<p id="x.vii-p11">9.
Let us not fancy that if we cry a great deal we have done all that is
needed&#8212;rather we must <pb n="212" id="x.vii-Page_212"/>work
hard and practise the virtues: that is the essential&#8212;leaving tears to fall
when God sends them, without trying to force ourselves to shed them. Then, if
we do not take too much notice of them, they will leave the parched soil of our
souls well watered, making it fertile in good fruit; for this is the water
which falls from heaven.<note n="320" id="x.vii-p11.1"><i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. xix. 6. <i>Life</i>, ch. xviii. 12 <i>sqq</i>.</note>&#160; However we may tire ourselves in digging to
reach it, we shall never get any water like this; indeed, we may often work and
search until we are exhausted without finding as much as a pool, much less a
springing well!</p>

<p id="x.vii-p12">10.
Therefore, sisters, I think it best for us to place ourselves in the presence
of God, contemplate His mercy and grandeur and our own vileness and leave Him
to give us what He will, whether water or drought, for He knows best what is
good for us; thus we enjoy peace and the devil will have less chance to deceive
us.</p>

<p id="x.vii-p13">11.
Amongst these favours, at once painful and pleasant, Our Lord sometimes causes
in the soul a certain jubilation<note n="321" id="x.vii-p13.1">Philippus
a SS. Trinit. <i>l.c.</i> p. iii. tr. i.
disc. iv. art. 5. Antonius a Sp. S. <i>l.c.</i>
tr. iv. n.156.</note>&#160; and a strange and mysterious kind of prayer.
If He bestows this grace on you, praise Him fervently for it; I describe it so
that you may know that it is something real. I believe that the faculties of
the soul are closely united to God but that He leaves them at liberty to
rejoice in their happiness together with the senses, although they do not know
what they are enjoying nor how they do so. This may sound nonsense but it
really <pb n="213" id="x.vii-Page_213"/>happens.
So excessive is its jubilee that the soul will not enjoy it alone but speaks of
it to all around so that they may help it to praise God, which is its one
desire.<note n="322" id="x.vii-p13.2"><i>Rel</i>. ii. 12.</note></p>

<p id="x.vii-p14">12.
Oh, what rejoicings would this person utter and what demonstrations would she
make, if possible, so that all might know her happiness! She seems to have
found herself again and wishes, like the father of the prodigal son, to invite
all her friends to feast with her<note n="323" id="x.vii-p14.1">St.
<scripRef passage="Luke xv. 23" id="x.vii-p14.2" parsed="|Luke|15|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.15.23">Luke xv. 23</scripRef>.</note>&#160; and to see her soul in its rightful place,
because (at least for the time being) she cannot doubt its security. I believe
she is right, for the devil could not possibly infuse a joy and peace into the
very centre of her being which make her whole delight consist in urging others
to praise God. It requires a painful effort to keep silent and to dissemble
such impulsive happiness. St. Francis must have experienced this when, as the
robbers met him rushing through the fields crying aloud, he told them in answer
to their questions that he was the &#8216;herald of the great King.&#8217;<note n="324" id="x.vii-p14.3">&#8217;He plunged into a large
forest, and there in a loud voice and in French, he made the echoes resound
with the praises of God. Some robbers, attracted by his singing, rushed out
upon him. But the sight of so poor a man destroyed their hopes of booty. They
questioned him, and Francis gave them no answer beyond saying in allegorical
language: &#8216;I am the herald of the great King!&#8217; The robbers considered
themselves insulted by these words. They threw themselves upon him, beat him
severely, and went off after having thrown him into a ditch full of snow. This
treatment only added fire to the zeal of Francis. He sang his holy canticles
with greater love than before.&#8217; (Rev. Father L&#233;on, <i>Lives of the Saints of the Order of St. Francis</i>, vol. 1, ch, i,)</note>&#160; So felt other saints who retired into the
deserts so that, like St. Francis, they might proclaim the praises of their
God.</p>

<p id="x.vii-p15"> <pb n="214" id="x.vii-Page_214"/>13.
I knew Fray Peter of Alcantara who used to do this. I believe he was a saint on
account of the life he led, yet people often took him for a fool when they
heard him.<note n="325" id="x.vii-p15.1">&#8217;St.
Peter of Alcantara, in the jubilation of his soul through the impetuosity of
divine love, was occasionally unable to refrain from singing the divine praises
aloud in a wonderful manner. To do this more freely, he sometimes went into the
woods where the peasants who heard him sing took him for one who was beside
himself.&#8217; (Rev. Alban Butler, <i>Lives of
the Saints</i>.)</note>&#160; Oh happy folly, sisters! Would that God might
let us all share it! What mercy He has shown you in placing you where, if He
gave you this grace and it were perceived by others, it would rather turn to
your advantage than bring on you contempt as it would do in the world, where
men so rarely hear God praised that it is no wonder they take scandal at it.</p>

<p id="x.vii-p16">14.
Oh miserable times and wretched life spent in the world! How blest are those
whose happy lot it is to be freed from them!<note n="326" id="x.vii-p16.1"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. ii. 8; iii. i; viii. 1.</note>&#160; It often delights me, when in my sisters&#8217;
company to see how the joy of their hearts is so great that they vie with one
another in praising our Lord for placing them in this convent: it is evident
that their praises come from the very depths of their souls. I should like you
to do this often, sisters, for when one begins she incites the rest to imitate
her. How can your tongues be better employed when you are together than in
praising God, Who has given us so much cause for it?</p>

<p id="x.vii-p17">15.
May His Majesty often grant us this kind of prayer which is most safe and
beneficial; we cannot acquire it for ourselves as it is quite supernatural. <pb n="215" id="x.vii-Page_215"/> Sometimes it lasts for
a whole day and the soul is like one inebriated, although not deprived of the
senses;<note n="327" id="x.vii-p17.1">Compare
with this what has been said in the fourth chapter of this Mansion, &#167; 17, note
17.</note>&#160; nor like a person afflicted with melancholia,<note n="328" id="x.vii-p17.2">Melancholia
here as elsewhere means hysteria.</note>&#160; in which, though the reason is not entirely
lost, the imagination continually dwells on some subject which possesses it and
from which it cannot be freed. These are coarse comparisons to make in
connection with such a precious gift, yet nothing else occurs to my mind. In
this state of prayer a person is rendered by this jubilee so forgetful of self
and everything else that she can neither think nor speak of anything but
praising God, to which her joy prompts her. Let us all of us join her, my
daughters, for why should we wish to be wiser than she? What can make us
happier? And may all creatures unite their praises with ours for ever and ever.
Amen, amen, amen!</p>

<p id="x.viii-p3">1.
IT may seem to you, sisters, that souls to whom God has communicated Himself in
such a special manner may feel so sure of enjoying Him for ever as no longer to
require to fear or to mourn over their past sins. Those of you will be most apt
to hold this opinion who have never received the like favours; souls to whom
God has granted these <pb n="217" id="x.viii-Page_217"/>graces
will understand what I say. This is a great mistake, for sorrow for sin
increases in proportion to the divine grace received and I believe will never
quit us until we come to the land where nothing can grieve us any more.
Doubtless we feel this pain more at one time than at another and it is of a
different kind. A soul so advanced as that we speak of does not think of the
punishment threatening its offences but of its great ingratitude towards Him to
Whom it owes so much<note n="329" id="x.viii-p3.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. vi. 7.</note>&#160; and Who so justly deserves that it should
serve Him, for the sublime mysteries revealed have taught it much about the
greatness of God.</p>

<p id="x.viii-p4">2.
This soul wonders at its former temerity and weeps over its irreverence; its
foolishness in the past seems a madness which it never ceases to lament as it
remembers for what vile things it forsook so great a Sovereign. The thoughts
dwell on this more than on the favours received, which, like those I am about
to describe, are so powerful that they seem to rush through the soul at times
like a strong, swift river. Yet the sins remain like the mire in the river bed
and dwell constantly in the memory, making a heavy cross to bear.</p>

<p id="x.viii-p5">3.
I know some one who, though she had ceased to wish for death in order to see
God,<note n="330" id="x.viii-p5.1"><i>Excl</i>. vi. 4, 5. <i>Supra</i>, M. v. ch. ii, 5. <i>Poems</i>
2, 3, 4. <i>Minor Works</i>.</note>&#160; yet desired it that she might be freed from
her continual regret for her past ingratitude towards Him to Whom she owed, and
always would owe, so much. She thought no one&#8217;s guilt could be compared to her
own, for she felt there could be none with whom <pb n="218" id="x.viii-Page_218"/> God had borne so patiently nor on
whom He had bestowed such graces.</p>

<p id="x.viii-p6">4.
Souls that have reached the state I speak of have ceased to fear hell. At
times, though very rarely, they grieve keenly over the possibility of their
losing God; their sole dread is lest He should withdraw His hand, allowing them
to offend Him, and so they might return to their former miserable condition.
They care nothing for their own pain or glory; if they are anxious not to stay
long in Purgatory, it is more on account of its keeping them from the Presence
of God than because of its torments. Whatever favours God may have shown a
soul, I think it is dangerous for it to forget the unhappy state it was once
in; painful as the remembrance may be, it is most beneficial.</p>

<p id="x.viii-p7">5.
Perhaps I think so because I have been so wicked and that may be the reason why
I never forget my sins; people who have led good lives have no cause for grief;
yet we always fall at times whilst living in this mortal body. This pain is not
lessened by reflecting that our Lord has already forgiven and forgotten our
faults; our grief is rather increased at seeing such kindness and favours
bestowed on one who deserves nothing but hell. I think St. Paul and the
Magdalen must thus have suffered a cruel martyrdom;<note n="331" id="x.viii-p7.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxi, 9. All editions have &#8216;Peter&#8217;. St. Teresa only wrote
&#8217;P<sup>o</sup>&#8217; but the parallel passage proves she meant Pablo, and not Pedro.
See also M. i. ch. i. 5.</note>&#160; their love was intense, they had received
many mercies and realized the greatness and the majesty of God and so must have
found it very hard to bear the remembrance <pb n="219" id="x.viii-Page_219"/>of
their sins, which they must have regretted with a most tender sorrow.</p>

<p id="x.viii-p8">6.
You may fancy that one who has enjoyed such high favours need not meditate on
the mysteries of the most sacred Humanity of our Lord Jesus Christ but will be
wholly absorbed in love. I have written fully about this elsewhere.<note n="332" id="x.viii-p8.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxii. 9-11.</note>&#160; I have been contradicted and told that I was
wrong and did not understand the matter; that our Lord guides souls in such a
way that after having made progress it is best to exercise oneself in matters
concerning the Godhead and to avoid what is corporeal; yet nothing will make me
admit that this latter is a good way.</p>

<p id="x.viii-p9">7.
I may be mistaken; we may all really mean the same thing but I found the devil
was trying to lead me astray in this manner. Having been warned by experience
in this respell, I have decided to speak again about it here although I have
very often done so elsewhere.<note n="333" id="x.viii-p9.1"><i>Ibid</i>. ch. xxii. i; xxiii. 18; xxiv. 2.</note>&#160; Be most cautious on the subject; attend to
what I venture to say about it and do not believe any one who tells you the
contrary. I will endeavour to explain myself more clearly than I did before. If
the person who undertook to write on the matter had treated it more explicitly
he would have done well, for it may do much harm to speak of it in general
terms to us women, who have scanty wits.</p>

<p id="x.viii-p10">8.
Some souls imagine they cannot meditate even on the Passion, still less on the
most blessed Virgin or on the saints, the memory of whose lives greatly <pb n="220" id="x.viii-Page_220"/>benefits
and strengthens us.<note n="334" id="x.viii-p10.1">&#8217;Deliberate
forgetfulness and rejection of all knowledge and of form must never be extended
to Christ and His sacred Humanity. Sometimes, indeed, in the height of
contemplation and pure intuition of the Divinity the soul does not remember the
Sacred Humanity, because God raises the mind to this, as it were, confused and
most supernatural knowledge; but for all this, studiously to forget it is by no
means right, for the contemplation of the sacred Humanity and loving meditation
upon it will help us up to all good, and it is by it we shall ascend most
easily to the highest state of union. It is evident at once that, while all
visible and bodily things ought to be forgotten, for they are a hindrance in
our way, He, Who for our salvation became man, is not to be accounted among
them, for He is the truth, the door, and the way, and our guide to all good.&#8217;
(St. John of the Cross <i>Ascent of Mount
Carmel</i>, bk. iii. ch. i. 12-14.</note>&#160; I cannot think what such persons are to
meditate upon, for to withdraw the thoughts from all corporeal things like the
angelic spirits who are always inflamed with love, is not possible for us while
in this mortal flesh; we need to study, to meditate upon and to imitate those
who, mortals like ourselves, performed such heroic deeds for God. How much less
should we wilfully endeavour to abstain from thinking of our only good and
remedy, the most sacred Humanity of our Lord Jesus Christ? I cannot believe
that any one really does this; they misunderstand their own minds and so harm
both themselves and others. Of this at least I can assure them: they will never
thus enter the last two mansions of the castle. If they lose their Guide, our
good Jesus, they cannot find the way and it will be much if they have stayed
safely in the former mansions. Our Lord Himself tells us that He is &#8216;the Way&#8217;;
He also says that He is &#8216;the Light&#8217;; that no man cometh to the Father but by
Him; and that &#8216;He that seeth Me, seeth the Father also.&#8217;<note n="335" id="x.viii-p10.2">St. <scripRef passage="John viii. 12" id="x.viii-p10.3" parsed="|John|8|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.8.12">John viii. 12</scripRef>; xiv. 6,
9.</note></p>

<p id="x.viii-p11"> <pb n="221" id="x.viii-Page_221"/>9.
Such persons tell us that these words have some other meaning; I know of no
other meaning but this, which my soul has ever recognized as the true one and
which has always suited me right well. Some people (many of whom have spoken to
me on the subject) after our Lord has once raised them to perfect
contemplation, wish to enjoy it continually. This is impossible; still, the
grace of this state remains in their souls in such a way that they cannot
reason as before on the mysteries of the Passion and the Life of Christ. I
cannot account for it but it is very usual for the mind thus to remain less apt
for meditation. I think it must be because, as the one end of meditation is to
seek God, after He has once been found and the soul is accustomed to seek Him
again by means of the will, it no longer wearies itself by searching for Him
with the intellect.</p>

<p id="x.viii-p12">10.
It also appears to me that as the will is already inflamed with love, this
generous faculty would, if it could, cease to make use of the reason. This
would be well, were it not impossible, especially before the soul has reached
the last two mansions.<note n="336" id="x.viii-p12.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xv. 20. St. John of the Cross
treats the subject most carefully. He shows how and when meditation becomes
impossible: <i>Ascent of Mount Carmel</i>,
bk. ii. ch. xii. (<i>circa finem</i>) ch.
xiii. (<i>per totum</i>). <i>Living Flame of Love</i>, stanza iii. 35. <i>Obscure Night</i>, bk. i. ch. x. 8, and bk.
ii. ch. viii. That it should be procured whenever possible: <i>Ibid</i>. bk. i. ch. x. (<i>in fine</i>); that it should be resumed; <i>Ascent of Mount Carmel</i>; bk. ii, ch. xv.</note>&#160; Time spent in prayer would thus be lost as
the will often needs the use of the understanding to rekindle its love. Notice
this point, sisters, which as it is important I will explain more fully. Such a
soul <pb n="222" id="x.viii-Page_222"/>desires
to spend all its time in loving God and wishes to do nothing else; but it
cannot succeed, for though the will is not dead yet the flame which kindled it
is dying out and the spark needs fanning into a glow. Ought the soul to remain
quiescent in this aridity, waiting like our father Elias for fire to descend
from heaven<note n="337" id="x.viii-p12.2">III
Reg. xviii. 30-39.</note>&#160; to consume the sacrifice which it makes of
itself to God? Certainly not; it is not right to expect miracles; God will work
them for this soul when He chooses. As I have told you already and shall do
again, His Majesty wishes us to hold ourselves unworthy of their being wrought
on our account and desires us to help ourselves to the best of our abilities.</p>

<p id="x.viii-p13">11.
In my opinion we ought during our whole life, to act in this manner, however
sublime our prayer may be. True, those whom our Lord admits into the seventh
mansion rarely or never need thus to help their fervour, for the reason I will
tell you of; if I recollect it when I come to write of this room where, in a
wonderful manner, souls are constantly in the company of Christ our Lord both
in His Humanity and His Divinity.<note n="338" id="x.viii-p13.1">Continual
sense of the presence of God: <i>Life</i>,
ch. xxvii. 6. <i>Rel</i>. xi. 3: &#8216;The
intellectual vision of the Three Persons and of the Sacred Humanity seems ever
present.&#8217; <i>Castle</i>, M. vii. ch. iv. 15.</note>&#160; Thus, when the fire in our hearts, of which I
spoke does not burn in the will, nor do we feel the presence of God, we must
search for Him as He would have us do, like the Bride in the Canticles,<note n="339" id="x.viii-p13.2">Cant, iii.
3; &#8216;Num quem diligit anima mea, vidistis?&#8217;</note>&#160; and must ask all creatures &#8216;who it was that
made them;&#8217; as St. Augustine (either in his <i>Soliloquies</i>
or his <pb n="223" id="x.viii-Page_223"/> <i>Confessions</i>) tells us that he
did.<note n="340" id="x.viii-p13.3"><p id="x.viii-p14">&#8217;I asked the
earth, and it answered me: &#8216;I am not He&#8217;; and whatsoever it contains confessed
the same. I asked the sea and the depths, and the living, creeping things, and
they answered: &#8216;We are not thy God, seek above us.&#8217; I asked the heavens, I
asked the moving air; and the whole air with its inhabitants answered:
&#8217;Anaximenes was deceived, I am not God.&#8217; I asked the heavens, sun, moon, stars.
&#8217;Nor,&#8217; say they, &#8216;are we the God Whom thou seekest.&#8217; And I replied unto all
things which encompass the door of my flesh: &#8216;Ye have told me of my God, that
ye are not He; tell me something of Him.&#8217; And they cried out with a loud voice:
&#8217;He made us.&#8217; By my thought of them I questioned them, and their beauty gave
their answer.&#8217; (<i>St. Augustine&#8217;s
Confessions</i>, bk. x. ch. 6.)</p>

<p id="x.viii-p15">St.
Teresa may have read this in St. Augustine&#8217;s <i>Confessions</i>, (see above, p. 78), or in the <i>Soliloquies</i>, a collection of extracts from St. Augustine, St.
Bernard, St. Anselm, etc., which was printed in Latin at Venice in 1512,
translated into Spanish and brought out at Valladolid in 1515, and again at
Medina del Campo in 15 53, and at Toledo in 1565. The words quoted by St.
Teresa occur in chapter xxxi. See <i>Life</i>,
ch. xl. 10.</p></note>&#160; Thus we shall not stand like blockheads,
wasting our time in waiting for what we before enjoyed. At first, it may be
that our Lord will not renew His gift again for a year or even for many years;
His Majesty knows the reason which we should not try to discover since there is
no need for us to understand it.</p>

<p id="x.viii-p16">12.
As most certainly the way to please God is to keep the commandments and
counsels, let us do so diligently, while meditating on His life and death and
all we owe Him; then let the rest be as God chooses. Some may answer that their
mind refuses to dwell on these subjects; and for the above causes, this to a
certain extent is true. You know that it is one thing to reason and another
thing for the memory to bring certain truths before the mind. Perhaps you may
not understand me; possibly I fail to express myself rightly but I will do my <pb n="224" id="x.viii-Page_224"/>best.
Using the understanding much in this manner is what I call meditation.</p>

<p id="x.viii-p17">13.
Let us begin by considering the mercy God showed us by giving us His only Son;
let us not stop here but go on to reflect upon all the mysteries of His
glorious life; or let us first turn our thoughts to His prayer in the garden,
then allow them to continue the subject until they reach the crucifixion. Or we
may take some part of the Passion such as Christ&#8217;s apprehension and dwell on
this mystery, considering in detail the points to be pondered and thought over,
such as the treachery of Judas, the flight of the Apostles, and all that
followed. This is an admirable and very meritorious kind of prayer.<note n="341" id="x.viii-p17.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xiii. 17-23.</note></p>

<p id="x.viii-p18">14.
Souls led by God in supernatural ways and raised to perfect contemplation are
right in declaring they cannot practise this kind of meditation. As I said, I
know not why, but as a rule they are unable to do so. Yet they would be wrong
in saying that they cannot dwell on these mysteries nor frequently think about
them, especially when these events are being celebrated by the Catholic Church.
Nor is it possible for the soul which has received so much from God to forget
these precious proofs of His love which are living sparks to inflame the heart with
greater love for our Lord, nor can the mind fail to understand them. Such a
soul comprehends these mysteries, which are brought before the mind and stamped
on the memory in a more perfect way than with other people, so that the mere
sight of our Lord prostrate <pb n="225" id="x.viii-Page_225"/>in
the garden, covered with His terrible sweat, suffices to engross the thoughts
not merely for an hour but for several days. The soul looks with a simple gaze
upon Who He is and how ungratefully we treat Him in return for such terrible
sufferings. Then the will, although perhaps without sensible tenderness,
desires to render Him some service for such sublime mercies and longs to suffer
something for Him Who bore so much for us, employing itself in similar
considerations in which the memory and understanding also take their part.</p>

<p id="x.viii-p19">15.
I think this is why such souls cannot reason connectedly about the Passion and
fancy they are unable to mediate on it. Those who do not meditate on this
subject had better begin to do so; for I know that it will not impede the most
sublime prayer nor is it well to omit praising this often. If God then sees fit
to enrapture them, well and good; even if they are reluctant, He will make them
cease to meditate. I am certain that this way of king is most helpful to the soul
and not the hindrance it would become were great efforts made to use the
intellect. This, as I said, I believe cannot be done when a higher state of
prayer is attained. It may be otherwise in some cases, for God leads souls in
many different ways. Let not those be blamed, however, who are unable to
discourse much in prayer, nor should they be judged incapable of enjoying the
great graces contained in the mysteries of Jesus Christ, our only Good, which
no one, however spiritual he may be, can persuade me it is well to omit
contemplating. <pb n="226" id="x.viii-Page_226"/>16.
There are souls who, having made a beginning, or advanced half-way, when they
begin to experience the prayer of quiet and to taste the sweetness and
consolations God gives, think it is a great thing to enjoy these spiritual
pleasures continually. Let them, as I advised elsewhere, cease to give
themselves up so much to this absorption. Life is long and full of crosses and
we have need to look on Christ our pattern, to see how He bore His trials, and
even to take example by His Apostles and saints if we would bear our own trials
perfectly. Our good Jesus and His most blessed Mother are too good company to
be left and He is well pleased if we grieve at His pains, even though sometimes
at the cost of our own consolations and joys.<note n="342" id="x.viii-p19.1"><i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. xxv. 7.</note>&#160;
Besides, daughters, consolations are not so frequent in prayer that we
have no time for this as well. If any one should tell me she continually enjoys
them, and that she is one of those who can never meditate on the divine
mysteries, I should feel very doubtful about her state. Be convinced of this;
keep free from this deception and to the utmost of your power stop yourselves
from being constantly immersed in this intoxication. If you cannot do so, tell
the Prioress so that she may employ you too busily for you to think of the
matter; thus you will be free from this danger which, if it does no more, when
it lasts long, greatly injures the health and brain. I have said enough to
prove to those who require it that, however spiritual their state, it is an
error so to avoid thinking of corporeal things <pb n="227" id="x.viii-Page_227"/>as
to imagine that meditation on the most sacred Humanity can injure the soul.</p>

<p id="x.viii-p20">17.
People allege, in defence, that our Lord told His disciples that it was expedient
for them that He should go from them.<note n="343" id="x.viii-p20.1">St. <scripRef passage="John xvi. 7" id="x.viii-p20.2" parsed="|John|16|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.16.7">John xvi. 7</scripRef>: &#8216;Expedit vobis ut ego vadam;
si enim non abiero, Paraclitus non veniet ad vos.&#8217; <i>Life</i>, ch. xxii. 1, 2 and note.</note>&#160; This I cannot admit. He did not say so to His
blessed Mother, for her faith was firm. She knew He was both God and man; and
although she loved Him more dearly than did His disciples, it was in so perfect
a way that His bodily presence was a help to her. The faith of the Apostles
must have been weaker than it was later on, and than ours has reason to be. I
assure you, daughters, that I consider this a most dangerous idea whereby the
devil might end by robbing us of our devotion to the most blessed Sacrament.</p>

<p id="x.viii-p21">18.
The mistake I formerly made<note n="344" id="x.viii-p21.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxii. 11. Although the Saint
defends herself against the charge of self-contradiction, there can be no doubt
from this avowal that she too was at one time mistaken on this point.</note>&#160; did not lead me as far as this, but I did not
care so much about meditating on our Lord Jesus Christ, preferring to remain
absorbed, awaiting spiritual consolations. I recognized clearly that I was
going wrong, for as I could not always keep in this state, my thoughts wandered
hither and thither and my soul seemed like a bird, ever flying about and
finding no place for rest. Thus I lost much time and did not advance in virtue
nor make progress in prayer.</p>

<p id="x.viii-p22">19.
I did not understand the reason, and as I believed that I was acting wisely I
think I should never have learnt it but for the advice of a servant <pb n="228" id="x.viii-Page_228"/>of
God whom I consulted about my mode of prayer. Then I perceived plainly how
mistaken I had been and I have never ceased regretting that there was a time
when I did not realize how difficult it would be to gain by so great a loss.
Even if I could, I would seek for nothing save by Him through Whom comes all
the good we possess. May He be for ever praised! Amen.</p>

12. Cautions about this vision</i>.</p>

<p id="x.ix-p3">1.
To prove to you more clearly, sisters, the truth of what I have been saying and
to show that the more the soul advances, the closer does this good Jesus bear
it company, it would be well for me to tell you how, when He so chooses, it
cannot withdraw from His presence. This is clearly shown by the manners and
ways in which His Majesty communicates Himself to us, manifesting His love by
wonderful apparitions and visions which, if He is pleased to aid me, I will
describe to you so that you may not be alarmed if any of these favours are
granted you. We ought, even if we do not receive <pb n="229" id="x.ix-Page_229"/>them
ourselves, to praise Him fervently for thus communing with creatures, seeing
how sovereign are His majesty and power.</p>

<p id="x.ix-p4">2.
For example, a person who is in no way expecting such a favour nor has ever
imagined herself worthy of receiving it, is conscious that Jesus Christ stands
by her side although she sees Him neither with the eyes of the body nor of the
soul.<note n="345" id="x.ix-p4.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxvii. 3, 5. <i>Rel</i>. vii. 26.</note>&#160; This is called an intellectual vision; I
cannot tell why. I knew a person to whom God granted both this grace and others
I shall describe later on. At first it distressed her, for she could not understand
it; she could see nothing, yet so convinced did she feel that Jesus Christ was
thus in some way manifesting Himself that she could not doubt that it was some
kind of vision, whether it came from God or no. Its powerful effects were a
strong argument that it was from Him; still she was alarmed, never having heard
of an intellectual vision, nor was she aware that such a thing could be. She
however felt certain of our Lord&#8217;s presence,<note n="346" id="x.ix-p4.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxvii. 7.</note>&#160; and He spoke to her several times in the way
that I described. Before she had received this favour, she had heard words
spoken but had never known who uttered them.</p>

<p id="x.ix-p5">3.
She was frightened by this vision which, unlike an imaginary one, does not pass
away quickly but lasts for several days and even sometimes for more than a
year. She went, in a state of great anxiety, to her confessor<note n="347" id="x.ix-p5.1"><i>Ibid</i>. <i>l.c.</i> 4. Father Juan
de Pradanos was then the Saint&#8217;s confessor.</note>&#160; who asked her how, if she saw <pb n="230" id="x.ix-Page_230"/>nothing,
she knew that our Lord was near her, and bade her describe His appearance. She
said that she was unable to do so, nor could she see His face nor tell more
than she had already done, but that she was sure it was the fact that it was He
Who spoke to her and it was no trick of her imagination. Although people
constantly cautioned her against this vision, as a rule she found it impossible
to disbelieve in it, especially when she heard the words: &#8216;It is I, be not
afraid&#8217;<note n="348" id="x.ix-p5.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxv. 22; XXX. 17. <i>Supra</i>, M. vi. ch. iii. 5. <i>Rel</i>. vii. 22. St. John of the Cross, <i>Ascent of Mount Carmel</i>, bk. ii. ch.
xxxi. 1.</note>
</p>

<p id="x.ix-p6">4.
The effect of this speech was so powerful that for the time being she could not
doubt its truth. She felt much encouraged and rejoiced at being in such good
company, seeing that this favour greatly helped her to a constant recollection
of God and an extreme care not to displease in any way Him Who seemed ever by
her side, watching her. Whenever she desired to speak to His Majesty in prayer,
or even at other times, He seemed so close that He could not fail to hear her
though He did not speak to her whenever she wished, but unexpectedly, when
necessity arose. She was conscious of His being at her right hand, although not
in the way we know an ordinary person to be beside us but in a more subtle
manner which cannot be described. Yet this presence is quite as evident and
certain, and indeed far more so, than the ordinary presence of other people
about which we may be deceived; not so in this, for it brings with it graces
and spiritual effects which could not come from melancholia. Nor could the
devil thus fill the soul with peace, <pb n="231" id="x.ix-Page_231"/>with
a constant desire to please God, and such utter contempt of all that does not
lead to Him. As time went on, my friend recognized that this was no work of the
evil one, as our Lord showed her more and more clearly.</p>

<p id="x.ix-p7">5.
However, I know that she often felt great alarm and was at times overcome with
confusion, being unable to account for so high a favour having been granted
her. She and I were so very intimate<note n="349" id="x.ix-p7.1">In fact, one and the same person.</note>&#160; that I knew all that passed in her soul,
hence my account is thoroughly true and reliable. This favour brings with it an
overwhelming sense of self-abasement and humility; the reverse would be the
case, did it come from Satan.<note n="350" id="x.ix-p7.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. xix. a; xx. 38. <i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xxxvi. 10.</note>&#160; It is evidently divine; no human effort could
produce such feelings nor could any one suppose that such profit came from
herself, but must needs recognize it as a gift from the hand of God.</p>

<p id="x.ix-p8">6.
Although I believe some of the former favours are more sublime, yet this brings
with it a special knowledge of God; a most tender love for Him results from
being constantly in His company, while the desires of devoting one&#8217;s whole
being to His service are more fervent than any hitherto described. The
conscience is greatly purified by the knowledge of His perpetual and near
presence, for although we know that God sees all we do, yet nature inclines us
to grow careless and forgetful of it. This is impossible here since our Lord
makes the soul conscious that He is close at hand, thus preparing it to receive
the other graces mentioned <pb n="232" id="x.ix-Page_232"/>by
constantly making acts of love to Him Whom it sees or feels at its side. In
short, the benefits caused by this grace prove how great and how valuable it
is. The soul thanks our Lord for bestowing it on one unworthy of it, but who
would refuse to exchange it for any earthly riches or delight.</p>

<p id="x.ix-p9">7.
When our Lord chooses to withdraw His presence, the soul in its loneliness
makes every possible effort to induce Him to return. This avails but little,
for this grace comes at His will and not by our endeavours. At times we may
enjoy the company of some saint,<note n="351" id="x.ix-p9.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxix 6.</note>&#160; which also brings us great profit. You will
ask me, if we see no one, how can we know whether it is Christ, or His most
glorious Mother, or a saint? Such a person cannot answer this question or know
how she distinguishes them, but the fact remains undoubted. It seems easy to
recognize our Lord when He speaks, but it is surprising how the soul can,
without hearing a word from him, recognize which saint has been sent by God to
be its companion and helper.</p>

<p id="x.ix-p10">8.
There are other spiritual matters which cannot be explained. Our inability to
grasp them should teach us how incapable is our nature of understanding the
sublime mysteries of God. Those on whom these favours are bestowed should
marvel at and praise God&#8217;s mercy for them. As these particular graces are not
granted to everybody, any one who receives them should esteem them highly and
strive to serve God more zealously, since He has given her such special aid.
Therefore such a person does <pb n="233" id="x.ix-Page_233"/>not
rate herself more highly on this account, but rather thinks she serves Him less
than any one else in the world; feeling herself to be under greater obligations
to Him than others, any fault she commits pierces her to the heart, as indeed
it ought under the circumstances.</p>

<p id="x.ix-p11">9.
When the effects described are felt, any of you whom our Lord leads by this way
may be certain that it is neither deception nor fancy in her case. I believe it
to be impossible for the devil to produce an illusion lasting so long, neither
could he benefit the soul so remarkably nor cause such interior peace. It is not
his custom, nor, if he would, could such an evil creature bring about so much
good; the soul would soon be clouded by self-esteem and the idea that it was
better than others. The mind&#8217;s continual keeping in the presence of God<note n="352" id="x.ix-p11.1">Gen. xvii,
1: &#8216;Ambula coram me et esto perfectus.&#8217;</note>&#160; and
the concentration of its thoughts on Him would so enrage the fiend that,
although he might try the experiment once, he would not often repeat it. God is
too faithful to permit him so much power over one whose sole endeavour is to
please His Majesty and to lay down her life for His honour and glory; He would
soon unmask the demon&#8217;s artifices.</p>

<p id="x.ix-p12">10.
I contend, as I always shall, that if the soul reaps the effects described from
these divine graces, although God may withdraw these special favours, His
Majesty will turn all things to its advantage; even should He permit the devil
to deceive it at any time, the evil spirit will only reap his own confusion.
Therefore, as I told you, daughters, <pb n="234" id="x.ix-Page_234"/>none
of you who are led by this way need feel alarm. Fear is good and we should be
cautious and not overconfident, for if such favours made you careless, it would
prove they were not from God as they did not leave the results I described. It
would be well at first to tell your case, under the seal of confession, to a
thoroughly qualified theologian (for that is the source whence we must obtain
light) or to some highly spiritual person. If your confessor is not very
spiritual, a good theologian would be preferable;<note n="353" id="x.ix-p12.1">&#8217;Magni doctores scholastici,
si non sint spirituales, vel omni rerum spiritualium experientia careant, non
solent esse magistri spirituales idonei&#8212;nam theologia scholastica est
perfectio intellectus; mystica, perfectio intellectus et voluntatis: unde bonus
theologus scholasticus potest esse malus theologus mysticus. In rebus tamen
difficilibus, dubiis, spiritualibus, pr&#230;stat mediocriter spiritualem theologum
consulere quam spiritualem idiotam.&#8217; (Schram, Theol. Myst. &#167; 483.)</note>&#160; best of all, one who unites both qualities.<note n="354" id="x.ix-p12.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. v. 6.</note>&#160; Do not be disturbed if he calls it mere
fancy; if it is, it can neither harm nor benefit your soul much. Recommend
yourself to the divine Majesty and beg Him not to allow you to be misled.</p>

<p id="x.ix-p13">11.
It would be worse should he tell you the devil is deceiving you, although no
learned man would say so if he sees in you the effects described. Even should
your adviser say this, I know that the same Lord Who is beside you will comfort
and reassure you and will go to your counsellor and give him light that he may
impart it to you.<note n="355" id="x.ix-p13.1"><i>Ibid</i>. ch. xxv. 18 <i>sqq</i>. <i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. iv.
11; v. 3.</note>&#160; If the director, though given to prayer, has
not been led by God in this way, he will at once take fright and condemn it.
Therefore I advise you to choose <pb n="235" id="x.ix-Page_235"/>a
qualified theologian and, if possible, one who is also spiritual. The Prioress
ought to allow you this, for although she may feel sure that you are safe from
delusion because you lead a good life, yet she is bound to permit you to consult
some one for your mutual security. When you have conferred with these persons,
be at peace; trouble yourself no more about the matter, for sometimes when
there is no cause for fear, the demon gives rise to such immoderate scruples
that the person cannot be satisfied with consulting her confessor only once on
the subject, especially if he is inexperienced and timid or if he bids her
consult him again.</p>

<p id="x.ix-p14">12.
Thus that which should have been kept strictly private becomes public;<note n="356" id="x.ix-p14.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxiii. 14-15. <i>Rel</i>. vii. 17.</note>&#160; such a person is persecuted and tormented and
finds that what she believed to be her own secret has become public property.
Hence she suffers many troubles which may even devolve upon the Order in such
times as these. Consequently I warn all Prioresses that great caution is
required in such matters; also they must not think a nun more virtuous than the
rest because such favours are shown her. Our Lord guides every one, in the way
He knows to be best. This grace, if made good use of, prepares one receiving it
to become a great servant of God, but sometimes our Lord bestows it on the
weakest souls; therefore in itself it is neither to be esteemed nor condemned.
We must look to the virtues; she who is most mortified, humble and single-minded
in serving God is the most holy. However, we can never feel very certain about
such matters until the true <pb n="236" id="x.ix-Page_236"/>
Judge rewards each one according to his merits. Then we shall be surprised to
find how very different is His judgment from that of this world. May He be for
ever praised. Amen.</p>

CHAPTER SPEAKS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH GOD COMMUNICATES WITH THE SOUL BY
IMAGINARY VISIONS. STRONG REASONS ARE GIVEN FOR NOT DESIRING TO BE LED IN THIS
WAY; THIS IS VERY PROFITABLE READING.</p>

<p id="x.x-p3">1.
Now we come to treat of imaginary visions, whereby it is held that the devil is
more liable to deceive people than by the other visions I have already
described. This is probably true. Yet when imaginary visions are divine, they
seem, in a certain manner, more profitable for us than the others, as being
more suited to our nature&#8212;with the exception of the visions sent by our Lord
in the seventh mansion which far surpass all others. The presence of our Lord
described in the last chapter may thus be symbolized. Let us suppose that we
have in our possession a gold locket containing a precious stone of the highest
value and powers, which, though we have not seen it, we are certain <pb n="237" id="x.x-Page_237"/>is
in the case, and its virtues benefit us when we wear the pendant. Although we
have never gazed on it we value it highly, knowing by experience that it has
cured us of maladies for which it is remedial. However, we dare not look at it
nor open the locket nor could we do so even if we wished, for the owner of the
jewel alone knows the secret of unfastening its casket. Although he lent it us
for our use, yet he kept the key for himself; he will open the trinket when he
chooses to show us its contents and close it again when he sees fit to do so.</p>

<p id="x.x-p4">2.
Our Lord treats us here in this way. Now, suppose the owner of this locket
suddenly opened it at times for the benefit of the person to whom he has
entrusted it; doubtless the latter would value the diamond more highly through
remembering its wonderful lustre. This may be compared to what happens when our
Lord is pleased to caress the soul. He shows it in vision His most sacred Humanity
under whatever form He chooses; either as He was during His life on earth<note n="357" id="x.x-p4.1"><i>Life</i>, ch, vii, 11.</note>&#160; or after His resurrection.<note n="358" id="x.x-p4.2"><i>Ibid</i>. xxix, 4.</note>&#160; The vision passes as quickly as a flash of
lightning, yet this most glorious picture makes an impression on the
imagination that I believe can never be effaced until the soul at last sees
Christ to enjoy Him for ever. Although I call it a &#8216;picture,&#8217; you must not
imagine that it looks like a painting; Christ appears as a living Person Who sometimes
speaks and reveals deep mysteries. You must understand that though the soul
sees this for a certain space of time, it is no more possible to continue <pb n="238" id="x.x-Page_238"/>looking
at it than to gaze for a very long time on the sun; therefore this vision
passes very quickly, although its brightness does not pain the interior sight
in the same way as the sun&#8217;s glare injures our bodily eyes.</p>

<p id="x.x-p5">3.
The image is seen by the interior sight alone; but of bodily apparitions I can
say nothing, for the person I know so intimately never having experienced
anything of the kind herself could not speak about them with certainty.<note n="359" id="x.x-p5.1"><i>Life</i>, ch, vii. 11, 12.</note>&#160; The splendour of Him Who is revealed in the
vision resembles an infused light like that of the sun covered with a veil as transparent
as a diamond, if such a texture could be woven, while His raiment looks like
fine linen. The soul to whom God grants this vision almost always falls into an
ecstasy, nature being too weak to bear so dread a sight. I say &#8216;dread,&#8217; though
this apparition is more lovely and delightful than anything that could be
imagined even though any one should live a thousand years and spend all that
time in trying to picture it, for it far surpasses our limited imagination and
understanding; yet the presence of such surpassing majesty inspires the soul
with great fear.</p>

<p id="x.x-p6">4.
There is no need to ask how the soul knew Who He was or who declared with
absolute certainty that He was the Lord of heaven and earth. This is not so
with earthly kings; unless we were told their names or saw their attendant
courtiers, they would attract little notice. O Lord, how little do we
Christians know Thee! What will that day be in which Thou comest as our Judge,
since now, <pb n="239" id="x.x-Page_239"/>when
Thou comest as a Friend to Thy spouse, the sight of Thee strikes us with such
awe? O daughters! what will it be when He says in wrath: &#8216;Go, accursed of my
Father?&#8217;<note n="360" id="x.x-p6.1">St.
<scripRef passage="Matt. xxv. 41" id="x.x-p6.2" parsed="|Matt|25|41|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.41">Matt. xxv. 41</scripRef>: &#8216;Discedite a me, maledicti, in ignem &#230;ternum.&#8217;</note> Let this impression be the
result of this favour granted by God to the soul and we shall reap no little
benefit from it, since St. Jerome, saint as he was, ever kept the thought of
the last judgment before his eyes.<note n="361" id="x.x-p6.3">&#8217;Whenever
I ponder on the Day of Judgment I am overwhelmed by the thought and tremble
from head to foot.&#8217; (St. Jerome). The following saying is by some attributed to
St. Jerome, though not to be found in his works: &#8216;Whether I eat or drink, or
whatever else I do, the dreadful trumpet of the last day seems always sounding
in my ears: Arise, ye dead, and come to judgment.&#8217; (Alban Butler, <i>Life of St. Jerome</i>). The <i>Life of Christ</i> by Ludolf of Saxony gives
this quotation with the word <i>vox</i>
instead of <i>tuba</i> (part ii. ch.
lxxxvii. 9).</note>&#160; Thus we shall care nothing what sufferings we
endure from the austerities of our Rule, for long as they may last, the time is
but a moment compared to this eternity of pain. I sincerely assure you that,
wicked as I am, I have never feared the torments of hell<note n="362" id="x.x-p6.4"><i>Life</i>, ch. iii.</note>&#160; for they have seemed to me as nothing when I remembered
that the lost would see the beautiful, meek and pitiful eyes of our Lord turned
on them in wrath.<note n="363" id="x.x-p6.5"><i>Excl</i>. xiii, 3.</note>&#160; I have thought all my life that this would be
more than my heart could bear.</p>

<p id="x.x-p7">5.
How much more must any one fear this to whom our Lord so revealed Himself in
vision here as to overcome her feelings and produce unconsciousness! This must
be the reason that the soul remains in a rapture: our Lord strengthens its
weakness so as to unite it to His greatness in this sublime communion with God.
When any one <pb n="240" id="x.x-Page_240"/>can
contemplate this sight of our Lord for a long time, I do not believe it is a
vision but rather some overmastering idea which causes the imagination to fancy
it sees something; but this illusion is only like a dead image in comparison
with the living reality of the other case.</p>

<p id="x.x-p8">6.
As not only three or four, but a large number of people have spoken to me on
the subject, I know by experience that there are souls which, either because
they possess vivid imaginations or active minds, or for some other reason of
which I am ignorant, are so absorbed in their own ideas as to feel certain they
see whatever their fancy imagines. If they had ever beheld a genuine vision,
they would recognize the deception unmistakably. They themselves fabricate,
piece by piece, what they fancy they see: no after effects are produced on the
mind, which is less moved to devotion than by the sight of a sacred picture. It
is clear that no attention should be paid to such fancies, which pass more
quickly than dreams from the memory.</p>

<p id="x.x-p9">7.
In the favour of which I speak, the case is very different. A person is far
from thinking of seeing anything, no idea of which has crossed the mind, when
suddenly the vision is revealed in its entirety, causing within the powers and
senses of the soul a fright and confusion soon changed into a blissful peace.
Thus, after St. Paul was thrown to the ground, a great tempest and noise
followed from heaven;<note n="364" id="x.x-p9.1"><scripRef passage="Acts ix. 3, 4" id="x.x-p9.2" parsed="|Acts|9|3|9|4" osisRef="Bible:Acts.9.3-Acts.9.4">Acts
ix. 3, 4</scripRef>.</note>&#160; so, in the interior world of the soul, there
is a violent tumult followed instantly, as I said, by <pb n="241" id="x.x-Page_241"/>perfect
calm. Meanwhile certain sublime truths have been so impressed on the mind that
it needs no other master, for with no effort of its own, Wisdom Himself has
enlightened its former ignorance.</p>

<p id="x.x-p10">8.
The soul for some time afterwards possesses such certainty that this grace
comes from God that whatever people may say to the contrary it cannot fear
delusion. Later on, when her confessor suggests doubts to her, God may allow
such a person to waver in her belief for a time and to feel misgivings lest, in
punishment for her sins, she may possibly have been left to go astray. However,
she does not give way to these apprehensions, but (as I said in speaking of
other matters)<note n="365" id="x.x-p10.1"><i>Castle</i>, M. vi. ch. iii. 12.</note>&#160; they only affect her in the same way as the
temptations of the devil against faith, which may disturb the mind but do not
shake the firmness of belief. In fact, the more severe the assault,<note n="366" id="x.x-p10.2"><i>Way of Perf</i> ch, xl. 4.</note>&#160; the more certain is she that the evil one
could never have produced the great benefits she is conscious of having
received, because he exercises no such power over the interior of the soul. He
may present a false apparition but it does not possess such truth, majesty, and
efficacy.</p>

<p id="x.x-p11">9.
As confessors cannot see these effects, which perhaps the person to whom God
has shown the vision is unable to explain, they are afraid of deception, as
indeed they have good reason to be. Therefore caution is necessary and time
should be allowed to see what effects follow. Day by day, the progress of the
soul in humility and in the virtues should be watched: if the devil is
concerned in the matter, he will soon show signs of himself and will <pb n="242" id="x.x-Page_242"/>be
detected in a thousand lies. If the confessor is experienced and has received
such favours himself, he will not take long in discovering the truth. In fact,
he will know immediately, on being told of the vision, whether it is divine or
comes from the imagination or the demon: more especially if he has received the
gift of discerning spirits&#8212;then, if he is learned, he will understand the
matter at once even though he has not personally experienced the like.</p>

<p id="x.x-p12">10.
The great point is, sisters, that you should be perfectly candid and
straightforward with your confessor: I do not mean in declaring your sins that
is evident enough&#8212;but in giving him an account of your prayer.<note n="367" id="x.x-p12.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxvi. 5; xxviii. 21.</note>&#160; Unless you do this, I cannot assure you of
your safety nor that you are led by God. Our Lord desires that we should be as
truthful and open with those who stand in His place as we should with Himself;
that we should wish them to know not only our thoughts but especially all
relating to our actions, however insignificant. Then you need feel no trouble
nor anxiety<note n="368" id="x.x-p12.2"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xl. 3.</note>&#160; because even if your vision were not from
God, it could do you no harm if you are humble and possess a good conscience,
for His Majesty knows how to glean good from evil. What the devil intended to
injure you will benefit you instead: believing that God has granted you such
signal favours, you will strive to please Him better and will keep His image
ever before your memory.</p>

<p id="x.x-p13"> <pb n="243" id="x.x-Page_243"/>11.
A great theologian<note n="369" id="x.x-p13.1">This
was Father Dominic Ba&#241;ez. <i>Found</i>. ch.
viii. 3. <i>Life</i>, ch. xxix. 6, 7 and
note.</note>&#160; once said that he should not trouble himself
though the devil, who is a clever painter, should present before his eyes the
living image of Christ, which would only kindle his devotion and defeat the
evil one with his own weapons. However wicked an artist may be, we should
reverence his picture if it represents Him Who is our only good. This great
scholar held that it was very wrong to advise any one who saw a vision of our
Lord to offer it signs of scorn,<note n="370" id="x.x-p13.2"><i>Letters of Blessed John of Avila</i>
(translated by the Benedictines of Stanbrook), i. 5, p. 19.</note>&#160; because we are bound to show respect to the
portrait of our King wherever we see it. I am sure that he was right, for even
in the world any one who was on friendly terms with a person would take it as
an offence were his portrait treated with contempt. How much more should we
always show respect to a crucifix or a picture of our heavenly Sovereign
wherever it meets our gaze! Although I have written about this elsewhere, I am
glad of the opportunity of saying it now for I know some one who was deeply
pained at being bidden to behave in this way. I know not who can have invented
such a torture for one who felt bound to obey the counsel given by her
confessor, for she would have thought her soul was at stake had she disobeyed
him. My advice is, if you are given such an order, that humbly alleging the
reasons I have set before you to your confessor, you should not carry it out. I
am perfectly satisfied with the motives given for doing so by him who
counselled me on this subject.</p>

<p id="x.x-p14"> <pb n="244" id="x.x-Page_244"/>12.
One great advantage gained by the soul from this favour shown by our Lord is
that when thinking of Him or of His life and Passion, the remembrance of His
most meek and beautiful face brings with it the greatest consolation. In the
same way, we feel happier after having seen a benefactor than if we had never
known him personally. I can assure you that the remembrance of the joy caused
by this vision gives us the greatest comfort and assistance.</p>

<p id="x.x-p15">13.
Many other advantages result; but as I have written elsewhere<note n="371" id="x.x-p15.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxviii. 13, 4.</note>&#160; at
length about the effect these visions produce, and must do so again later on, I
will say no more now lest I weary us both. But I most earnestly advise you,
when you know or hear of God&#8217;s bestowing these graces on others, never to pray
nor desire to be led by this way yourself though it may appear to you to be
very good; indeed, it ought to be highly esteemed and reverenced, yet no one
should seek to go by it for several reasons. Firstly, as it is a want of
humility to desire what you have never deserved, I do not think any one who
longs for these graces can be really humble: a common labourer never dreams of
wishing to be made a king&#8212;the thing seems impossible and he is unfit for it; a
lowly mind has the same feeling about these divine favours. I do not believe
God will ever bestow these gifts on such a person, as before doing so He always
gives thorough self-knowledge. How can that soul, while filled with such lofty
aspirations, realize the truth that He has shown it great mercy in not casting
it into hell?</p>

<p id="x.x-p16">14.
The second reason is that such a one is certain <pb n="245" id="x.x-Page_245"/>to
be deceived or at least is in great danger of delusion, for an entrance is thus
left open to the devil, who only needs to see the door left ajar to slip in at
once and play us a thousand tricks.</p>

<p id="x.x-p17">15.
Thirdly: when people strongly desire a thing, the imagination makes them fancy
they see or hear it, just as when a man&#8217;s mind is set upon a subject all day he
dreams of it at night.</p>

<p id="x.x-p18">16.
Fourthly: it would be very presumptuous of me to choose a way for myself
without knowing what is good for me.<note n="372" id="x.x-p18.1">St. Teresa, when led in this way, always
asked to be delivered from favours so dangerous as visions, etc. See <i>Life</i>, ch. xxv. 20; xxvii. 3.</note>&#160; I should leave our Lord, Who knows my soul,
to guide me as is best for me so that His will may be done in all things.</p>

<p id="x.x-p19">17.
Fifthly: do you think people on whom our Lord bestows these favours have little
to suffer? No, indeed! their trials are most severe and of many kinds. How can
you tell whether you would be able to bear them?</p>

<p id="x.x-p20">18.
Sixthly: perhaps what you think would be your gain might prove your loss, as
happened to Saul when he was made king.<note n="373" id="x.x-p20.1">I. Reg. xv. 26-28.</note>&#160; In short, sisters, there are other reasons
besides these; believe me, it is safer to wish only what God wishes, Who knows
us better than we know ourselves and Who loves us. Let us place ourselves
entirely in His hands so that His will may be done in us; we can never go
astray if our will is ever firmly fixed on this.</p>

<p id="x.x-p21">19.
Know that for having received many favours of this kind, you will not merit
more glory but will <pb n="246" id="x.x-Page_246"/>be
the more stringently obliged to serve, since you have received more. God does
not deprive us of anything by which we merit more, for this remains in our own
control. There are many saints who never knew what it was to receive one such
favour, while others who have received them are not saints at all. Do not imagine
that these gifts are continually bestowed; indeed, for one that is granted, the
soul bears many a cross, so that instead of longing to receive more favours, it
only strives to use them better.</p>

<p id="x.x-p22">20.
True, such a grace is a most powerful aid towards practising the virtues in
their highest perfection, but it is far more meritorious to gain them at the
cost of one&#8217;s own toil. I was acquainted with some one,<note n="374" id="x.x-p22.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xl. 27. She herself was one, and the other, no doubt, was
St. John of the Cross.</note>&#160; indeed with two people (of whom one was a
man), on whom our Lord had bestowed some of these gifts. They were both so
desirous of serving His Majesty at their own cost without these great
consolations and so longed to suffer for His sake, that they remonstrated with
Him for giving them these favours, and if it had been possible would have
refused to receive them. When I say &#8216;consolations,&#8217; I do not mean these visions
which greatly benefit the soul and are highly to be esteemed, but the delights
given by God during contemplation.</p>

<p id="x.x-p23">21.
I believe that these desires are supernatural and proper to very fervent souls
who wish to prove to God that they do not serve Him for pay; so as I said, such
people do not urge themselves to work <pb n="247" id="x.x-Page_247"/>harder
for Him by the thought of the glory they will gain, but rather labour to
satisfy their love, of which the nature is to toil for the Beloved in a
thousand ways. Such souls would fain find a way to consume themselves in Him,
and were there need that, for the sake of God&#8217;s greater glory, they should be
annihilated for ever, they would count it great gain. May He be for ever
praised Who, in abasing Himself to hold converse with us miserable creatures,
vouchsafes to manifest His greatness! Amen.</p>

X.</h3>

<p class="Centered" id="x.xi-p1">SPEAKS
OF VARIOUS OTHER GRACES GOD BESTOWS ON THE SOUL IN DIFFERENT WAYS, AND OF THE
GREAT BENEFITS CONFERRED BY THEM.</p>

<p class="Outline" id="x.xi-p2"><i>1. Reasons for speaking of these
supernatural favours. 2. An intellectual vision. 3. God compared to a palace in
which His creatures dwell. 4. Forgive as we are forgiven. 5. The vision shows
God to be Truth itself. 6. We should imitate God by truthfulness. 7. Why God
reveals these truths</i>.</p>

<p id="x.xi-p3">1.
OUR Lord communicates with the soul by means of these apparitions on many
occasions&#8212;sometimes when it is afflicted, at other times when it is about to
receive some heavy cross, and again for the sake of the mutual delight of
Himself and His beloved. There is no need for me to specify each different case
nor do I intend to do so. I only wish to teach you (as far as I am acquainted
with them myself) what are the different favours God shows a soul in this state
so that you may understand their characteristics and the effects they produce. <pb n="248" id="x.xi-Page_248"/> Thus you will not
mistake every idle fancy for a vision and if you really see one, knowing that
such a thing is possible, you will not be disturbed nor unhappy. The devil, who
gains greatly by it, is delighted to see a soul troubled and distressed,
knowing how this hinders it from employing itself wholly in loving and serving
God.</p>

<p id="x.xi-p4">2.
His Majesty has far higher ways of communicating Himself to the soul; they are
less dangerous for I do not think the evil spirit can imitate them. They are
more difficult to explain, being more abstruse; therefore imaginary visions are
easier to describe. God is sometimes pleased, while a person is engaged in
prayer and in perfect possession of her senses, to suspend them and to discover
sublime mysteries to her which she appears to see within God Himself. This is
no vision of the most sacred Humanity nor can I rightly say the soul &#8216;sees,&#8217;
for it sees nothing; this is no imaginary vision but a highly intellectual one,
wherein is manifested how all things are beheld in God and how He contains them
within Himself.<note n="375" id="x.xi-p4.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xl. 13-16.</note>&#160; It is of great value, for although passing in
an instant, it remains deeply engraved in the memory, producing a feeling of
great shame in the mind which perceives more clearly the malice of offences
against God, since these most heinous sins are committed within His very being
since we dwell within Him. I will try to explain this truth to you by a
comparison, for although it is obvious and has been often told us, we either
never reflect upon it or do not wish to <pb n="249" id="x.xi-Page_249"/>understand
it. If we realized it, we could not possibly behave with such audacity.</p>

<p id="x.xi-p5">3.
Let us compare God to a very spacious and magnificent mansion or palace and
remember that this edifice is God Himself. Can the sinner withdraw from it in
order to carry out his crimes? No, certainly not, for within this very palace,
that is, within God Himself, are perpetrated all the abominations, impurities
and evil deeds that sinners commit. Oh awful thought, well worthy to be
pondered over! What profit it would bring to us, who know so little and
understand these truths but partially or how could we possibly be so reckless
in our daring? Let us, sisters, meditate on the infinite mercy and patience of
God in not casting us down to hell at once and let us render Him hearty thanks.
Surely we should be ashamed of resenting anything done or said against us&#8212;<i>we</i> who are the scum of the earth&#8212;when
we see what outrages are offered to <i>God</i>
our <i>Creator</i> within His very being, by
us His creatures; yet we are wounded whenever we hear of an unkind word having
been spoken of us in our absence, although perhaps with no evil intention.</p>

<p id="x.xi-p6">4.
Oh misery of mankind! When, daughters, shall we imitate Almighty God in any
way? Oh, let us not think we are doing great things if we suffer injuries <i>patiently</i>: rather let us bear them with <i>alacrity</i>; let us love our enemies, since
this great God has not ceased to love us in spite of our many sins! This is
indeed the chief reason that all should forgive any harm done them. I assure
you, daughters, that though this vision passes very quickly, <pb n="250" id="x.xi-Page_250"/>our
Lord has bestowed signal grace on her to whom He grants it, if she seeks to
profit by keeping it constantly in mind.</p>

<p id="x.xi-p7">5.
Short as the time lasts, yet, in a manner impossible to describe, God also
manifests that in Him there is a verity which makes all truth in creatures seem
obscure. He convinces the soul that He alone is that Truth which cannot lie,
thus demonstrating the meaning of David&#8217;s words in the psalm: &#8216;Every man is a
liar,&#8217;<note n="376" id="x.xi-p7.1"><scripRef passage="Ps. cxv. 11" id="x.xi-p7.2" parsed="|Ps|115|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.115.11">Ps.
cxv. 11</scripRef>. &#8216;Omnis homo mendax.&#8217;</note>&#160; which could never be thus realized by any
other means, however often we might hear that God is truth infallible. As I
recall Pilate and how he besought our Lord in His Passion to answer his
question: &#8216;What is truth?&#8217;<note n="377" id="x.xi-p7.3">St.
<scripRef passage="John xviii. 38" id="x.xi-p7.4" parsed="|John|18|38|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.18.38">John xviii. 38</scripRef>: Quid est veritas?</note>&#160; I realize how little mortals know of that
sublime veracity.</p>

<p id="x.xi-p8">6.
I wish I could explain this better but am unable to do so. Let us learn from
it, sisters, that if we would bear any resemblance to our God and our Spouse,
we must strive to walk ever in the truth. I do not merely mean that we should
not tell falsehoods thank God, I see that in these convents you are most
careful never to do so on any account&#8212;but I desire that as far as possible we
should at with perfect truth before God and man and above all that we should
not wish to be thought better than we are; that in all our deeds we should
ascribe to God what is His and attribute what is ours to ourselves, and that we
should seek for verity in all things. Thus we shall care little for this world,
which is but deception and falsehood, and therefore <pb n="251" id="x.xi-Page_251"/>cannot
last. Once, while I was wondering why our Lord so dearly loves the virtue of
humility, the thought suddenly struck me, without previous reflection, that it
is because God is the supreme Truth and humility is the <i>truth</i>, for it is most true that we have nothing good of ourselves
but only misery and nothingness: whoever ignores this, lives a life of
falsehood. They that realize this fact most deeply are the most pleasing to
God, the supreme Truth, for they walk in the truth. God grant, sisters, that we
may have the grace never to lose this self-knowledge! Amen.</p>

<p id="x.xi-p9">7.
Our Lord shows the soul these favours because she is now indeed His bride,
resolute to do His will in all things; therefore He wishes to give her some
idea how to accomplish it and to manifest to her some of His divine attributes.
I need say no more about it, but I believe the two points above mentioned will
prove very useful. These favours should cause no fear but lead us to praise God
for bestowing these graces. I think neither the devil nor our own imaginations
can have much to do with them, therefore the soul may rest in perfect peace.</p>

<p id="x.xii-p3">1.
WILL all these graces bestowed by the Spouse upon the soul suffice to content
this little dove or butterfly (you see I have not forgotten her after all!) so
that she may settle down and rest in the place where she is to die? No indeed:
her state is far worse than ever; although she has been receiving these favours
for many years past, she still sighs and weeps because each grace augments her
pain. She sees herself still far away from God, yet with her increased
knowledge of His attributes her longing and her love for Him grow ever stronger
as she learns more fully how this great God and Sovereign deserves to be loved.
As, year by year her yearning after Him gradually becomes keener, she
experiences the bitter suffering I am about to describe. I speak of &#8216;years&#8217;
because relating what happened to the person I mentioned, though I know well
that with God time has no limits and in a single moment He can raise a soul to
the most sublime state I have described. His Majesty has the power to do all He
wishes and He wishes to do much for us. These longings, tears, sighs, and <pb n="253" id="x.xii-Page_253"/>violent
and impetuous desires and strong feelings, which seem to proceed from our
vehement love, are yet as nothing compared with what I am about to describe and
seem but a smouldering fire, the heat of which, though painful, is yet
tolerable.</p>

<p id="x.xii-p4">2.
While the soul is thus inflamed with love, it often happens that, from a
passing thought or spoken word of how death delays its coming, the heart
receives, it knows not how or whence, a blow as from a fiery dart.<note n="378" id="x.xii-p4.1"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxix. 17. (Transverberation.)</note>&#160; I do not say that this actually is a &#8216;dart,&#8217;
but, whatever it may be, decidedly it does not come from any part of our being.<note n="379" id="x.xii-p4.2"><i>Ibid</i>. ch. xxix. 13, 14. <i>Rel</i>. viii. 16-19.</note>&#160; Neither is it really a &#8216;blow&#8217; though I call
it one, but it wounds us severely&#8212;not, I think, in that part of our nature
subject to physical pain but in the very depths and centre of the soul, where
this, thunderbolt, in its rapid course, reduces all the earthly part of our
nature to powder. At the time we cannot even remember our own existence, for in
an instant, the faculties of the soul are so fettered as to be incapable of any
action except the power they retain of increasing our torture. Do not think I
am exaggerating; indeed I fall short of explaining what happens which cannot be
described.</p>

<p id="x.xii-p5">3.
This is a trance of the senses and faculties except as regards what helps to
make the agony more intense. The understanding realizes acutely what cause
there is for grief in separation from God and His Majesty now augments this
sorrow by a vivid manifestation of Himself. This increases the anguish to such
a degree that the sufferer gives vent

<pb n="254" id="x.xii-Page_254"/>to
loud cries which she cannot stifle, however patient and accustomed to pain she
may be, because this torture is not corporal but attacks the innermost recesses
of the soul. The person I speak of learnt from this how much more acutely the
spirit is capable of suffering than the body; she understood that this
resembled the pains of purgatory, where the absence of the flesh does not
prevent the torture&#8217;s being far worse than any we can feel in this world.</p>

<p id="x.xii-p6">4.
I saw some one in this condition who I really thought would have died, nor
would it have been surprising, for there is great danger of death in this
state. Short as is the time it lasts, it leaves the limbs all disjointed and
the pulse as feeble as if the soul were on the point of departure, which is
indeed the case, for the natural heat fails, while that which is supernatural so
burns the frame that were it increased ever so little God would satisfy the
soul&#8217;s desire for death. Not that any pain is felt by the body at the moment,
although, as I said, all the joints are dislocated so that for two or three
days afterwards the suffering is too severe for the person to have even the
strength to hold a pen;<note n="380" id="x.xii-p6.1">St.
John of the Cross, <i>Obscure Night</i>, bk.
ii. ch. i. (<i>in fine</i>); <i>Spiritual Canticle</i>, stanza xiii; xiv-xv.
(<i>in fine</i>). When this happened to St.
Teresa she was unable to write for twelve days. Ribera, <i>Acta SS</i>. p. 555 (<i>in fine</i>).
<i>Rel</i>. viii. 13. <i>Life</i>, ch. xx. 16.</note>&#160; indeed I believe that the health becomes
permanently enfeebled in consequence. At the time this is not felt, probably
because the spiritual torments are so much more keen that the bodily ones
remain unnoticed; just as when there is very <pb n="255" id="x.xii-Page_255"/>severe
pain in one part, slighter aches elsewhere are hardly perceived, as I know by
experience. During this favour there is no physical suffering either great or
small, nor do I think the person would feel it were she torn to pieces.</p>

<p id="x.xii-p7">5.
Perhaps you will say this is an imperfection, and you may ask why she does not
conform herself to the will of God since she has so completely surrendered
herself to it. Hitherto she has been able to do so and she consecrated her life
to it; but now she cannot because her reason is reduced to such a state that
she is no longer mistress of herself; nor can she think of anything but what
tends to increase her torment&#8212;for why should she seek to live apart from her
only Good? She feels a strange loneliness, finding no companionship in any
earthly creature; nor could she, I believe, among those who dwell in heaven,
since they are not her Beloved: meanwhile all society is a torture to her. She
is like one suspended in mid-air, who can neither touch the earth nor mount to
heaven; she is unable to reach the water while parched with thirst and this is
not a thirst that can be borne, but one which nothing will quench nor would she
have it quenched save with that water of which our Lord spoke to the Samaritan
woman, but this is not given to her.<note n="381" id="x.xii-p7.1">St. <scripRef passage="John iv. 15" id="x.xii-p7.2" parsed="|John|4|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.4.15">John iv. 15</scripRef>. <i>Life</i>, ch. xxx. 24. <i>Way of
Perf.</i> ch. xix. 4 <i>sqq</i>. <i>Concept</i>. ch. vii. 7, 8. <i>Found</i>. ch. xxxi. 42. See note, <i>Life</i>, ch. i. 6.</note></p>

<p id="x.xii-p8">6.
Alas, O Lord, to what a state dost Thou bring those who love Thee! Yet these
sufferings are as nothing compared with the reward Thou wilt give for them. It
is right that great riches should be <pb n="256" id="x.xii-Page_256"/>dearly
bought. Moreover, her pains purify her soul so that it may enter the seventh
mansion, as purgatory cleanses spirits which are to enter heaven:<note n="382" id="x.xii-p8.1">St. John of
the Cross, <i>Obscure Night</i>, bk. ii. ch.
xii.</note>&#160; then indeed these trials will appear like a
drop of water compared to the sea. Though this torment and grief could not, I
think, be surpassed by any earthly cross (so at least this person said and she
had endured much both in body and mind), yet they appeared to her as nothing in
comparison with their recompense. The soul realizes that it has not merited
anguish which is of such measureless value. This conviction, although bringing
no relief; enables the sufferer to bear her trials willingly&#8212;for her entire
lifetime, if God so wills,&#8212;although instead of dying once for all, this would
be but a living death, for truly it is nothing else.</p>

<p id="x.xii-p9">7.
Let us remember, sisters, how those who are in hell lack this submission to the
divine will and the resignation and consolation God gives such a soul and the
solace of knowing that their pains benefit them, for the damned will continually
suffer more and more; (more and more, I mean in regard to accidental pains<note n="383" id="x.xii-p9.1">Marginal
note in the Saint&#8217;s handwriting. The &#8216;substantial&#8217; pain of hell consists in the
irrevocable loss of God, our last end and supreme Good; this is incurred from
the first moment in its fullest intensity and therefore cannot increase. The
physical pain with which the bodies will be afflicted when united to the souls
after the general resurrection may vary, but will neither increase nor abate.
The &#8216;accidental&#8217; pain of the damned arises from various causes, for instance
from the ever-increasing effects of evil actions, and therefore increases in
the same proportion. Thus a heresiarch will suffer keener accidental pain as
more and more souls are lost through his false teaching.</note>). The 
soul feels far more keenly than the body and the torments I have <pb n="257" id="x.xii-Page_257"/>just
described are incomparably less severe than those endured by the lost, who also
know that their anguish will last for ever: what, then, will become of these miserable
souls? What can we do or suffer during our short lives which is worth reckoning
if it will free us from such terrible and endless torments? I assure you that,
unless you have learned by experience, it would be impossible to make you
realize how acute are spiritual pangs and how different from physical pain. Our
Lord wishes us to understand this, so that we may realize what gratitude we owe
Him for having called us to a state where we may hope, by His mercy, to be
freed from and forgiven our sins.</p>

<p id="x.xii-p10">8.
Let us return to the soul we left in such cruel torment. This agony does not
continue for long in its full violence&#8212;never, I believe, longer than three or
four hours; were it prolonged, the weakness of our nature could not endure it
except by a miracle. In one case, where it lasted only a quarter of an hour,
the sufferer was left utterly exhausted; indeed, so violent was the attack that
she completely lost consciousness. This occurred when she unexpectedly heard
some verses to the effete that life seemed unending; she was engaged in
conversation at the time, which was on the last day of Easter. All Eastertide
she had suffered such aridity as hardly to realize what mystery was being
celebrated.<note n="384" id="x.xii-p10.1"><p id="x.xii-p11"><i>Rel</i>. iv. 1. <i>Concept</i>. ch. vii. 2. Isabel of Jesus, in her deposition in the Acts

difference in the two relations of this occurrence. In <i>Rel</i>. iv. St. Teresa seems to imply that it happened on Easter
Sunday evening, but here she says distinctly: &#8216;Pascua de Resurreccion, el

<p id="x.xii-p13">9.  It is as impossible to resist this suffering as it would be to
prevent the flame&#8217;s having heat enough to burn us if we were thrown into
a fire. These feelings cannot be concealed: all who are present recognize
the dangerous condition of such a person although they are unable to see
what is passing within her. True, she knows her friends are near, but
they and all earthly things seem to her but shadows. To show you that,
should you ever be in this state, it is possible for your weakness and
human nature to be of help to you, I may tell you that at times, when
a person seems dying from her desire for death<note n="385" id="x.xii-p13.1">Compare the words

which so oppresses her soul with grief that it appears on the point
of leaving her body, yet her mind, terrified at the thought, tries to
still its pain so as to keep death at bay. Evidently this fear arises
from human infirmity, for the soul&#8217;s longings for death do not abate
meanwhile nor can its sorrows be stilled or allayed until God brings it
comfort.<note n="386" id="x.xii-p13.2"><i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xix. 10. <i>Excl</i>. vi.; xii. a.;

This favour entails great suffering but leaves most precious graces within the
soul, which loses all fear of any crosses it may henceforth meet with, for in
comparison with the acute anguish it has gone through all else seems nothing.
Seeing what she has gained, the sufferer would gladly endure frequently the
same pains<note n="388" id="x.xii-p15.1"><i>Rel</i>. viii. 17.</note>&#160; but can do nothing to help herself in the
matter. There are no means of reaching that state again until God chooses to
decree it, when neither resistance nor escape is possible. The mind feels far
deeper contempt for the world than before, realizing that nothing earthly can
succour it in its torture; it is also much more detached from creatures, having
learnt that no one but its Creator can bring it consolation and strength. It is
more anxious and careful not to offend God, seeing that He can torment as well
as comfort.<note n="389" id="x.xii-p15.2"><i>Acta SS</i>. p. 64, n. 229.</note></p>

Two things in this spiritual state seem to me to endanger life,&#8212;one is that of
which I have just spoken which is a real peril and no small one; the other an
excessive gladness and a delight so extreme that the soul appears to swoon away
and seems on the point of leaving the body, which indeed would bring it no
small joy.</p>

<p class="Centered" id="xi.i-p1">TREATS
OF THE SUBLIME FAVOURS GOD BESTOWS ON SOULS WHICH HAVE ENTERED THE SEVENTH
MANSIONS. THE AUTHOR SHOWS THE DIFFERENCE SHE BELIEVES TO EXIST BETWEEN SOUL
AND SPIRIT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE BOTH ONE. THIS CHAPTER CONTAINS SOME NOTEWORTHY
THINGS.</p>

<p id="xi.i-p3">1.
You may think, sisters, that so much has been said of this spiritual journey
that nothing remains to be added. That would be a great mistake: God&#8217;s
immensity has no limits, neither have His works; therefore, who can recount His
mercies and His greatness?<note n="392" id="xi.i-p3.1"><scripRef passage="Ps. cxliv. 3" id="xi.i-p3.2" parsed="|Ps|144|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.144.3">Ps.
cxliv. 3</scripRef>: &#8216;Magnitudinis ejus non est finis.&#8217;</note>&#160; It is impossible, so do not be amazed at what
I write about them which is but a cipher of what remains untold concerning God.
He has shown great mercy in communicating these mysteries <pb n="262" id="xi.i-Page_262"/>to
one who could recount them to us, for as we learn more of His intercourse with
creatures, we ought to praise Him more fervently and to esteem more highly the
soul in which He so delights. Each of us possesses a soul but we do not realize
its value as made in the image of God, therefore we fail to understand the
important secrets it contains. May His Majesty be pleased to guide my pen and
to teach me to say somewhat of the <i>much</i>
there is to tell of His revelations to the souls He leads into this mansion. I
have begged Him earnestly to help me, since He sees that my object is to reveal
His mercies for the praise and glory of His name. I hope He will grant this
favour, if not for my own sake, at least for yours, sisters&#8212;so that you may
discover how vital it is for you to put no obstacle in the way of the Spiritual
Marriage of the Bridegroom with your soul which brings, as you will learn, such
signal blessings with it.</p>

<p id="xi.i-p4">2.
O great God! surely such a miserable creature as myself should tremble at the
thought of speaking on such a subject so far beyond anything I deserve to
understand. Indeed I felt abashed and doubted whether it would not be better to
finish writing about this Mansion in a few words, lest people might imagine
that I am recounting my personal experience. I was overwhelmed with shame for,
knowing what I am, it is a terrible undertaking. On the other hand, this fear
seemed but a temptation and weakness: even if I should be misjudged, so long as
God is but a little better praised and known, let all the world revile me. <pb n="263" id="xi.i-Page_263"/> Besides, I may be dead
before this book is seen. May He Who lives and shall live to all eternity be
praised! Amen.</p>

<p id="xi.i-p5">3.
When our Lord is pleased to take pity on the sufferings, both past and present,
endured through her longing for Him by this soul which He has spiritually taken
for His bride, He, before consummating the celestial marriage, brings her into
this His mansion or presence chamber. This is the seventh Mansion, for as He
has a dwelling-place in heaven, so has He in the soul, where none but He may abide
and which may be termed a second heaven.</p>

<p id="xi.i-p6">4.
It is important, sisters, that we should not fancy the soul to be in darkness.
As we are accustomed to believe there is no light but that which is exterior,
we imagine that the soul is wrapt in obscurity. This is indeed the case with a
soul out of the state of grace,<note n="393" id="xi.i-p6.1">See
the Saint&#8217;s description of a soul in the state of sin, <i>Rel</i>, iii. 13. (towards the end).</note>&#160; not, however, through any defer in the Sun of
Justice which remains within it and gives it being, but the soul itself is
incapable of receiving the light, as I think I said in speaking of the first
Mansion.<note n="394" id="xi.i-p6.2"><i>Supra</i>, M. i, ch. ii. 1.</note>&#160; A certain person was given to understand that
such unfortunate souls are, as it were, imprisoned in a gloomy dungeon, chained
hand and foot and unable to perform any meritorious action: they are also both
blind and dumb. Well may we pity them when we reflect that we ourselves were
once in the same state and that God may show them mercy also.</p>

<p id="xi.i-p7"> <pb n="264" id="xi.i-Page_264"/>5.
Let us, then, sisters, be most zealous in interceding for them and never
neglect it. To pray for a soul in mortal sin is a far more profitable form of
almsgiving than it would be to help a Christian whom we saw with hands strongly
fettered behind his back, tied to a post and dying of hunger&#8212;not for want of
food, because plenty of the choicest delicacies lay near him, but because he
was unable to put them into his mouth, although he was extremely exhausted and
on the point of dying, and that not a temporal death, but an eternal one. Would
it not be extremely cruel of us to stand looking at him, and give him nothing
to eat? What if by your prayers you could loose his bonds? Now you understand.</p>

<p id="xi.i-p8">6.
For the love of God I implore you constantly to remember in your prayers souls
in a like case. We are not speaking now of them but of others who, by the mercy
of God, have done penance for their sins and are in a state of grace. You must
not think of the soul as insignificant and petty but as an interior world
containing the number of beautiful mansions you have seen; as indeed it should,
since in the centre of the soul there is a mansion reserved for God Himself.</p>

<p id="xi.i-p9">7.
When His Majesty deigns to bestow on the soul the grace of these divine
nuptials, He brings it into His presence chamber and does not treat it as
before, when He put it into a trance. I believe He then united it to Himself,
as also during the prayer of union; but then only the superior part was
affected and the soul did not feel called to <pb n="265" id="xi.i-Page_265"/>enter
its own centre as it does in this mansion. Here it matters little whether it is
in the one way or the other.</p>

<p id="xi.i-p10">8.
In the former favours our Lord unites the spirit to Himself and makes it both
blind and dumb like St. Paul after his conversion,<note n="395" id="xi.i-p10.1"><scripRef passage="Acts ix. 8" id="xi.i-p10.2" parsed="|Acts|9|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.9.8">Acts ix. 8</scripRef>: &#8216;Surrexit autem
Saulus de terra, apertisque oculis nihil videbat.&#8217; There is, however, nothing
to imply that he was dumb as well as blind.</note>&#160; thus preventing its knowing whence or how it
enjoys this grace, for the supreme delight of the spirit is to realize its nearness
to God. During the actual moment of divine union the soul feels nothing, all
its powers being entirely lost. But now He acts differently: our pitiful God
removes the scales from its eyes<note n="396" id="xi.i-p10.3"><scripRef passage="Acts ix. 18" id="xi.i-p10.4" parsed="|Acts|9|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.9.18">Acts

recepit.&#8217; <i>Way of Perf.</i>. ch. xxviii.
11.</note>&#160; letting it see and understand somewhat of the
grace received in a strange and wonderful manner in this mansion by means of
intellectual vision.</p>

<p id="xi.i-p11">9.
By some mysterious manifestation of the truth, the three Persons of the most
Blessed Trinity reveal themselves, preceded by an illumination which shines on
the spirit like a most dazzling cloud of light.<note n="397" id="xi.i-p11.1"><p id="xi.i-p12"><i>Rel</i>. iii. 6; v. 6-8; viii. 20, 21; ix. 12, 17, 19. Deposition by
Fr. Giles Gonzalez, S.J., Provincial of Old Castile, afterwards
Assistant&#8212;General in Rome: &#8216;While the holy Mother lived at the convent of the
Incarnation of Avila [as prioress], I often spoke with her, and once I remember
she asked me: &#8220;What am I to do, Father? Whenever I recollect myself I
realize that already in this life the Three Persons of the Blessed Trinity may
be seen, and that They accompany me and assist me in the management of my
affairs.&#8221;&#8217; (Fuente, <i>Obras</i>, vol.
vi. p. 280.)</p>

<p id="xi.i-p13">&#8217;Do&#241;a
Maria Enriquez, Duchess of Alva, said that St. Teresa made known to her many
revelations she had received from our Lord, and that she (the duchess) held in
her possession three paintings of the Blessed Trinity made according to the
description of the holy Mother, who, while they were being done, effaced with
her own hand those portions which the painter failed to design conformably to
the vision she had had.&#8217; (Fuente, <i>l.c.</i>
p. 297.)</p></note>&#160; The three Persons are distinct from one <pb n="266" id="xi.i-Page_266"/>another;
a sublime knowledge is infused into the soul, imbuing it with a certainty of
the truth that the Three are of one substance, power, and knowledge and are one
God. Thus that which we hold as a doctrine of faith, the soul now, so to speak,
understands by sight, though it beholds the Blessed Trinity neither by the eyes
of the body nor of the soul, this being no imaginary vision. All the Three
Persons here communicate Themselves to the soul, speak to it and make it
understand the words of our Lord in the Gospel that He and the Father and the
Holy Ghost will come and make their abode with the soul which loves Him and
keeps His commandments.<note n="398" id="xi.i-p13.1">St.
<scripRef passage="John xiv. 23" id="xi.i-p13.2" parsed="|John|14|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.14.23">John xiv. 23</scripRef>: &#8216;Si quis diligit me, sermonem meum servabit, et Pater meus
diliget eum, et ad eum veniemus, et mansionem apud eum faciemus.&#8217;</note></p>

<p id="xi.i-p14">10.
O my God, how different from merely hearing and believing these words is it to
realize their truth in this way! Day by day a growing astonishment takes
possession of this soul, for the three Persons of the Blessed Trinity seem
never to depart; it sees with certainty, in the way I have described, that They
dwell far within its own centre and depths; though for want of learning it
cannot describe how, it is conscious of the indwelling of these divine
Companions.</p>

<p id="xi.i-p15">11.
You may fancy that such a person is beside herself and that her mind is too
inebriated to care for anything else. On the contrary, she is far more <pb n="267" id="xi.i-Page_267"/>active
than before in all that concerns God&#8217;s service, and when at leisure she enjoys
this blessed companionship. Unless she first deserts God, I believe He will never
cease to make her clearly sensible of His presence: she feels confident, as
indeed she may, that He will never so fail her as to allow her to lose this
favour after once bestowing it; at the same time, she is more careful than
before to avoid offending Him in any way.</p>

<p id="xi.i-p16">12.
This presence is not always so entirely realized, that is, so distinctly
manifest, as at first, or as it is at times when God renews this favour,
otherwise the recipient could not possibly attend to anything else nor live in
society. Although not always seen by so clear a light, yet whenever she
reflects on it she feels the companionship of the Blessed Trinity. This is as
if, when we were with other people in a very well lighted room, some one were
to darken it by closing the shutters; we should feel certain that the others
were still there, though we were unable to see them.<note n="399" id="xi.i-p16.1">One of the Saint&#8217;s favourite
comparisons. See <i>Life</i>, ch. xxvii. 7. <i>Castle</i>, M. vi. ch. viii. 3. <i>Rel</i>. vii. 26.</note></p>

<p id="xi.i-p17">13.
You may ask: &#8216;Could she not bring back the light and see them again?&#8217;<note n="400" id="xi.i-p17.1">&#8217;Though the
soul be always in the high estate of marriage since God has placed it there,
nevertheless, actual union in all its powers is not continuous, though the
substantial union is. In this substantial union the powers of the soul are most
frequently in union, and drink of His cellar, the understanding by knowledge,
the will by love, etc. We are not therefore to suppose that the soul, when
saying it went out, has ceased from its substantial or essential union with God,
but only from the union of its faculties, which is not, and cannot be,
permanent in this life.&#8217; (St. John of the Cross, <i>Spiritual Canticle</i>, stanza xxvi. 9. On the words: &#8216;In the inner
cellar of my Beloved have I drunk, and when I went 
forth&#8217;).</note>&#160; This is not in her <pb n="268" id="xi.i-Page_268"/>power;
when our Lord chooses, He will open the shutters of the understanding: He shows
her great mercy in never quitting her and in making her realize it so clearly.
His divine Majesty seems to be preparing His bride for greater things by this
divine companionship which clearly helps perfection in every way and makes her
lose the fear she sometimes felt when other graces were granted her.</p>

<p id="xi.i-p18">14.
A certain person so favoured found she had improved in all virtues: whatever
were her trials or labours, the centre of her soul seemed never moved from its
resting-place. Thus in a manner her soul appeared divided: a short time after
God had done her this favour, while undergoing great sufferings, she complained
of her soul as Martha did of Mary,<note n="401" id="xi.i-p18.1">St.
<scripRef passage="Luke x. 40" id="xi.i-p18.2" parsed="|Luke|10|40|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.10.40">Luke x. 40</scripRef>. <i>Excl</i>. v. 2, 3. <i>Way of Perf.</i> ch. xv. 4; xxxi. 4. <i>Rel</i>. viii. 6. <i>Concept</i>. ch. vii. 4.</note>&#160; reproaching it with enjoying solitary peace
while leaving her so full of troubles and occupations that she could not keep
it company.</p>

<p id="xi.i-p19">15.
This may seem extravagant to you, daughters, yet though the soul is known to be
undivided, it is fact and no fancy and often happens. Interior effects show for
certain that there is a positive difference between the soul and the spirit,
although they are one with each other.<note n="402" id="xi.i-p19.1"><i>Life</i>,
ch. xviii. 4. The distinction between soul and spirit, to be found in the
Epistle to the Hebrews, iv. 12, according to Cornelius a Lapide (<i>ad loc</i>.) consists in this, that the term
<i>soul</i> comprises the faculties, senses,
and passions, whereas the term <i>spirit</i>
denotes the substance of the soul independently of its powers. In the inferior
degrees of the Mystical life God operates through the faculties, while in the
Mystical marriage He acts directly on the substance of the soul. St. Teresa is
not quite consistent in the use of these terms, which is not surprising, as she
owns that she does not quite understand this subtle distinction.</note>&#160; There is an extremely <pb n="269" id="xi.i-Page_269"/>subtle
distinction between them, so that sometimes they seem to at in a different
manner from one another, as does the knowledge given to them by God.</p>

<p id="xi.i-p20">16.
It also appears to me that the soul and its faculties are not identical. There
are so many and such transcendental mysteries within us, that it would be
presumption for me to attempt to explain them. If by God&#8217;s mercy we enter
heaven we shall understand these secrets.</p>

II.</h3>

<p class="Centered" id="xi.ii-p1">TREATS
OF THE SAME SUBJECT: EXPLAINS, BY SOME DELICATELY DRAWN COMPARISONS, THE

<p id="xi.ii-p3">1.
WE now come to speak of divine and spiritual nuptials, although this sublime
favour cannot be received in all its perfection during our present life, for by
forsaking God this great good would be lost. The first time God bestows this
grace, He, by an imaginary vision of His most sacred Humanity, reveals Himself
to the soul so that it may understand and realize the sovereign gift it is <pb n="270" id="xi.ii-Page_270"/>receiving.
He may manifest Himself in a different way to other people; the person I
mentioned, after having received Holy Communion beheld our Lord, full of
splendour, beauty, and majesty, as He was after His resurrection.<note n="403" id="xi.ii-p3.1"><i>Rel</i>. iii. 20; ix. 8 and 25.</note>&#160; He told her that henceforth she was to care
for His affairs as though they were her own and He would care for hers: He
spoke other words which she understood better than she can repeat them. This
may seem nothing new, for our Lord had thus revealed Himself to her at other
times;<note n="404" id="xi.ii-p3.2"><i>Life</i>, ch. xxxix. 29.</note>&#160; yet this was so different that it left her
bewildered and amazed, both on account of the vividness of what she saw and of
the words heard at the time, also because it took place in the interior of the
soul where, with the exception of the one last mentioned, no other vision had
been seen.</p>

<p id="xi.ii-p4">2.
You must understand that between the visions seen in this and in the former
mansions there is a vast difference; there is the same distinction between
spiritual espousals and spiritual marriage as between people who are only
betrothed and others who are united for ever in holy matrimony. I have told you<note n="405" id="xi.ii-p4.1"><i>Castle</i>, M. v. ch. iv. 1.</note>&#160; that though I make this comparison because
there is none more suitable, yet this betrothal is no more related to our corporal
condition than if the soul were a disembodied spirit. This is even more true of
the spiritual marriage, for this secret union takes place in the innermost
centre of the soul where God Himself must dwell: I believe that no door is
required to enter it. I say, &#8216;no door <pb n="271" id="xi.ii-Page_271"/>is
required,&#8217; for all I have hitherto described seems to come through the senses
and faculties as must the representation of our Lord&#8217;s Humanity, but what
passes in the union of the spiritual nuptials is very different. Here God appears
in the soul&#8217;s centre, not by an imaginary but by an intellectual vision far
more mystic than those seen before, just as He appeared to the Apostles without
having entered through the door when He said: &#8216;Pax vobis.&#8217;<note n="406" id="xi.ii-p4.2">St. <scripRef passage="John xx. 19" id="xi.ii-p4.3" parsed="|John|20|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.20.19">John xx. 19</scripRef>.</note></p>

<p id="xi.ii-p5">3.
So mysterious is the secret and so sublime the favour that God thus bestows
instantaneously on the soul, that it feels a supreme delight, only to be
described by saying that our Lord vouchsafes for the moment to reveal to it His
own heavenly glory in a far more subtle way than by any vision or spiritual
delight. As far as can be understood, the soul, I mean the spirit of this soul,
is made one with God<note n="407" id="xi.ii-p5.1"><i>Rel</i>. xi. 1. <i>sqq</i>.</note>&#160; Who is Himself a spirit, and Who has been
pleased to show certain persons how far His love for us extends in order that
we may praise His greatness. He has thus deigned to unite Himself to His
creature: He has bound Himself to her as firmly as two human beings are joined
in wedlock and will never separate Himself from her.</p>

<p id="xi.ii-p6">4.
Spiritual betrothal is different and like the grace of union is often
dissolved; for though two things are made one by union, separation is still
possible and each part then remains a thing by itself. This favour generally
passes quickly, and afterwards the soul, as far as it is aware, remains without
His company.</p>

<p id="xi.ii-p7"> <pb n="272" id="xi.ii-Page_272"/>5.
This is not so in the spiritual marriage with our Lord, where the soul always
remains in its centre with its God. Union may be symbolized by two wax candles,
the tips of which touch each other so closely that there is but one light; or
again, the wick, the wax, and the light become one, but the one candle can
again be separated from the other and the two candles remain distinct; or the
wick may be withdrawn from the wax. But spiritual marriage is like rain falling
from heaven into a river or stream, becoming one and the same liquid, so that
the river and rain water cannot be divided; or it resembles a streamlet flowing
into the ocean, which cannot afterwards be disunited from it. This marriage may
also be likened to a room into which a bright light enters through two
windows&#8212;though divided when it enters, the light becomes one and the same.</p>

<p id="xi.ii-p8">6.
Perhaps when St. Paul said, &#8216;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit,&#8217;<note n="408" id="xi.ii-p8.1"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 17" id="xi.ii-p8.2" parsed="|1Cor|6|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.17">1 Cor. vi.
17</scripRef>: &#8216;Qui adh&#230;ret Domino unus spiritus est.&#8217;</note>&#160; he meant this sovereign marriage, which
presupposes His Majesty&#8217;s having been joined to the soul by union. The same
Apostle says: &#8216;To me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.&#8217;<note n="409" id="xi.ii-p8.3"><scripRef passage="Philip. i. 21" id="xi.ii-p8.4" parsed="|Phil|1|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.1.21">Philip. i. 21</scripRef>: &#8216;Mihi vivere
Christus est, et mori lucrum.&#8217;</note>&#160; This, I think, might here be uttered by the
soul, for now the little butterfly of which I spoke dies with supreme joy, for
Christ is her life.</p>

<p id="xi.ii-p9">7.
This becomes more manifest by its effects as time goes on, for the soul learns that
it is God Who gives it &#8216;life,&#8217; by certain secret intuitions too strong to be
misunderstood, and keenly felt, although impossible to describe. These produce
such over-mastering
<pb n="273" id="xi.ii-Page_273"/>feelings that the person experiencing them cannot 
refrain from amorous
exclamations, such as: &#8216;O Life of my life, and Power which doth uphold me!&#8217;
with other aspirations of the same kind.<note n="410" id="xi.ii-p9.1">Such exclamations, in considerable number,
form the <i>Book of Exclamations</i>
published by Fray Luis de Leon. De Fuente thinks it was written in 1569, but as
St. Teresa&#8217;s spiritual betrothal took place on November 18, 1572, it seems, at
least in parts, of a later date. The spiritual nuptials must be placed between
the aforementioned year and May 1575, but it is not possible to ascertain the
exact date. (For the <i>Exclamations</i>,
see <i>Minor Works</i>).</note>&#160; For from the bosom of the Divinity, where God
seems ever to hold this soul fast clasped, issue streams of milk, which solace
the servants of the castle. I think He wishes them to share, in some way, the
riches the soul enjoys; therefore from the flowing river in which the little
streamlet is swallowed up, some drops of water flow every now and then to
sustain the bodily powers, the servants of the bride and Bridegroom.</p>

<p id="xi.ii-p10">8.
A person who was unexpectedly plunged into water could not fail to be aware of
it; here the case is the same, but even more evident. A quantity of water could
not fall on us unless it came from some source&#8212;so the soul feels certain there
must be some one within it who lances forth these darts and vivifies its own
life, and that there is a Sun whence this brilliant light streams forth from
the interior of the spirit to its faculties.</p>

<p id="xi.ii-p11">9.
The soul itself, as I said, never moves from this centre, nor loses the peace
He can give Who gave it to the Apostles when they were assembled together.<note n="411" id="xi.ii-p11.1">St. <scripRef passage="John xx. 19" id="xi.ii-p11.2" parsed="|John|20|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.20.19">John xx.
19</scripRef>.</note>&#160; I think this salutation of our Lord contains
far deeper meaning than the words convey, as <pb n="274" id="xi.ii-Page_274"/>also
His bidding the glorious Magdalen to &#8216;go in peace.&#8217;<note n="412" id="xi.ii-p11.3">St. <scripRef passage="Luke vii. 50" id="xi.ii-p11.4" parsed="|Luke|7|50|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.7.50">Luke vii. 50</scripRef>.</note>&#160; Our Lord&#8217;s words <i>act</i> within us,<note n="413" id="xi.ii-p11.5"><i>Supra</i>, M. vi. ch. iii. 6. <i>Life</i>, ch. xxv. 5.</note>&#160; and in these cases they must have wrought
their effect in the souls already disposed to banish from within themselves all
that is corporal and to retain only what is spiritual, in order to be joined in
this celestial union with the uncreated Spirit. Without doubt, if we empty
ourselves of all that belongs to the creature, depriving ourselves of it for
the love of God, that same Lord will fill us with Himself.</p>

<p id="xi.ii-p12">10.

God help me! how true these words are, and how clearly are they understood by
the soul which in this state of prayer finds them fulfilled in itself! So
should we all but for our own fault, for the words of Jesus Christ, our King
and our Lord, cannot fail. It is we who fail by not disposing ourselves fitly,
nor removing all that can obstruct this light,<pb n="275" id="xi.ii-Page_275"/>so
that we do not behold ourselves in this mirror wherein our image is
engraved.<note n="417" id="xi.ii-p13.1"><p id="xi.ii-p14">This idea is

<l id="xi.ii-p14.11">Soul, seek thyself in Me.</l>
</verse>

</note></p>

<p id="xi.ii-p15">12.
To return to what I was saying. God places the soul in His own mansion which is
in the very centre of the soul itself. They say the empyreal heavens, in which
our Lord dwells, do not revolve with the rest: so the accustomed movements of
the faculties and imagination do not appear to take place in any way that can
injure the soul or disturb its peace.</p>

<p id="xi.ii-p16">13.
Do I seem to imply that after God has brought the soul thus far it is certain
to be saved and cannot fall into sin again?<note n="418" id="xi.ii-p16.1"><p id="xi.ii-p17">In a letter dated May 1581,
addressed to Don Alonso Velasquez, then bishop of Osma, St. Teresa writes as
follows:</p>

<p id="xi.ii-p18">&#8217;She
[herself] has received such an assurance of coming one day to the fruition of
God that she almost imagines she has already come into possession of Him,
without, however, the joy that will accompany it. She is in the same position
as one who by legal contract has received a splendid property which will become
his, and whose fruit he will enjoy at a given date. Until then he only holds
the title-deeds, without being able to take possession of the property.
Nevertheless my soul would not like to come immediately into the possession of
God, for it does not believe that it has deserved such a grace. It only desires
to continue in His service, even at the cost of terrible sufferings. It would
not mind thus serving Him to the end of the world, after having received such a
pledge.&#8217; St. John of the Cross, in treating of this subject (<i>Spir.</i> <i>Cant</i>. stanza xxii. 3) says: &#8216;I believe that no soul ever attains to
this state without being confirmed in grace in it.&#8217; See also Ribera,
in the <i>Acta Ss</i>. p. 554, <i>circa finem</i>.</p></note>&#160; I do not mean this: whenever <pb n="276" id="xi.ii-Page_276"/> I say that the soul seems in security,
I must be understood to imply for as long as His Majesty thus holds it in His
care and it does not offend Him. At any rate I know for certain that though
such a person realizes the high state she is in and has remained in it for
several years, she does not consider herself safe, but is more careful than
ever to avoid committing the least offence against God. As I shall explain
later on, she is most anxious to serve Him and feels a constant pain and
confusion at seeing how little she can do for Him compared with all she ought.&#8217;
This is no light cross but a severe mortification, for the harder the penances
she can perform, the better is she pleased. Her greatest penance is to be
deprived by God of health and strength to perform any. I told you elsewhere what
keen pain this caused her, but now it grieves her far more. This must be
because she is like a tree grafted on a stock growing near a stream which makes
it greener and more fruitful.<note n="419" id="xi.ii-p18.1"><scripRef passage="Ps. i. 3" id="xi.ii-p18.2" parsed="|Ps|1|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.1.3">Ps.
i. 3</scripRef>: &#8216;Et erit tamquam lignum quod plantatum est secus decursus aquarum, quod
fructum suum dabit in tempore suo.&#8217;</note>&#160; Why marvel at the longings of this soul whose
spirit has truly become one with the celestial water I described?</p>

<p id="xi.ii-p19">14.
To return to what I wrote about. It is not intended that the powers, senses and
passions should continually enjoy this peace. The soul does so, indeed, but in
the other mansions there are still times of struggle, suffering, and fatigue,
though as a general rule, peace is not lost by them. This &#8216;centre of the soul&#8217;
or &#8216;spirit&#8217; is so hard to describe <pb n="277" id="xi.ii-Page_277"/>or
even to believe in, that I think, sisters, my inability to explain my meaning
saves your being tempted to disbelieve me; it is difficult to understand how
there can be crosses and sufferings and yet peace in the soul.</p>

<p id="xi.ii-p20">15.
Let me give you one or two comparisons&#8212;God grant they may be of use; if not, I
know that what I say is true. A king resides in his palace; many wars and
disasters take place in his kingdom but he remains on his throne. In the same
way, though tumults and wild beasts rage with great uproar in the other
mansions, yet nothing of this enters the seventh mansions, nor drives the soul
from it. Although the mind regrets these troubles, they do not disturb it nor
rob it of its peace, for the passions are too subdued to dare to enter here
where they would only suffer still further defeat. Though the whole body is in
pain, yet the head, if it be sound, does not suffer with it. I smile at these
comparisons&#8212;they do not please me&#8212;but I can find no others. Think what you
will about it&#8212;I have told you the truth.</p>

<h3 id="xi.iii-p0.1">CHAPTER
III.</h3>

<p class="Centered" id="xi.iii-p1">THE
GREAT FRUITS PRODUCED BY THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PRAYER. THE WONDERFUL DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THESE EFFECTS AND THOSE FORMERLY DESCRIBED SHOULD BE CAREFULLY STUDIED
AND REMEMBERED.</p>

<p id="xi.iii-p3">1.
THE little butterfly has died with the greatest joy at having found rest at
last, and now Christ lives in her.<note n="420" id="xi.iii-p3.1"><scripRef passage="Gal. ii. 20" id="xi.iii-p3.2" parsed="|Gal|2|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.2.20">Gal.
ii. 20</scripRef>.</note>&#160; Let us see the difference between her present
and her former life, for the effects will prove whether what I told you was
true. As far as can be ascertained they are these: first, a self-forgetfulness
so complete that she really appears not to exist, as I said,<note n="421" id="xi.iii-p3.3"><i>Castle</i>, M. vii. ch. i. 11 and 15.</note>&#160; for such a transformation has been worked in
her that she no longer recognizes herself; nor does she remember that heaven,
or life, or glory are to be hers, but seems entirely occupied in seeking God&#8217;s
interests. Apparently the words spoken by His Majesty have done their work:
&#8217;that she was to care for His affairs, and He would care for hers.&#8217;<note n="422" id="xi.iii-p3.4"><i>Castle</i>, M. vii. ch. ii. 1. Compare the
references there given.</note>
</p>

<p id="xi.iii-p4">2.
Thus she recks nothing, whatever happens, but lives in such strange oblivion
that, as I stated, she seems no longer to exist, nor does she wish to be of <pb n="279" id="xi.iii-Page_279"/>any
account in anything&#8212;<i>anything</i>! unless
she sees that she can advance, however little, the honour and glory of God, for
which she would most willingly die.</p>

<p id="xi.iii-p5">3.
Do not fancy I mean, daughters, that she neglects to eat and drink, though it
brings no small torment to her, or to perform the duties of her state. I am
speaking of her interior; as regards her exterior actions there is little to
say, for her chief suffering is to see that she has hardly strength to do
anything. For nothing in the world would she omit doing all she can which she
knows would honour our Lord.</p>

<p id="xi.iii-p6">4.
The second fruit is a strong desire for suffering, though it does not disturb
her peace as before because the fervent wish of such souls for the fulfilment
of God&#8217;s will in them makes them acquiesce in all He does. If He would have her
suffer, she is content; if not, she does not torment herself to death about it
as she used to do. She feels a great interior joy when persecuted, and is far
more peaceful than in the former state under such circumstances: she bears no
grudge against her enemies, nor wishes them any ill. Indeed she has a special
love for them, is deeply grieved at seeing them in trouble, and does all she
can to relieve them,<note n="423" id="xi.iii-p6.1">Don
Alvaro de Mendoza, Bishop of Avila, used to say that the best means of
obtaining St. Teresa&#8217;s friendship was to injure or insult her, <i>Acta Ss</i>. n, 1233. <i>Rel</i>. vii. 20.</note>&#160; earnestly interceding with God on their
behalf. She would be glad to forfeit the favours His Majesty shows her, if they
might be given to her enemies instead, to prevent their offending our Lord. <pb n="280" id="xi.iii-Page_280"/>5.
The most surprising thing to me is that the sorrow and distress which such
souls felt because they could not die and enjoy our Lord&#8217;s presence<note n="424" id="xi.iii-p6.2">Rel. viii.
15.</note>&#160; are now exchanged for as fervent a desire of
serving Him, of causing Him to be praised, and of helping others to the utmost
of their power. Not only have they ceased to long for death, but they wish for
a long life and most heavy crosses, if such would bring ever so little honour
to our Lord. Thus, if they knew for certain that immediately on quitting their
bodies their souls would enjoy God, it would make no difference to them, nor do
they think of the glory enjoyed by the saints, and long to share it. Such souls
hold that their glory consists in helping, in any way, Him Who was crucified,
especially as they see how men offend against Him, and how few, detached from
all else, care for His honour alone. True, people in this state forget this at
times, and are seized with tender longings to enjoy God and to leave this land
of exile, especially as they see how little they serve Him. Then, returning to
themselves and reflecting how they possess Him continually in their souls, they
are satisfied, offering to His Majesty their willingness to live as the most
costly oblation they can make.<note n="425" id="xi.iii-p6.3"><p id="xi.iii-p7">Compare
with the Saint&#8217;s poem on self-oblation: &#8216;Vuestro soy, para Vos naci&#8217; (Poem i.
Minor Works).</p>

<verse id="xi.iii-p7.1">
<l id="xi.iii-p7.2">Long life bestow, or straightway let me die;</l>
<l id="xi.iii-p7.3">Let health be mine, or pain and sickness send;</l>
<l id="xi.iii-p7.4">Honour or foul dishonour&#8212;be my path</l>
<l id="xi.iii-p7.5">Beset by war or peaceful till the end.</l>
<l id="xi.iii-p7.6">My strength or weakness be as Thou dost choose,</l>
<l id="xi.iii-p7.7">Since naught Thou askest shall I e&#8217;er refuse.</l>
<l id="xi.iii-p7.8">Say, Lord, what is it Thou dost will for me?</l>
</verse>

</note></p>

<p id="xi.iii-p8">&#160; They fear death no more than they would a
delicious trance.</p>

<p id="xi.iii-p9"> <pb n="281" id="xi.iii-Page_281"/>[6.
The fact is, that He Who gave them these torturing desires of death has
exchanged them for the others. May He be for ever blessed and praised! Amen. In
fact, such persons no longer wish for consolations nor delights, since they
bear God Himself within them, and it is He Who lives in them. It is evident
that His life was one continual torment: so would He have ours to be, at least
in desire, for as to the rest He leads us mercifully as our weakness requires,
though when He sees the need He imparts to us His strength.]</p>

<p id="xi.iii-p10">7.
Such a soul, thoroughly detached from all things, wishes to be either always
alone or occupied on what benefits the souls of others: she feels neither
aridity nor any interior troubles, but a constant tender recollection of our
Lord Whom she wishes to praise unceasingly. When she grows negligent, the same
Lord arouses her in the way that I told you, and it is easy to see that this
impulse (I know not what term to use for it) comes from the interior of the
soul, like the former impetuous desires.<note n="426" id="xi.iii-p10.1"><i>Castle</i>,
M. vi. ch. vi. 6.</note>&#160; It is now felt very sweetly, but is neither
produced by the intellect nor the memory, nor is there reason to believe the
soul itself has any share in it. This is so usual and so frequent that whoever
has been in this state must have noticed it. However large a fire may be, the
flame never burns downwards, but upwards, and so this movement is seen to come
from the centre of the soul whose powers it excites. Indeed, were nothing else
gained by this way of prayer but the knowledge of the special care God takes to
communicate Himself to us and how He entreats us to abide with Him (for indeed
I can describe it in no other way) I think that for the sake of these sweet and
penetrating touches of His love all our past pains would be well spent.</p>

<p id="xi.iii-p11">8.
You will have learnt this by experience, sisters, for I think that when our
Lord has brought us to the prayer of union, He watches over us in this way
unless we neglect to keep His commandments. When these impulses are given you,
remember that they come from the innermost mansion, where <pb n="282" id="xi.iii-Page_282"/> God dwells in our souls. Praise Him
fervently, for it is He Who sends you this message, or love letter, so tenderly
written, and in a cipher that only you can understand and know what He asks. By
no means neglect to answer His Majesty, even though you may be occupied
exteriorly and engaged in conversation. Our Lord may often be pleased to show
you this secret favour in public; but it is very easy, as the reply should be
entirely interior, to respond by an at of love or to ask with Saint Paul:
&#8217;Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?&#8221;<note n="427" id="xi.iii-p11.1"><scripRef passage="Acts ix. 6" id="xi.iii-p11.2" parsed="|Acts|9|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.9.6">Acts ix. 6</scripRef>: &#8216;Domine, quid me
vis facere?&#8217;&#8217;</note>&#160; Jesus will show you in many ways how to
please Him. It is a propitious moment, for He seems to be listening to us and
the soul is nearly always disposed by this delicate touch to respond with a
generous determination.<note n="428" id="xi.iii-p11.3">The
words from &#8216;know what He asks&#8217; to &#8216;as I told you&#8217; are not in the original manuscript,
but must have been written on a separate slip, as is proved by a marginal note
in the handwriting of the Saint: &#8216;Quando dice aqui: os pide, l&#233;ase luego este
papel.&#8217; This paper is now lost, but the passage it contained is preserved in
the early manuscript copies of Toledo, Cordova and Salamanca, as well as in the
first printed edition, and, through this, in the old translations; hence both
Woodhead and Dalton have it in its proper place. It is, of course, not to be
found in the autograph published in 1882, nor in Fuente&#8217;s Spanish editions nor
in translations based upon these, The Spanish text will be found in <i>&#338;uvres</i> vi, 297 note.</note>&#160; As I told you, this mansion differs from the
rest in that, as I said,<note n="429" id="xi.iii-p11.4">Supra
&#167;&#167; i and 2.</note>&#160; the dryness and disturbance felt in all the
rest at times hardly ever enter here, where the soul is nearly always calm. It
does not fear that this sublime favour can be counterfeited by the devil, but
feels a settled conviction that it is of divine origin because, as above
stated, nothing is here perceived <pb n="283" id="xi.iii-Page_283"/>by
the senses or faculties but His Majesty reveals Himself to the spirit, which He
takes to be with Himself in a place where I doubt not the devil dares not
enter, nor would our Lord ever permit him.</p>

<p id="xi.iii-p12">9.
All the graces here divinely bestowed on the soul come, as I said, through no a
Lion of its own except its total abandonment of itself to God. They are given
in peace and silence, like the building of Solomon&#8217;s Temple where no sound was
heard.<note n="430" id="xi.iii-p12.1">III
Reg. vi. 7.</note>&#160; It is thus with this temple of God, this
mansion of His where He and the soul rejoice in each other alone in profound
silence. The mind need not act nor search for anything, as the Lord Who created
it wishes it to be at rest and only to watch through a little chink, what
passes within. Though at times it cannot see this, yet such intervals are very
short, I believe because the powers are not here lost but only cease to work,
being, as it were, dazed with astonishment.</p>

<p id="xi.iii-p13">10.
I, too, am astonished at seeing that when the soul arrives at this state it
does not go into ecstasies except perhaps on rare occasions&#8212;even then they are
not like the former trances and the flight of the spirit and seldom take place
in public as they did before.<note n="431" id="xi.iii-p13.1">&#8217;That
is, so as to lose the senses&#8217; (marginal note in the Saints&#8217; handwriting). Rel.
iii. 5.</note>&#160; They are no longer produced by any special
calls to devotion, such as by the sight of a religious picture, by hearing a
sermon (were it only the first few words), or by sacred music; formerly, like
the poor little butterfly, the soul <pb n="284" id="xi.iii-Page_284"/>was
so anxious that anything used to alarm it and make it take flight. This may be
either because the spirit has at last found repose, or that it has seen such
wonders in this mansion that nothing can frighten it, or perhaps because it no
longer feels solitary since it rejoices in such Company.</p>

<p id="xi.iii-p14">11.
In short, sisters, I cannot tell the reason, but as soon as God shows the soul
what this mansion contains, bringing it to dwell within the precincts, the
infirmity formerly so troublesome to the mind and impossible to get over,
disappears at once. Probably this is because our Lord has now strengthened,
dilated, and developed the soul, or it may be that He wished to make public
(for some end known only to Himself) what He was doing in secret within such
souls, for His judgments are beyond our comprehension in this life.</p>

<p id="xi.iii-p15">12.
These effects, with all the other good fruits I have mentioned of the different
degrees of prayer, are given by God to the soul when it draws near Him to
receive that &#8216;kiss of His mouth&#8217; for which the bride asked,<note n="432" id="xi.iii-p15.1"><scripRef passage="Cant. i." id="xi.iii-p15.2" parsed="|Song|1|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Song.1">Cant. i.</scripRef> I. </note>&#160; and I believe her petition is now granted.
Here the overflowing waters are given to the wounded hart: here she delights in
the tabernacles of God<note n="433" id="xi.iii-p15.3">Ps.
xli, 2, 5.</note>
: here the dove sent out by Noe to see whether the flood had subsided, has
plucked the olive branch, showing that she has found firm land amongst the
floods and tempests of this world.<note n="434" id="xi.iii-p15.4"><scripRef passage="Gen. viii. 10, 11" id="xi.iii-p15.5" parsed="|Gen|8|10|8|11" osisRef="Bible:Gen.8.10-Gen.8.11">Gen.
viii. 10, 11</scripRef>.</note>&#160; O Jesus! Who knows how much in Holy Scripture
refers to this peace of soul? Since, O my God, Thou dost see of what grave
import is this peace <pb n="285" id="xi.iii-Page_285"/>to
us, do Thou incite Christians to strive to gain it! In Thy mercy do not deprive
those of it on whom Thou hast bestowed it, for until Thou hast given them true
peace and brought them to where it is unending, they must ever live in fear.</p>

<p id="xi.iii-p16">13.
I do not mean that peace is unreal on earth because I say &#8216;true peace,&#8217; but
that such souls might have to begin all their struggles over again if they
forsook God. What must these people feel at the thought that it is possible to
lose so great a good? Their dread makes them more careful; they try to gather
strength from their weakness lest, through their own fault, they should miss
any opportunity of pleasing God better. The greater the favours they have
received from His Majesty, the more diffident and mistrustful are they of
themselves; the marvels they have witnessed having revealed more clearly to
them their own miseries and the heinousness of their sins, so that often, like
the publican, they dare not so much as lift up their eyes.<note n="435" id="xi.iii-p16.1">St. <scripRef passage="Luke. xviii. 13" id="xi.iii-p16.2" parsed="|Luke|18|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.18.13">Luke. xviii. 13</scripRef>.</note></p>

<p id="xi.iii-p17">14.
Sometimes they long to die and be in safety, but then their love at once makes
them wish to live in order to serve God, as I told you; therefore they commit
all that concerns them to His mercy.<note n="436" id="xi.iii-p17.1"><i>Rel</i>.
ix. 19.</note>&#160; At times they are more crushed than ever by
the thought of the many graces they have received lest, like an overladen ship,
they sink beneath the burden. I assure you, sisters, such souls have their
cross to bear, yet it does not trouble them nor rob them of their peace, but is
quickly gone like a wave or a storm which is followed by a calm, for God&#8217;s
<pb n="286" id="xi.iii-Page_286"/>presence
within them soon makes them forget all else. May He be for ever blessed and
praised by all His creatures! Amen,</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p3">1.
You must not suppose, sisters, that the effects I mentioned always exist in the
same degree in these souls, for as far as I remember, I told you that in most
cases our Lord occasionally leaves such persons to the weakness of their
nature. The venomous creatures from the moat round the castle and the other
mansions at once unite to revenge themselves for the time when they were
deprived of their power.</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p4">2.
True, this lasts but a short time&#8212;a day perhaps or a little longer&#8212;but during
this disturbance, which generally arises from some passing event, these persons
learn what benefits they derive from <pb n="287" id="xi.iv-Page_287"/>the
holy Company they are in. Our Lord gives them such great fortitude that they
never desert His service nor the good resolutions they have made, which only
seem to gather strength by trial, nor do their hearts ever turn from them, even
by a slight movement of the will. This trouble rarely happens; our Lord wishes
the soul to keep in mind its natural condition so that it may be humble and may
better understand how much it owes Him, and how great a grace it has received,
and so may praise Him.</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p5">3.
Do not fancy that in spite of the strong desire and determination of these
souls that they do not commit imperfections and even fall into many sins: that
is, not <i>wilfully</i>; for such people are
given special grace from God on this point: I mean venial sins. As far as they
are aware, they are free from mortal sins, although they do not feel certain
they may not be guilty of some of which they are ignorant.</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p6">4.
This grieves their hearts sorely, as does the sight of the souls perishing
around them; although on the one hand they have strong hopes of not being
themselves among the number of the lost, yet remembering what we are told in
Holy Scripture of the fate of men who, like Solomon, seemed the special
favourites of God<note n="437" id="xi.iv-p6.1">III.
Reg. xi.</note>&#160; and conversed so familiarly with His Majesty,
they cannot help fearing for themselves.</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p7">5.
Let that one among you who feels most confidence on this point fear the most,
for: &#8216;Blessed <pb n="288" id="xi.iv-Page_288"/>is
the man who feareth the Lord,&#8217; as David said.<note n="438" id="xi.iv-p7.1"><scripRef passage="Ps. cxi. 1" id="xi.iv-p7.2" parsed="|Ps|111|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.111.1">Ps. cxi. 1</scripRef>. &#8216;Beatus vir qui
timet Dominum.&#8217;</note>&#160; May His Majesty ever protect us. Let us beg
Him never to permit us to offend Him: therein lies our greatest safety. May He
be for ever praised. Amen.</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p8">6.
It would be well to tell you, sisters, the reason why God bestows such favours
on souls in this world, although you must have learned this by the effects
produced if you have considered the matter. I return to the matter in order
that none of you may think it is only for the sake of the pleasure such persons
feel, which would be a great mistake on your part, for His Majesty can bestow
no greater favour on us than to give us a life such as was led by His beloved
Son. Therefore, as I have often told you, I feel certain that these graces are
sent to strengthen our weakness so that we may imitate Him by suffering much.</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p9">7.
We always find that those nearest to Christ our Lord bear the heaviest cross:
think of what His glorious Mother and the Apostles bore. How do you think St.
Paul went through such immense labours?<note n="439" id="xi.iv-p9.1">Though thou shouldst have been rapt up to the
third heaven with Saint Paul, thou art not thereby secured that thou shalt
suffer no adversity. &#8216;I,&#8217; said Jesus, &#8216;will shew him how great things he must
suffer for My name&#8217;s sake&#8217; (<scripRef passage="Acts. ix. 16" id="xi.iv-p9.2" parsed="|Acts|9|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.9.16">Acts. ix. 16</scripRef>). To suffer, therefore, is what waits
for thee, if thou wilt love Jesus and constantly serve Him For our merit and
the advancement of our state consist not in having many sweetnesses and
consolations, but rather in bearing great afflictions and tribulations&#8217;
(Imitation, bk. ii. ch. xii. 12).</note>&#160; We learn from his conduct the fruits of
genuine visions and contemplation which come from our Lord and not from our own
imagination, or the devil&#8217;s fraud. Do you suppose that St. Paul hid himself to
enjoy these spiritual consolations at <pb n="289" id="xi.iv-Page_289"/>leisure
and did nothing else? You know that he never took a day&#8217;s rest so far as we can
learn, nor could he have slept much since he worked all night to get his
living.<note n="440" id="xi.iv-p9.3">i
Thess. ii. 9.</note>
</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p10">8.
I am delighted with St. Peter, who when fleeing from prison was met by our
Lord, Who told him He was going to Rome to be crucified again. I never recite
the Office in which this is commemorated without feeling a special joy.<note n="441" id="xi.iv-p10.1">The Antiphon
of the Magnificat at first Vespers of the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, June
29, in the Carmelite Breviary used by St. Teresa is: &#8216;Beatus Petrus Apostolus
vidit sibi Christum occurrere. Adorans
eum ait: &#8220;Domine, quo vadis?&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;Venio Romam iterum
crucifigi.&#8221; &#8216;The Blessed Apostle Peter saw Christ come to meet him.
Adoring Him, he asked &#8220;Lord, where art Thou going?&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;I go to
Rome to be crucified anew.&#8221; The saint at once returned to Rome and was
taken by the soldiers and crucified. See <i>Letter</i>
of Jan. 17. 1577, note 4. Vol. II.</note>&#160; What effect did this vision have on St.
Peter, and what did he do? He went at once to meet his death&#8212;and our Lord did
him no small favour in finding him an executioner!</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p11">9.
Oh, my sisters, how forgetful of her ease, how unmindful of honours, and how
far from seeking men&#8217;s esteem should she be whose soul God thus chooses for His
special dwelling-place! For if her mind is fixed on Him, as it ought to be, she
must needs forget herself: all her thoughts are bent on how to please Him
better and when and how she can show the love she bears Him.</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p12">10.
<i>This</i> is the end and aim of prayer, my
daughters; <i>this</i> is the reason of the
spiritual marriage whose children are always good works. <i>Works</i> are the unmistakable sign which shows these favours come from
God, as I told you. It will do me little
<pb n="290" id="xi.iv-Page_290"/>good
to be deeply recollected when alone, making acts of the virtues, planning and
promising to do wonders in God&#8217;s service, if afterwards, when occasion offers,
I do just the opposite. I did wrong in saying, &#8216;It will do me <i>little</i> good,&#8217; for all the time we spend
with God does us <i>great</i> good. Though
afterwards we may weakly fail to perform our good intentions, yet some time or
other His Majesty will find a way for us to practise them although perhaps much
to our regret. Thus when He sees a soul very cowardly, He often sends it some
great affliction, much against its will, and brings it through this trial with
profit to itself, When the soul has learnt this, it is less timid in offering
itself to Him.</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p13">11.
I ought to have said, &#8216;will do us <i>little</i>
good&#8217; in comparison with the far <i>greater</i>
good we can gain when our works fulfil our aspirations and our promises. She
that cannot do all this at once should do it little by little, gradually
dominating her will, if she wishes to gain fruit from prayer. Even in this
little nook she will find many a chance to praise this. Remember, this is of
far more importance than I know how to express. Fix your eyes on the Crucified
One, and all will seem easy. If His Majesty proved His love for us by such
stupendous labours and sufferings, how can you seek to please Him by words alone?</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p14">12.
Do you know what it is to be truly spiritual? It is for men to make themselves
the <i>slaves</i> of God&#8212;branded with His
mark, which is the cross. Since they have given Him their freedom, He can sell <pb n="291" id="xi.iv-Page_291"/>them
as slaves to the whole world, as He was, which would be doing them no wrong but
the greatest favour. Unless you make up your minds to this, never expect to
make much progress,<note n="442" id="xi.iv-p14.1">&#8220;If
thou wilt stand upon self and wilt not offer thyself freely to My will, thine
offering is not perfect, nor will there be entire union between us.&#8217; (<i>Imitation</i>, bk. iv. ch. viii. 2.)</note>&#160; for as I said humility is the foundation of
the whole building and unless you are truly humble, our Lord, for your own
sake, will never permit you to rear it very high lest it should fall to the
ground.</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p15">13.
Therefore, sisters, take care to lay a firm foundation by seeking to be the
least of all and the slave of others, watching how you can please and help
them, for it will benefit you more than them. Built on such strong rocks, your
castle can never go to ruin. I insist again: your foundation must not consist
of prayer and contemplation alone: unless you acquire the virtues and praise
them, you will always be dwarfs; and please God no worse may befall you than
making no progress, for you know that to <i>stop</i>
is to go <i>back</i>&#8212;if you love, you will
never be content to come to a standstill.</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p16">14.
Perhaps you think I am speaking of beginners and that one may rest later on,
but, as I told you, the rest such souls feel is within them: they have less outwardly
nor do they wish for it. Why, do you think, does the soul send from its centre
these inspirations, or rather aspirations, (the messages of which I spoke), to
the dwellers in the precincts of the castle and to the surrounding mansions? To
send them to sleep? No, no, no! The soul wages a fiercer war from thence to
keep the powers, <pb n="292" id="xi.iv-Page_292"/>senses
and the whole body from being idle, than ever it did when it suffered in their
company. Formerly it did not understand the immense benefit its afflictions
brought, though indeed they may have been the means God used to advance it to
this state.</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p17">15.
Besides, the company it enjoys gives it far greater strength than ever before.
If, as David says: &#8216;With the holy thou shalt be holy,&#8217;<note n="443" id="xi.iv-p17.1"><scripRef passage="Ps. xvii. 26" id="xi.iv-p17.2" parsed="|Ps|17|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.17.26">Ps. xvii. 26</scripRef>: &#8216;Cum sancto sanctus
eris.&#8217;</note>&#160; doubtless by its becoming one with the
Almighty, by this sovereign union of spirit with spirit, the soul must gather
strength, as we know the saints did, to suffer and to die. Beyond doubt, with
the force thus gained, the soul succours all within the castle and even the
very body itself, which often seems to have no feeling left in it. The vigour
the soul derives from &#8216;the wine&#8217; drunk in the &#8216;cellar&#8217;<note n="444" id="xi.iv-p17.3"><scripRef passage="Cant. ii. 4" id="xi.iv-p17.4" parsed="|Song|2|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Song.2.4">Cant. ii. 4</scripRef>.</note>&#160; (into which the Bridegroom brought her and
would not let her go) overflows into the feeble body, just as the food we eat
nourishes both the head and the whole frame.</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p18">16.
Indeed the body suffers much while alive, for whatever work it does, the soul
has energy for far greater tasks and goads it on to more, for all it can
perform appears as nothing. This must be the reason of the severe penances
performed by many of the saints, especially the glorious Magdalen, who had
always spent her life in luxury.<note n="445" id="xi.iv-p18.1">&#8217;St.
Mary Magdalen gave herself up to penance and contemplation in a deep excavation
of the rocks at La Baume, near Marseilles. In this wild spot there was neither
bread, water, nor even herbage. Thus she lived for more than thirty-two years
without any kind of nourishment but that which was celestial, performing meanwhile
most severe penances.&#8217; (St. Vincent Ferrer.)</note>&#160; This <pb n="293" id="xi.iv-Page_293"/>caused
the zeal felt by our Father Elias for the honour of God,<note n="446" id="xi.iv-p18.2">III Reg. xix. 10.</note>&#160; and the desires of St. Dominic,<note n="447" id="xi.iv-p18.3">&#8217;There was
one sentiment within him to which may almost be given the name of passion: it
was his ceaseless burning thirst for the salvation of souls. As his Divine
Master had come into the world to save sinners and loved them even unto death,
so he, too, gave up all that was most dear to him in his life to win souls to
Christ. He was always giving himself: it was the very key-note of his
existence. He would have sold himself as a slave, he would have been cut to
pieces by the heretics, he would spare himself neither by day nor by night, if
by any means he might save some.&#8217; (From the <i>History
of St. Dominic</i>, by Augusta Theodosia Drane. London, 1891, p. 256).</note>&#160; and St. Francis<note n="448" id="xi.iv-p18.4">&#8217;St. Francis of Assisi, at
the very beginning of his Order, when he had only seven followers, said to
them: &#8220;Consider, my brethren, what is our vocation. It is not only for our
own salvation that the mercy of God has called us, but for the salvation of
many other souls. It is that we may go forth and exhort all men rather by our
example than by our words, to do penance and keep the divine commands.&#8221;&#8217; (<i>The Life of St. Francis of Assisi</i>, by a
religious of the Order of Poor Clares, London, 1861, p. 32).</note>&#160; to draw souls to praise the Almighty. I
assure you that, forgetful of themselves, they must have passed through no
small trials.</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p19">17.
This, my sisters, is what I would have us strive for&#8212;to offer our petitions
and to practise prayer, not for our own enjoyment but to gain strength to serve
God. Let us seek no fresh path; we should lose ourselves in ways of ease. It
would be a strange thing to fancy we should gain these graces by any other road
than that by which Jesus and all His saints have gone before. Let us not dream
of such a thing: believe me, both Martha and Mary must entertain our Lord and
keep Him as their Guest, nor must they be so inhospitable as to offer Him no
food. How can Mary do this <pb n="294" id="xi.iv-Page_294"/>while
she sits at His feet, if her sister does not help her?<note n="449" id="xi.iv-p19.1">St. <scripRef passage="Luke x. 39, 40" id="xi.iv-p19.2" parsed="|Luke|10|39|10|40" osisRef="Bible:Luke.10.39-Luke.10.40">Luke x. 39, 40</scripRef>. <i>Life</i>, ch. xvii. 6. <i>Rel</i>. viii. 6. <i>Way of Perf</i>.
ch. xxxi. 4. <i>Concep</i>. ch. vii. 4.</note></p>

<p id="xi.iv-p20">18.
His food is that in every possible way we should draw souls to Him so that they
may be saved and may praise Him for ever. You may offer two objections&#8212;first,
that I said that Mary had chosen the better part,<note n="450" id="xi.iv-p20.1"><i>Ibid</i>. x. 42: &#8216;Maria optimam partem elegit.&#8217;</note>&#160; for she had already done Martha&#8217;s work by
waiting on our Lord, by washing His feet and by wiping them with her hair.</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p21">19.
Do you think it was a small mortification for a woman of rank, as she was, to
go through the street, perhaps by herself, for in her zeal she never thought of
how she went? Then she entered a house where she was a stranger and had to bear
the railing of the Pharisee and many other trials.<note n="451" id="xi.iv-p21.1"><i>Ibid</i>. vii. 37.</note>&#160; It was strange to see such a woman as she had
been thus publicly change her life. With a wicked nation like the Jews, the
sight of her love for our Lord Whom they hated so bitterly was enough to make
them cast in her face her former life and taunt her with wanting to become a
saint. Doubtless she must have changed her rich robes and all the rest.
Considering how men talk now of people far less known than she was, what must
have been said of her?</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p22">20.
I assure you, sisters, she won the better part after many crosses and
mortifications. Must not the mere sight of men&#8217;s hatred of her Master have been
an intolerable trial? Then, think of what she <pb n="295" id="xi.iv-Page_295"/>endured
afterwards at our Lord&#8217;s death! I believe, myself, that she did not suffer
martyrdom because she was already a martyr by grief at witnessing the
crucifixion.<note n="452" id="xi.iv-p22.1">Marginal
note in the Saint&#8217;s handwriting.</note>&#160; Then what terrible pain His absence must have
caused her<note n="453" id="xi.iv-p22.2">Life,
ch. xxi. 9.</note>&#160; during the long years afterwards! You see,
she was not always enjoying contemplation at the feet of our Saviour!</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p23">21.
Secondly, you may say that you have neither the power nor the means to lead
souls to God; though you would willingly do so, you do not know how, as you can
neither teach nor preach as did the Apostles. I have often written an answer to
this objection though I cannot tell whether I have done so in connection with
the Castle. However, as the difficulty probably often crosses your minds on
account of the desires our Lord gives you of serving Him, I will now speak of
it again.<note n="454" id="xi.iv-p23.1"><i>Way of Perf</i>. ch, i. 1. <i>Found</i>, ch. i, 6, 7. <i>Supra</i>, M. vi ch. vi, 2.</note>&#160; I told you elsewhere how the devil frequently
fills our thoughts with great schemes, so that instead of putting our hands to
what work we can do to serve our Lord, we may rest satisfied with wishing to
perform impossibilities.</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p24">22.
You can do much by prayer; and then, do not try to help the whole world, but
principally your companions; this work will be all the better because you are
the more bound to it. Do you think it is a trifling matter that your humility
and mortification, your readiness to serve your sisters, your fervent charity
towards them, and your love of God, should be as a fire to enkindle their zeal, <pb n="296" id="xi.iv-Page_296"/>and
that you should constantly incite them to practise the other virtues? This
would be a great work and one most pleasing to our Lord: by thus doing all that
is in your power, you would prove to His Majesty your willingness to do still
more and He would reward you as if you had won Him many souls. Do you answer:
&#8217;This would not be converting my sisters, for they are very good already?&#8217; What
business is that of yours? If they were still better, the praise they render
God would please Him more and their prayers would be more helpful to their
neighbours.<note n="455" id="xi.iv-p24.1"><i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. vii. 7.</note></p>

<p id="xi.iv-p25">23.
In short, my sisters, I will conclude with this advice; do not build towers
without a foundation, for our Lord does not care so much for the importance of
our works as for the love with which they are done. When we do all we can, His
Majesty will enable us to do more every day. If we do not grow weary, but
during the brief time this life lasts (and perhaps it will be shorter than any
of you think) we give our Lord every sacrifice we can, both interior and
exterior, His Majesty will unite them with that He offered to His Father for us
on the Cross so that they may be worth the value given them by our love,
however mean the works themselves may be.</p>

<p id="xi.iv-p26">24.
May it please His Majesty, my sisters and my daughters, that we may all meet
together where we may praise Him for ever, and may He give me grace to practice
something of what I have taught you, by the merits of His Son, Who liveth and <pb n="297" id="xi.iv-Page_297"/>reigneth
for ever! Amen. I assure you that I am filled with confusion at myself and I
beg you, for the sake of the same Lord, not to forget this poor sinner in your
prayers.</p>

<p class="First" id="xii-p1">ALTHOUGH,
as I told you, I felt reluctant to begin this work, yet now it is finished I am
very glad to have written it, and I think my trouble has been well spent,
though I confess it has cost me but little. Considering your strict enclosure,
the little recreation you have, my sisters, and how many conveniences are
wanting in some of your convents, I think it may console you to enjoy
yourselves in this interior castle which you can enter, and walk about at will,
at any hour you please, without asking leave of your superiors. It is true you
cannot enter all the mansions by your own power, however great it may appear to
you, unless the Lord of the castle Himself admits you. Therefore I advise you
to use no violence if you meet with any obstacle, for that would displease Him
so much that He would never give you admission to them. He dearly loves
humility:<note n="456" id="xii-p1.1"><i>Way of Perf</i>. ch. xvi. 1.</note>&#160; if you think yourselves unworthy to enter the
third mansion, He will grant you all the sooner the favour of entering the
fifth. Then, if you serve Him well there and often repair to it, He will draw
you into the mansion where He dwells Himself, whence you need never depart
unless called away by the Prioress, whose <pb n="299" id="xii-Page_299"/>commands
this sovereign Master wishes you to obey as if they were His own. If by her
orders, you are often absent from His presence chamber, whenever you return He
will hold the door open for you. When once you have learnt how to enjoy this
castle, you will always find rest, however painful your trials may be, in the
hope of returning to your Lord, which no one can prevent. Although I have only
mentioned seven mansions, yet each one contains many more rooms, above, below,
and around it, with fair gardens, fountains, and labyrinths, besides other
things so delightful that you will wish to consume yourself in praising in
return the great God Who has created the soul to His own image and likeness. If
you find anything in the plan of this treatise which helps you to know Him
better, be certain that it is sent by His Majesty to encourage you, and that
whatever you find amiss in it is my own. In return for my strong desire to aid
you in serving Him, my God and my Lord, I implore you, whenever you read this,
to praise His Majesty fervently in my name and to beg Him to prosper His
Church, to give light to the Lutherans, to pardon my sins and to free me from
purgatory, where perhaps I shall be, by the mercy of God, when you see this
book (if it is given to you after having been examined by theologians). If
these writings contain any error, it is through my ignorance; I submit in all
things to the teachings of the holy Catholic Roman Church, of which I am now a
member, as I protest and promise I will be both in life and death. May our Lord
God be for ever praised and blessed! Amen, Amen.</p><pb n="300" id="xii-Page_300"/>
