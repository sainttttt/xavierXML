  <description>With over twenty volumes, the <i>Nicene and 
Post-Nicene Fathers</i> is a momentous achievement. Originally gathered 
by 
Philip Schaff, the <i>Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers</i> is a collection 
of 
writings by classical and medieval Christian theologians. The purpose of 
such a collection is to make their writings readily available. The 
entire work is divided into two series. The first series focuses on two 
classical Christian theologians--St. Augustine and St. John Chrysostom. 
St. Augustine is one of the most influential and important Christian 
thinkers of all time. In addition to reprinting his most popular two 
works--the <i>Confessions</i> and the <i>City of God</i>--these volumes 
also 
contain 
other noteworthy and important works of St. Augustine, such as <i>On the 
Holy Trinity</i>, <i>Christian Doctrine</i>, and others. St. John 
Chrysostom 
was 
an 
eloquent speaker and well-loved Christian clergyman. St. John took a 
more literal interpretation of Scripture, and much of his work focused 
on practical aspects of Christianity, particularly what is now called 
social justice. He advocated for the poor, and challenged abuses of 
authority. This particular volume contains Augustine's <i>On 
the Holy Trinity</i> and treatises on 
morality and doctrine. The <i>Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers</i> is 
comprehensive in scope, and provide keen translations of instructive and 
illuminating texts from some of the greatest theologians of the 
Christian church. These spiritually enlightening texts have aided 
Christians for over a thousand years, and remain instructive and 
fruitful even today!<br/><br/>Tim Perrine<br/>CCEL Staff Writer

<p class="c10" id="ii-p3"><span class="c9" id="ii-p3.1">This</span> third
volume contains the most important doctrinal and moral treatises of
St. Augustin, and presents a pretty complete view of his dogmatics
and ethics.</p>

<p class="c10" id="ii-p4">The most weighty of the doctrinal
treatises is that on the <i>Holy Trinity</i>. The Latin original
<i>(De Trinitate contra Arianos libri quindecim)</i> is contained
in the 8th volume of the Benedictine edition. It is the most
elaborate, and probably also the ablest and profoundest patristic
discussion of this central doctrine of the Christian religion,
unless we except the <i>Orations against the Arians</i>, by
Athanasius, &#8220;the Father of Orthodoxy,&#8221; who devoted his life to
the defense of the Divinity of Christ. Augustin, owing to his
defective knowledge of Greek, wrote his work independently of the
previous treatises of the Eastern Church on that subject. He
bestowed more time and care upon it than on any other book, except
the <i>City of God</i>.</p>

<p class="c10" id="ii-p5">The value of the present
translation, which first appeared in Mr. Clark&#8217;s edition, 1873,
has been much increased by the revision, the introductory essay,
and the critical notes of a distinguished American divine, who is
in full sympathy with St. Augustin, and thoroughly at home in the
history of this dogma. I could not have intrusted it to abler hands
than those of my friend and colleague, Dr. Shedd.</p>

<p class="c10" id="ii-p6">The moral treatises (contained in
the 6th volume of the Benedictine edition) were first translated
for the Oxford Library of the Fathers (1847). They contain much
that will instruct and interest the reader; while some views will
appear strange to those who fail to distinguish between different
ages and different types of virtue and piety. Augustin shared with
the Greek and Latin fathers the ascetic preference for voluntary
celibacy and poverty. He accepted the distinction which dates from
the second century, between two kinds of morality: a lower morality
of the common people, which consists in keeping the ten
commandments; and a higher sanctity of the elect few, which
observes, in addition, the evangelical counsels, so called, or the
monastic virtues. He practiced this doctrine after his conversion.
He ought to have married the mother of his son; but in devoting
himself to the priesthood, he felt it his duty to remain unmarried,
according to the prevailing spirit of the church in his age. His
teacher, Ambrose, and his older contemporary, Jerome, went still
further in the enthusiastic praise of single life. We must admire
their power of self-denial and undivided consecration, though we
may dissent from their theory.<note place="end" n="1" id="ii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="ii-p7">
On the ascetic tendencies of the second and third
centuries, and the gradual introduction of clerical celibacy (which
began with a decree of Bishop Siricius of Rome, 385), see Schaff,
<i>Church Hist</i>., vol. ii. 367&#8211;414, and vol. iii.
242&#8211;250.</p></note></p><pb n="iv" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_iv.html" id="ii-Page_iv"/>

<p class="c10" id="ii-p8">The asceticism of the early church was a reaction
against the awful sexual corruption of surrounding heathenism, and
with all its excesses it accomplished a great deal of good. It
prepared the way for Christian family life. The fathers appealed to
the example of Christ, who in this respect, as the Son of God,
stood above ordinary human relations, and the advice of St. Paul,
which was given in view of &#8220;the present distress,&#8221; in times of
persecution. They deemed single life better adapted to the
undivided service of Christ and his church than the married state
with its unavoidable secular cares (<scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 25" id="ii-p8.2" parsed="|1Cor|7|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.25">1 Cor. vii. 25</scripRef> sqq.).
Augustin expresses this view when he says, on <i>Virginity</i>, &#167;
27:</p>

<p class="c10" id="ii-p9">&#8220;Therefore go on, Saints of God,
boys and girls, males and females, unmarried men and women; go on
and persevere unto the end. Praise more sweetly the Lord, whom ye
think on more richly; hope more happily in Him, whom ye serve more
earnestly; love more ardently Him, whom ye please more attentively.
With loins girded, and lamps burning, wait for the Lord, when He
returns from the marriage. Ye shall bring unto the marriage of the
Lamb a new song, which ye shall sing on your harps.&#8221;</p>

<p class="c10" id="ii-p10">The Reformation has abolished the
system of monasticism and clerical celibacy, and substituted for
it, as the normal condition for the clergy as well as the laity,
the purity, chastity and beauty of family life, instituted by God
in Paradise and sanctioned by our Saviour&#8217;s presence at the
wedding at Cana.</p>

<p class="c26" id="iv.i.i-p2">By William G. T. Shedd,
D.D.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p3"><span class="c9" id="iv.i.i-p3.1">The</span> 
doctrine of the Divine Unity is a truth of natural religion; the
doctrine of the Trinity is a truth of revealed religion. The
various systems of natural theism present arguments for the Divine
existence, unity, and attributes, but proceed no further. They do
not assert and endeavor to demonstrate that the Supreme Being is
three persons in one essence. It is because this doctrine is not
discoverable by human reason, that the Christian church has been
somewhat shy of attempts to construct it analytically; or even to
defend it upon grounds of reason. The keen Dr. South expresses the
common sentiment, when he remarks that &#8220;as he that denies this
fundamental article of the Christian religion may lose his soul, so
he that much strives to understand it may lose his wits.&#8221; Yet all
the truths of revelation, like those of natural religion, have in
them the element of reason, and are capable of a rational defense.
At the very least their self-consistence can be shown, and
objections to them can be answered. And this is a rational process.
For one of the surest characteristics of reason is, freedom from
self contradiction, and consonance with acknowledged truths in
other provinces of human inquiry and belief.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p4">It is a remarkable fact, that the
earlier forms of Trinitarianism are among the most metaphysical and
speculative of any in dogmatic history. The controversy with the
Arian and the Semi-Arian, brought out a statement and defense of
the truth, not only upon scriptural but ontological grounds. Such a
powerful dialectician as Athanasius, while thoroughly and intensely
scriptural&#8212;while starting from the text of scripture, and
subjecting it to a rigorous exegesis&#8212;did not hesitate to pursue
the Arian and Semi-Arian dialectics to its most recondite fallacy
in its subtlest recesses. If any one doubts this, let him read the
four Orations of Athanasius, and his defence of the Nicene Decrees.
In some sections of Christendom, it has been contended that the
doctrine of the Trinity should be received without any attempt at
all to establish its rationality and intrinsic necessity. In this
case, the tenets of eternal generation and procession have been
regarded as going beyond the Scripture data, and if not positively
rejected, have been thought to hinder rather than assist faith in
three divine persons and one God. But the history of opinions shows
that such sections of the church have not proved to be the
strongest defenders of the Scripture statement, nor the most
successful in keeping clear of the Sabellian, Arian, or even
Socinian departure from it.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p5">Those churches which have followed
Scripture most implicitly, and have most feared human speculation,
are the very churches which have inserted into their creeds the
most highly analytic statement that has yet been made of the
doctrine of the Trinity. The Nicene Trinitarianism is incorporated
into nearly all the symbols of modern Christendom; and this
specifies, particularly, the tenets of eternal generation and
procession with their corollaries. The English Church, to whose
great divines, Hooker, Bull, Waterland, and Pearson, scientific
Trinitarianism owes a very lucid and careful statement, has added
the Athanasian creed to the Nicene. The Presbyterian churches,
distinguished for the closeness of their adherence to the simple
Scripture, yet call upon their membership to confess, <pb n="4" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_4.html" id="iv.i.i-Page_4"/>that &#8220;in the
unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance,
power, and eternity; God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy
Ghost. The Father is of none, neither begotten nor proceeding; the
Son is eternally begotten of the Father; the Holy Ghost eternally
proceeding from the Father and the Son.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2" id="iv.i.i-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.i-p6">
Westminster Confession, II. iii.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p7">The treatise of Augustin upon the
Trinity, which is here made accessible to the English reader, is
one of the ablest produced in the patristic age. The author devoted
nearly thirty years of his matured life to its composition (<span class="c19" id="iv.i.i-p7.1">A.D.</span> 400 to 428). He was continually touching
and retouching it, and would have delayed its publication longer
than he did, had a copy not been obtained surreptitiously and
published. He seems to have derived little assistance from others;
for although the great Greek Trinitarians&#8212;Athanasius, the two
Gregories, and Basil&#8212;had published their treatises, yet he
informs us that his knowledge of Greek, though sufficient for
understanding the exegetical and practical writings of his brethren
of the Greek Church, was not adequate to the best use of their
dialectical and metaphysical compositions.<note place="end" n="3" id="iv.i.i-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.i-p8">
That Augustin had considerable acquaintance with
Greek is proved by his many references and citations throughout his
writings. In this work, see XII. vii. 11; XII. xiv. 22; XIII. x.
14; XIV. i. 1; XV. ix. 15. His statement in III. i. 1, is, that he
was &#8220;not <i>so</i> familiar with the Greek tongue (<i>Gr&#230;c&#230;
lingu&#230; non sit nobis tantus habitus</i>), as to be able to read
and understand the books that treat of such [metaphysical]
topics.&#8221; In V. viii. 10, he remarks that he does not comprehend
the distinction which the Greek Trinitarians make between
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.i-p8.1">&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#8055;&#945; 
and &#8017;&#960;&#8057;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>; which shows that he
had not read the work of Gregory of Nyssa, in which it is defined
with great clearness. One may have a good knowledge of a language
for general purposes, and yet be unfamiliar with its philosophical
nomenclature.</p></note> Accordingly, there is no trace in
this work of the writings of the Greek Trinitarians, though a
substantial agreement with them. The only Trinitarian author to
whom he alludes is Hilary&#8212;a highly acute and abstruse
Trinitarian.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p9">In his general position, Augustin
agrees with the Nicene creed; but laying more emphasis upon the
consubstantiality of the persons, and definitely asserting the
procession of the Spirit from the Father and Son. Some dogmatic
historians seem to imply that he differed materially from the
Nicene doctrine on the point of <i>subordination</i>. Hagenbach
(Smith&#8217;s Ed. &#167; 95) asserts that &#8220;Augustin completely purified
the dogma of the Trinity from the older vestiges of
subordination;&#8221; and adds that &#8220;such vestiges are unquestionably
to be found in the most orthodox Fathers, not only in the East but
also in the West.&#8221; He cites Hilary and Athanasius as examples,
and quotes the remark of Gieseler, that &#8220;the idea of a
subordination lies at the basis of such declarations.&#8221; Neander
(II. 470, Note 2) says that Augustin &#8220;kept at a distance
everything that bordered on subordinationism.&#8221; These statements
are certainly too sweeping and unqualified. There are three kinds
of subordination: the filial or trinitarian; the theanthropic; and
the Arian. The first is taught, and the second implied, in the
Nicene creed. The last is denied and excluded. Accordingly,
dogmatic historians like Petavius, Bull, Waterland, and Pearson,
contend that the Nicene creed, in affirming the filial, but denying
the Arian subordination; in teaching subordination as to person and
relationship, but denying it as to essence; enunciates a revealed
truth, and that this is endorsed by all the Trinitarian fathers,
Eastern and Western. And there certainly can be no doubt that
Augustin held this view. He maintains, over and over again, that
Sonship as a relationship is second and subordinate to Fatherhood;
that while a Divine Father and a Divine Son must necessarily be of
the very same nature and grade of being, like a human father and a
human son, yet the latter issues from the former, not the former
from the latter. Augustin&#8217;s phraseology on this point is as
positive as that of Athanasius, and in some respects even more bold
and capable of misinterpretation. He denominates the Father the
&#8220;beginning&#8221; (principium) of the Son, and the Father and Son the
&#8220;beginning&#8221; (principium) of the Holy Spirit. &#8220;The Father is
the beginning of the whole divinity, or if it is better so
expressed, deity.&#8221; IV. xx. 29. &#8220;In their mutual
rela<pb n="5" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_5.html" id="iv.i.i-Page_5"/>tion to one another in the Trinity itself, if the
begetter is a beginning (principium) in relation to that which he
begets, the Father is a beginning in relation to the Son, because
he begets Him.&#8221; V. xiv. 15. Since the Holy Spirit proceeds from
both Father and Son, &#8220;the Father and Son are a beginning
(principium) of the Holy Spirit, not two beginnings.&#8221; V. xiv. 15.
Compare also V. xiii.; X. iv.; and annotations pp. Augustin employs
this term &#8220;beginning&#8221; only in relation to the person, not to
the essence. There is no &#8220;beginning,&#8221; or source, when the
essence itself is spoken of. Consequently, the &#8220;subordination&#8221;
(implied in a &#8220;beginning&#8221; by generation and spiration) is not
the Arian subordination, as to essence, but the trinitarian
subordination, as to person and relation.<note place="end" n="4" id="iv.i.i-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.i-p10">
For an analysis of Augustin&#8217;s Trinitarianism,
see Bauv: <i><span lang="DE" id="iv.i.i-p10.1">

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p11">Augustin starts with the assumption
that man was made in the image of the <i>triune</i> God, the God of
revelation; not in the image of the God of natural religion, or the
untriune deity of the nations. Consequently, it is to be expected
that a trinitarian analogue can be found in his mental
constitution. If man is God&#8217;s image, he will show traces of it in
every respect. All acknowledge that the Divine unity, and all the
communicable attributes, have their finite correspondents in the
unity and attributes of the human mind. But the Latin father goes
further than this. This, in his view, is not the whole of the
Divine image. When God says, &#8220;Let <i>us</i> make man in <i>
our</i> image, after <i>our</i> likeness&#8221; (<scripRef passage="Gen. i. 26" id="iv.i.i-p11.2" parsed="|Gen|1|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.26">Gen. i. 26</scripRef>), Augustin
understands these words to be spoken <i>by</i> the Trinity, and <i>
of</i> the Trinity&#8212;by and of the true God, the God of revelation:
the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, one God. He denies that this is
merely the <i>pluralis excellenti&#230;</i>, and that the meaning of
these words would be expressed by a change of the plural to the
singular, and to the reading, &#8220;Let <i>me</i> make man in <i>
my</i> image, after <i>my</i> likeness.&#8221; &#8220;For if the Father
alone had made man without the Son, it would not have been written,
&#8216;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.&#8217;&#8221; City of
God XVI. vi.; Trinity I. vii. 14. In Augustin&#8217;s opinion, the Old
Testament declaration that God is a unity, does not exclude the New
Testament declaration that he is a trinity. &#8220;For&#8221; says he,
&#8220;that which is written, &#8216;Hear O Israel: the Lord our God is one
Lord&#8217; ought certainly not to be understood as if the Son were
excepted, or the Holy Spirit were excepted; which one Lord our God
we rightly call our Father, as regenerating us by his grace.&#8221;
Trinity V. xi. 12. How far Moses <i>understood</i> the full meaning
of the Divine communication and instruction, is one thing. <i>
Who</i> it really and actually was that made the communication to
him, is another. Even if we assume, though with insufficient reason
for so doing, that Moses himself had no intimation of the Trinity,
it does not follow that it was not the Trinity that inspired him,
and all the Hebrew prophets. The apostle Peter teaches that the Old
Testament inspiration was a Trinitarian inspiration, when he says
that &#8220;the prophets who prophesied of the grace that should come,
searched what the Spirit of <i>Christ</i> which was in them did
signify, when it testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ,
and the glory that should follow.&#8221; (<scripRef passage="1 Pet. i. 10, 11" id="iv.i.i-p11.4" parsed="|1Pet|1|10|1|11" osisRef="Bible:1Pet.1.10-1Pet.1.11">1 Pet. i. 10, 11</scripRef>).</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p12">In asserting, however, that an
image of the Trinity exists in man&#8217;s nature, Augustin is careful
to observe that it is utterly imperfect and inadequate. He has no
thought or expectation of clearing up the mystery by any analogy
whatever. He often gives expression to his sense of the
inscrutability and incomprehensibility of the Supreme Being, in
language of the most lowly and awe-struck adoration. &#8220;I pray to
our Lord God himself, of whom we ought always to think, and yet of
whom we are not able to think worthily, and whom no speech is
sufficient to declare, that He will grant me both help for
understanding and explaining that which I design, and pardon if in
anything I offend.&#8221; V. i. 1. &#8220;O Lord the one God, God the
Trinity, whatever I have said in these books that is of Thine, may
they acknowledge who are Thine; if anything of my own, may it be
pardoned both by Thee and by those who are Thine. Amen.&#8221; XV.
xxviii.</p><pb n="6" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_6.html" id="iv.i.i-Page_6"/>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p13">Augustin&#8217;s method in this work is (1.) The exegetical;
(2.) The rational. He first deduces the doctrine of the Trinity
from Scripture, by a careful collation and combination of the
texts, and then defends it against objections, and illustrates it
by the analogies which he finds in nature generally, and in the
human mind particularly. The Scripture argument is contained in the
first seven books; the rational in the last eight. The first part
is, of course, the most valuable of the two. Though the reader may
not be able to agree with Augustin in his interpretation of some
Scripture passages, particularly some which he cites from the Old
Testament, he will certainly be impressed by the depth, acumen, and
accuracy with which the Latin father reaches and exhausts the
meaning of the acknowledged trinitarian texts. Augustin lived in an
age when the Scriptures and the Greek and Roman classics were
nearly all that the student had, upon which to expend his
intellectual force. There was considerable metaphysics, it is true,
but no physics, and little mathematics. There was consequently a
more undivided and exclusive attention bestowed upon revealed
religion as embodied in the Scriptures, and upon ethics and natural
religion as contained in the classics, than has ever been bestowed
by any subsequent period in Christendom. One result was that
scripture was expounded by scripture; things spiritual by things
spiritual. This appears in the exegetical part of this treatise.
Augustin reasons out of the Scriptures; not out of metaphysics or
physics.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p14">The second, or speculative division
of the work, is that which will be most foreign to the thinking of
some trinitarians. In it they will find what seems to them to be a
philosophy, rather than an interpretation of the word of God. We
shall, therefore, in this introductory essay, specify some of the
advantages, as it seems to us, of the general method of defending
and illustrating the doctrine of the Trinity employed by Augustin
and the patristic Trinitarians.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p15">1. Fuller justice is done to
Scripture by this method. Revelation denominates the first
trinitarian person the Father, the second the Son, the third the
Spirit. These terms are literal, not metaphorical; because the
relations denoted by them are eternally in the essence. Scripture
clearly teaches that the Father is such from eternity.
Consequently, &#8220;paternity&#8221; (implied in the name Father) can no
more be ascribed to the first person of the Godhead in a figurative
sense, than eternity can be. For a person that is a father must be
so in relation to a son. No son, no father. Consequently, an <i>
eternal</i> Father implies an eternal Son. And the same reasoning
holds true of the relation of the Father and Son to the Spirit. The
terms Father, Son, and Spirit, in the baptismal formula and the
apostolic benediction, must designate primary and eternal
distinctions. The rite that initiates into the kingdom of God,
certainly would not be administered in three names that denote only
assumed and temporal relations of God; nor would blessings for time
and eternity be invoked from God under such secondary
names.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p16">Hence, these trinal names given to
God in the baptismal formula and the apostolic benediction,
actually <i>force</i> upon the trinitarian theologian, the ideas of
paternity, generation, filiation, spiration, and procession. He
cannot reflect upon the implication of these names without forming
these ideas, and finding himself necessitated to concede their
literal validity and objective reality. He cannot say that the
first person is the Father, and then deny that he &#8220;begets.&#8221; He
cannot say that the second person is the Son, and then deny that he
is &#8220;begotten.&#8221; He cannot say that the third person is the
Spirit, and then deny that he &#8220;proceeds&#8221; by &#8220;spiration&#8221;
(<i>spiritus quia spiratus</i>) from the Father and Son. When
therefore Augustin, like the primitive fathers generally, endeavors
to illustrate this eternal, necessary, and constitutional
energizing and activity (<i>opera ad intra</i>) in the Divine
Essence, whereby the Son issues from the Father and the Spirit from
Father and Son, by the emanation of sunbeam from sun, light from

thought&#8212;when the ternaries from nature and the human mind are
introduced to elucidate the Trinity&#8212;nothing more is done than
when by other well-known and commonly adopted analogies the Divine
unity, or omniscence, or omnipresence, is sought to be illustrated.
There is no analogy taken from the finite that will clear up the
mystery of the infinite&#8212;whether it be the mystery of the eternity
of God, or that of his trinity. But, at the same time, by the use
of these analogies the mind is kept close up to the Biblical term
or statement, and is not allowed to content itself with only a
half-way understanding of it. Such a method brings thoroughness and
clearness into the interpretation of the Word of God.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p17">2. A second advantage in this
method is, that it shows the doctrine of the Trinity to be
inseparable from that of the Unity of God. The Deistical conception
of the Divine unity is wholly different from the Christian. The
former is that of natural religion, formed by the unassisted human
mind in its reflection upon the Supreme Being. The latter is that
of revealed religion, given to the human mind by inspiration. The
Deistical unity is mere singleness. The Christian unity is a
trinality. The former is a unit. The latter a true unity, and
union. The former is meagre, having few contents. The latter is a
plenitude&#8212;what St. Paul denominates &#8220;the fullness of the
Godhead&#8221; (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.i-p17.1">&#960;&#955;&#8053;&#961;&#969;&#956;&#945;
&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>).

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p18">It follows, consequently, that the
Divine unity cannot be discussed by itself without reference to
trinality, as the Deist and the Socinian endeavor to do.<note place="end" n="5" id="iv.i.i-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.i-p19">
The Mohammedan conception of the Divine Unity,
also, is deistic. In energetically rejecting the doctrine of the
Trinity, the Mohammedan is the Oriental Unitarian.</p></note> Trinality belongs as necessarily and
intrinsically to the Divine unity as eternity does to the Divine
essence. &#8220;If,&#8221; says Athanasius (Oration I. 17) &#8220;there was not
a Blessed Trinity from eternity, but only a unity existed first,
which at length became a Trinity, it follows that the Holy Trinity
must have been at one time imperfect, and at another time entire:
imperfect until the Son came to be created, as the Arians maintain,
and then entire afterwards.&#8221; If we follow the teachings of
Revelation, and adopt the revealed idea of God, we may not discuss
mere and simple unity, nor mere and simple trinality; but we must
discuss unity <i>in</i> trinality, and trinality <i>in</i> unity.
We may not think of a monad which originally, and in the order
either of nature or of time, is not trinal, but becomes so. The
instant there is a monad, there is a triad; the instant there is a
unity, there are Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Christian
Trinity is not that of Sabellius: namely, an original untrinal
monad that subsequently, in the order of nature if not of time,
becomes a triad; whereby four factors are introduced into the
problem. God is not one <i>and</i> three, but one <i>in</i> three.
There is no primary monad, as such, and without trinality, to which
the three distinctions are secondary adjuncts. The monad, or
essence, never exists in and by itself as untrinalized, as in the
Sabellian scheme. It exists only as in the three Persons; only as
trinalized. The Essence, consequently, is not prior to the Persons,
either in the order of nature or of time, nor subsequent to them,
but simultaneously and eternally in and with them.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p20">The Primitive church took this
ground with confidence. Unity and trinality were inseparable in
their view. The term God meant for them the Trinity. A
&#8220;theologian,&#8221; in their nomenclature, was a trinitarian. They
called the Apostle John <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.i-p20.1">&#8001;
&#952;&#949;&#8057;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>, because he was
enlightened by the Holy Spirit to make fuller disclosures, in the
preface to his Gospel, concerning the deity of the Logos and the
doctrine of the Trinity, than were the other evangelists. And they
gave the same epithet to Gregory Nazianzum, because of the acumen
and insight of his trinitarian treatises. This work of Augustin
adopts the same position, and defends it with an ability second to
none.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p21">3. A third advantage of this method
of illustrating the doctrine of the Trinity is, that it goes to
show that the personality of God depends upon the trinality of the
Divine Essence<pb n="8" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_8.html" id="iv.i.i-Page_8"/>&#8212;that if there are no interior
distinctions in the Infinite Being, he cannot be
self-contemplative, self-cognitive, or self-communing.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p22">This is an important and valuable
feature of the method in question, when viewed in its bearing upon
the modern assertion that an Infinite Being cannot be personal.
This treatise of Augustin does not develope the problem upon this
point, but it leads to it. In illustrating the Trinity by the
ternaries in nature, and especially in the human mind, he aims only
to show that trinality of a certain kind does not conflict with <i>
unity</i> of a certain kind. Memory, understanding, and will are
three faculties, yet one soul. Augustin is content with elucidating
the Divine unity by such illustrations. The elucidation of the
Divine <i>personality</i> by them, was not attempted in his day nor
in the Medi&#230;val and Reformation churches. The conflict with
pantheism forced this point upon the attention of the Modern
church.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p23">At the same time, these Christian
fathers who took the problem of the Trinity into the centre of the
Divine essence, and endeavored to show its necessary grounds there,
prepared the way for showing, by the same method, that trinality is
not only consistent with personality, but is actually indispensable
to it. In a brief essay like this, only the briefest hints can be
indicated.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p24">If God is personal, he is
self-conscious. Self-consciousness is, (1), the power which a
rational spirit, or mind, has of making itself its own object; and,
(2), of knowing that it has done so. If the first step is taken,
and not the second, there is no self-consciousness. For the subject
would not know that the object is the <i>self</i>. And the second
step cannot be taken, if the first has not been. These two acts of
a rational spirit, or mind, involve three distinctions in it, or
three modes of it. The whole mind as a subject contemplates the
very same whole mind as an object. Here are two distinctions, or
modes of one mind. And the very same whole mind perceives that the
contemplating subject and the contemplated object are one and the
same essence or being. Here are three modes of one mind, each
distinct from the others, yet all three going to make up the one
self-conscious spirit. Unless there were these three distinctions,
there would be no self-knowledge. Mere singleness, a mere subject
without an object, is incompatible with
self-consciousness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p25">In denying distinctions in the
Divine Essence, while asserting its personality, Deism, with
Socinianism and Mohammedanism, contends that God can be
self-knowing and self-communing as a single subject without an
object. The controversy, consequently, is as much between the deist
and the psychologist, as it is between him and the trinitarian. It
is as much a question whether his view of personality and
self-consciousness is correct, as whether his interpretation of
Scripture is. For the dispute involves the necessary conditions of
personality. If a true psychology does not require trinality in a
spiritual essence in order to its own self-contemplation, and
self-knowledge, and self-communion, then the deist is correct; but
if it does, then he is in error. That the study of
self-consciousness in modern metaphysics has favored
trinitarianism, is unquestionable. Even the spurious trinitarianism
which has grown up in the schools of the later pantheism goes to
show, that a trinal constitution is requisite in an essence, in
order to explain self-consciousness, and that absolute singleness,
or the absence of all interior distinctions, renders the problem
insoluble.<note place="end" n="6" id="iv.i.i-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.i-p26">
&#8220;That view of the divine nature which makes it
inconsistent with the Incarnation and Trinity is <i>
philosophically</i> imperfect, as well as scripturally
incorrect.&#8221; H. B. Smith: <i>Faith and Philosophy</i>, p.
191.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p27">But the authority of Scripture is
higher than that of psychology, and settles the matter. Revelation
unquestionably discloses a deity who is &#8220;blessed forever;&#8221;
whose blessedness is <i>independent</i> of the universe which he
has made from nonentity, and who must therefore find all the
conditions of blessedness within himself alone. He is blessed from
eternity, in his own self-contemplation and self-communion. He does
not need the universe in order <pb n="9" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_9.html" id="iv.i.i-Page_9"/>that he may have an object which
he can know, which he can love, and over which he can rejoice.
&#8220;The Father knoweth the Son,&#8221; from all eternity (<scripRef passage="Matt. 11.27" id="iv.i.i-p27.1" parsed="|Matt|11|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.27">Matt. xi. 27</scripRef>); and
&#8220;loveth the Son,&#8221; from all eternity (<scripRef passage="John iii. 35" id="iv.i.i-p27.3" parsed="|John|3|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.3.35">John iii. 35</scripRef>); and
&#8220;glorifieth the Son,&#8221; from all eternity (<scripRef passage="John xvii. 5" id="iv.i.i-p27.5" parsed="|John|17|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.17.5">John xvii. 5</scripRef>). Prior to
creation, the Eternal Wisdom &#8220;was by Him as one brought up with
Him, and was daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him&#8221;
(<scripRef passage="Prov. viii. 30" id="iv.i.i-p27.7" parsed="|Prov|8|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.8.30">Prov. viii. 30</scripRef>); and the
Eternal Word &#8220;was in the beginning with God&#8221; (<scripRef passage="John i. 2" id="iv.i.i-p27.9" parsed="|John|1|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.2">John i. 2</scripRef>); and &#8220;the
Only Begotten Son (or God Only Begotten, as the uncials read) was
eternally in the bosom of the Father&#8221; (<scripRef passage="John i. 18" id="iv.i.i-p27.11" parsed="|John|1|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.18">John i. 18</scripRef>).</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p28">Here is society within the Essence,
and wholly independent of the universe; and communion and
blessedness resulting therefrom. But this is impossible to an
essence without personal distinctions. Not the singular Unit of the
deist, but the plural Unity of the trinitarian, explains this. A
subject without an object could not know. What is there to be
known? Could not love. What is there to be loved? Could not
rejoice. What is there to rejoice over? And the object cannot be
the universe. The <i>infinite</i> and <i>eternal</i> object of
God&#8217;s infinite and eternal knowledge, love, and joy, cannot be
his creation: because this is neither eternal, nor infinite. There
was a time when the universe was not; and if God&#8217;s
self-consciousness and blessedness depends upon the universe, there
was a time when God was neither self-conscious nor blessed. The
objective God for the subjective God must, therefore, be very God
of very God, begotten not made, the eternal Son of the eternal
Father.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p29">The same line of reasoning applies
to the third trinitarian person, but there is no need of going
through with it. The history of opinion shows, that if the first
two eternal distinctions are conceded, there is no denial of the
reality and eternity of the third.<note place="end" n="7" id="iv.i.i-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.i-p30">

<p class="c28" id="iv.i.i-p31">The analogue derived from the
nature of finite personality and self-consciousness has one great
advantage&#8212;namely, that it illustrates the independence of the
Divine personality and self-consciousness. The later pantheism (not
the earlier of Spinoza) constructs a kind of trinity, but it is
dependent upon the universe. God distinguishes Himself from the <i>
world</i>, and thereby finds the object required for the subject.
But this implies either that the world is eternal, or else, that
God is not eternally self-conscious. The Christian trinitarianism,
on the contrary, finds all the media and conditions of
self-consciousness within the Divine Essence. God distinguishes
himself from <i>himself</i>, not from the universe. The eternal
Father beholds himself in the eternal Son, his <i>alter ego</i>,
the &#8220;express image of his own person&#8221; (<scripRef passage="Heb. i. 3" id="iv.i.i-p31.2" parsed="|Heb|1|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.1.3">Heb. i. 3</scripRef>). God does
not struggle gradually into self-consciousness, as in the Hegelian
scheme, by the help of the universe. Before that universe was in
existence, and in the solitude of his own eternity and
self-sufficiency, he had within his own essence all the media and
conditions of self-consciousness. And after the worlds were called
into being, the Divine personality remained the same immutable and
infinite self-knowledge, unaffected by anything in his
handiwork.</p>

<p class="c29" id="iv.i.i-p32">&#8220;O Light Eterne, sole in thyself

<p class="c30" id="iv.i.i-p33">Sole knowest thyself, and known

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p35">While, however, this analogue from
the conditions of finite personality approaches nearer to the
eternal distinctions in the Godhead than does that ternary which
Augustin employs&#8212;namely, memory, understanding, and will&#8212;yet
like all finite analogies to the Infinite it is inadequate. For the
subject-ego, object-ego, and ego-percipient, are not so essentially
distinct and completely objective to each other, as are the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit. They cannot employ the personal pronouns in
reference to each other. They cannot reciprocally perform acts and
discharge functions towards each other, like the <pb n="10" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_10.html" id="iv.i.i-Page_10"/>Divine Three.
Revelation is explicit upon this point. It specifies at least the
following twelve actions and relations, that incontestably prove
the conscious distinctness and mutual objectivity of the persons of
the Trinity. One divine person loves another (<scripRef passage="John iii. 35" id="iv.i.i-p35.2" parsed="|John|3|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.3.35">John iii. 35</scripRef>); dwells in

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p36">Such are some of the salient
features of this important treatise upon the Trinity. It has its
defects; but they pertain to the form more than to the matter; to
arrangement and style more than to dogma. Literary excellence is
not the forte of the patristic writers. Hardly any of them are
literary artists. Lactantius among the Latins, and Chrysostom among
the Greeks, are almost the only fathers that have rhetorical grace.
And none of them approach the beauty of the classic writers, as
seen in the harmonious flow and diction of Plato, and the exquisite
finish of Horace and Catullus.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p37">Augustin is prolix, repetitious,
and sometimes leaves his theme to discuss cognate but distantly
related subjects. This appears more in the last eight chapters,
which are speculative, than in the first seven, which are
scriptural. The material in this second division is capable of
considerable compression. The author frequently employs two
illustrations when one would suffice, and three or more when two
are enough. He discusses many themes which are not strictly
trinitarian.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p38">Yet the patient student will derive
some benefit from this discursiveness. He will find, for example,
in this treatise on the Trinity, an able examination of the subject
of miracles (Book III); of creation <i>ex nihilo</i> (III. ix); of
vicarious atonement (IV. vii-xiv); of the faculty of memory (XI.
x); and, incidentally, many other high themes are touched upon.
Before such a contemplative intellect as that of Augustin, all
truth lay spread out like the ocean, with no limits and no
separating chasms. Everything is connected and fluid. Consequently,
one doctrine inevitably leads to and merges in another, and the
eager and intense inquirer rushes forward, and outward, and upward,
and downward, in every direction. The only aim is to see all that
can be seen, and state all that can be stated. The neglect of the
form, and the anxiety after the substance, contribute to the
discursiveness. Caring little for proportion in method, and nothing
for elegance in diction, the writer, though bringing forth a vast
amount of truth, does it at the expense of clearness, conciseness,
and grace. Such is the case with the North African father&#8212;one of
the most voluminous and prolix of authors, yet one of the most
original, suggestive, and fertilizing of any.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p39">And this particular treatise is
perhaps as pregnant and suggestive as any that Augustin, or any
other theologian, ever composed. The doctrine of the Trinity is the
most <i>immense</i> of all the doctrines of religion. It is the
foundation of theology. Christianity, in the last analysis, is
Trinitarianism. Take out of the New Testament the persons of the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and there is no God left.
Take out of the Christian consciousness the thoughts and affections
that relate to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and there
is no Christian consciousness left. The Trinity is the constitutive
idea of the evangelical theology, and the formative idea of the
evangelical experience. The immensity of the doctrine makes it of
necessity a mystery; but a mystery which like night enfolds in its
unfathomed depths the bright stars&#8212;points of light, compared with
which there is no light so keen and so glittering. Mysterious as it
is, the Trinity of Divine Revelation is the doctrine that holds in
it all the hope of man; for it holds within it the infinite pity of
the Incarnation and the infinite mercy of the
Redemption.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p40">And it shares its mysteriousness
with the doctrine of the Divine Eternity. It is diffi<pb n="11" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_11.html" id="iv.i.i-Page_11"/>cult to say
which is most baffling to human comprehension, the
all-comprehending, simultaneous, successionless consciousness of
the Infinite One, or his trinal personality. Yet no theist rejects
the doctrine of the Divine eternity because of its mystery. The two
doctrines are antithetic and correlative. On one of the Northern
rivers that flows through a narrow chasm whose depth no plummet has
sounded, there stand two cliffs fronting each other, shooting their
pinnacles into the blue ether, and sending their roots down to the
foundations of the earth. They have named them Trinity and
Eternity. So stand, antithetic and confronting, in the Christian
scheme, the trinity and eternity of God.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p41">The translation of this treatise is
the work of the Rev. Arthur West Haddan, Hon. Canon of Worcester,
who, according to a note of the publisher, died while it was
passing through the press. It has been compared with the original,
and a considerable number of alterations made. The treatise is
exceedingly difficult to render into English&#8212;probably the most so
of any in the author&#8217;s writings. The changes in some instances
were necessary from a misconception of the original; but more often
for the purpose of making the meaning of the translator himself
more clear. It is believed that a comparison between the original
and revised translation will show that the latter is the more
intelligible. At the same time, the reviser would not be too
confident that in every instance the exact meaning of Augustin has
been expressed, by either the translator or reviser.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p42">The annotations of the reviser upon
important points in the treatise, it is hoped, will assist the
reader in understanding Augustin&#8217;s reasoning, and also throw some
light upon the doctrine of the Trinity.</p>

In letters of <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.3">A.D.</span> 410, 414, and at the end of <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.4">A.D.</span> 415 (<i>Ad Consentium</i>, <scripRef passage="Ep. 120" id="iv.i.ii-p3.5">Ep. 120</scripRef>, and two
<i>Ad Evodium</i>, Epp. 162, 169), it is referred to as still
unfinished and unpublished. But a letter of <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.6">
A.D.</span> 412 (<i>Ad Marcellinum</i>, <scripRef passage="Ep. 143" id="iv.i.ii-p3.7">Ep. 143</scripRef>) intimates that
friends were at that time importuning him, although without
success, to complete and publish it. And the letter to Aurelius,
which was sent to that bishop with the treatise itself when
actually completed, informs us that a portion of it, while it was
still unrevised and incomplete, was in fact surreptitiously made
public,&#8212;a proceeding which the letters above cited postpone
apparently until at least after <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.8">A.D.</span> 415.
It was certainly still in hand in <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.9">A.D.</span>
416, inasmuch as in Book XIII. a quotation occurs from the 12th
Book of the <i>De Civitate Dei</i>; and another quotation in Book
XV., from the 90th lecture on St. John, indicates most probably a
date of at least a year later, <i>viz</i>. <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.10">
A.D.</span> 417. The <i>Retractations</i>, which refer to it, are
usually dated not later than <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.11">A.D.</span> 428. The
letter to Bishop Aurelius also informs us that the work was many
years in progress, and was begun in St. Augustin&#8217;s early manhood,
and finished in his old age. We may infer from this evidence that
it was written by him between <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.12">A.D.</span> 400,
when he was forty-six years old, and had been Bishop of Hippo about
four years, and <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.13">A.D.</span> 428 at the latest;
but probably it was published ten or twelve years before this date.
He writes of it, indeed, himself, as if the &#8220;<i>nonum prematur in
annum</i>&#8221; very inadequately represented the amount of deliberate
and patient thought which a subject so profound and so sacred
demanded, and which he had striven to give to it; and as if, even
at the very last, he shrank from publishing his work, and was only
driven to do so in order to remedy the mischief of its partial and
unauthorized publication.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ii-p4">His motive for writing on the
subject may be learned from the treatise itself. It was not
directed against any individual antagonist, or occasioned by any
particular controversial emergency. In fact, his labors upon it
were, he says, continually interrupted by the distraction of such
controversies. Certain ingenious and subtle theories respecting
types or resemblances of the Holy Trinity, traceable in human
nature as being the image of God, seemed to him to supply, not
indeed a logical proof, but a strong rational presumption, of the
truth of the doctrine itself; and thus to make it incumbent upon
him to expound and unfold them in order to meet rationalizing
objectors upon (so to say) their own ground. He is careful not to
deal with these analogies or images as if they either constituted a
purely argumentative proof or exhausted the full meaning of the
doctrine, upon both which assumptions such speculations have at all
times been the fruitful parent both of presumptious theorizing and
of grievous heresy. But he nevertheless employs them more
affirmatively than would perhaps have been the case. While modern
theologians would argue negatively, from the triplicity of
independent faculties,&#8212;united, nevertheless, in the unity of a
single human person,&#8212;that any presumption of reason against the
Trinity of persons in the Godhead is thereby, if not removed, at
least materially and enormously lessened, St. Augustin seems to
argue positively from analogous grounds, as though they constituted
a direct intimation of the doctrine itself. But he takes especial
pains, at the same time, to dwell upon the incapacity of human
thought to fathom the depths of the nature of God; and he carefully
prefaces his reasonings by a statement of the Scripture evidence of
the catholic doctrine as a matter of faith and not of reason, and
by an explanation of difficult texts upon the subject. One of the
most valuable portions, indeed, of the treatise is the eloquent and
profound exposition given in this part of it of the rule of
interpretation to be applied to Scripture language respecting the
person of our Lord. It should be noticed, however, that a large
proportion of St. Augustin&#8217;s scriptural exege<pb n="14" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_14.html" id="iv.i.ii-Page_14"/>sis is
founded upon a close verbal exposition of the old Latin version,
and is frequently not borne out by the original text. And the rule
followed in rendering Scripture texts in the present translation
has been, accordingly, wherever the argument in the context rests
upon the variations of the old Latin, there to translate the words
as St. Augustin gives them, while adhering otherwise to the
language of the authorized English version. The reader&#8217;s
attention may allowably be drawn to the language of Book V. c.x.,
and to its close resemblance to some of the most remarkable phrases
of the Athanasian Creed, and again to the striking passage
respecting miracles in Book III. c.v., and to that upon the nature
of God at the beginning of Book V.; the last named of which seems
to have suggested one of the profoundest passages in the
profoundest of Dr. Newman&#8217;s <i>University Sermons</i> (p. 353,
ed. 1843). It may be added, that the writings of the Greek Fathers
on the subject were, if not wholly unknown, yet unfamiliar to
Augustin, who quotes directly only the Latin work of Hilary of
Poictiers.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ii-p5">It remains to say, that the
translation here printed was made about four years since by a
friend of the writer of this preface, and that the latter&#8217;s share
in the work has been that of thoroughly revising and correcting it,
and of seeing it through the press. He is therefore answerable for
the work as now published.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ii-p9">In the <i>Retractations</i> (ii.
15) Augustin speaks of this work in the following
terms:&#8212;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ii-p10">&#8220;I spent some years in writing
fifteen books concerning the Trinity, which is God. When, however,
I had not yet finished the thirteenth Book, and some who were
exceedingly anxious to have the work were kept waiting longer than
they could bear, it was stolen from me in a less correct state than
it either could or would have been had it appeared when I intended.
And as soon as I discovered this, having other copies of it, I had
determined at first not to publish it myself, but to mention what
had happened in the matter in some other work; but at the urgent
request of brethren, whom I could not refuse, I corrected it as
much as I thought fit, and finished and published it, with the
addition, at the beginning, of a letter that I had written to the
venerable Aurelius, Bishop of Carthage, in which I set forth, in
the way of prologue, what had happened, what I had intended to do
of myself, and what love of my brethren had forced me to
do.&#8221;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ii-p11">The letter to which he here alludes
is the following:&#8212;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ii-p12">&#8220;To the most blessed Lord, whom
he reveres with most sincere love, to his holy brother and
fellow-priest, Pope Aurelius, Augustin sends health in the
Lord.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ii-p13">&#8220;I began as a very young man, and
have published in my old age, some books concerning the Trinity,
who is the supreme and true God. I had in truth laid the work
aside, upon discovering that it had been prematurely, or rather
surreptitiously, stolen from me before I had completed it, and
before I had revised and put the finishing touches to it, as had
been my intention. For I had not designed to publish the Books one
by one, but all together, inasmuch as the progress of the inquiry
led me to add the later ones to those which precede them. When,
therefore, these people had hindered the fulfillment of my purpose
(in that some of them had obtained access to the work before I
intended), I had given over dictating it, with the idea of making
my complaint public in some other work that I might write, in order
that whoso could might know that the Books had not been published
by myself, but had been taken away from my possession before they
were in my own judgment fit for publication. Compelled, however, by
the eager demands of many of my brethren, and above all by your
command, I have taken the pains, by God&#8217;s help, to complete the
work, laborious as it is; and as now corrected (not as I wished,
but as I could, lest the Books should differ very widely from those
which had surreptitiously got into people&#8217;s hands), I have sent
them to your Reverence by my very dear son and fellow-deacon, and
have allowed them to be heard, copied, and read by every one that
pleases. Doubtless, if I could have fulfilled my original
intention, although they would have contained the same sentiments,
they would have been worked out much more thoroughly and clearly,
so far as the difficulty of unfolding so profound a subject, and so
far, too, as my own powers, might have allowed. There are some
persons, however, who have the first four, or rather five, Books
without the prefaces, and the twelfth with no small part of its
later chapters omitted. But these, if they please and can, will
amend the whole, if they become acquainted with the present
edition. At any rate, I have to request that you will order this
letter to be prefixed separately, but at the beginning of the
Books. Farewell. Pray for me.&#8221;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.i-p2">1. <span class="c19" id="iv.i.iii.i-p2.1">The</span>
following dissertation concerning the Trinity, as the reader ought
to be informed, has been written in order to guard against the
sophistries of those who disdain to begin with faith, and are
deceived by a crude and perverse love of reason. Now one class of
such men endeavor to transfer to things incorporeal and spiritual
the ideas they have formed, whether through experience of the
bodily senses, or by natural human wit and diligent quickness, or
by the aid of art, from things corporeal; so as to seek to measure
and conceive of the former by the latter. Others, again, frame
whatever sentiments they may have concerning God according to the
nature or affections of the human mind; and through this error they
govern their discourse, in disputing concerning God, by distorted
and fallacious rules. While yet a third class strive indeed to
transcend the whole creation, which doubtless is changeable, in
order to raise their thought to the unchangeable substance, which
is God; but being weighed down by the burden of mortality, whilst
they both would seem to know what they do not, and cannot know what
they would, preclude themselves from entering the very path of
understanding, by an over-bold affirmation of their own
presumptuous judgments; choosing rather not to correct their own
opinion when it is perverse, than to change that which they have
once defended. And, indeed, this is the common disease of all the
three classes which I have mentioned,&#8212;<i>viz.</i>, both of those
who frame their thoughts of God according to things corporeal, and
of those who do so according to the spiritual creature, such as is
the soul; and of those who neither regard the body nor the
spiritual creature, and yet think falsely about God; and are indeed
so much the further from the truth, that nothing can be found
answering to their conceptions, either in the body, or in the made
or created spirit, or in the Creator Himself. For he who thinks,
for instance, that God is white or red, is in error; and yet these
things are found in the body. Again, he who thinks of God as now
forgetting and now remembering, or anything of the same kind, is
none the less in error; and yet these things are found in the mind.
But he who thinks that God is of such power as to have generated
Himself, is so much the <pb n="18" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_18.html" id="iv.i.iii.i-Page_18"/>more in error, because not only
does God not so exist, but neither does the spiritual nor the
bodily creature; for there is nothing whatever that generates its
own existence.<note place="end" n="8" id="iv.i.iii.i-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.i-p3">
[Augustin here puts <i>generare</i> for <i>
creare</i>&#8212;which is rarely the case with him, since the
distinction between generation and creation is of the highest
importance in discussing the doctrine of the Trinity. His thought
here is, that God does not bring himself into being, because he
always is. Some have defined God as the Self-caused: <i>causa
sui</i>. But the category of cause and effect is inapplicable to
the Infinite Being.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.i-p4">2. In order, therefore, that the
human mind might be purged from falsities of this kind, Holy
Scripture, which suits itself to babes has not avoided words drawn
from any class of things really existing, through which, as by
nourishment, our understanding might rise gradually to things
divine and transcendent. For, in speaking of God, it has both used
words taken from things corporeal, as when it says, &#8220;Hide me
under the shadow of Thy wings;&#8221;<note place="end" n="9" id="iv.i.iii.i-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.i-p5">

and it has borrowed many things from the spiritual creature,
whereby to signify that which indeed is not so, but must needs so
be said: as, for instance, &#8220;I the Lord thy God am a jealous
God;&#8221;<note place="end" n="10" id="iv.i.iii.i-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.i-p6">

whereby to frame either figures of speech or enigmatic sayings,
from things which do not exist at all. And hence it is that they
who are shut out from the truth by that third kind of error are
more mischievously and emptily vain than their fellows; in that
they surmise respecting God, what can neither be found in Himself
nor in any creature. For divine Scripture is wont to frame, as it
were, allurements for children from the things which are found in
the creature; whereby, according to their measure, and as it were
by steps, the affections of the weak may be moved to seek those
things that are above, and to leave those things that are below.
But the same Scripture rarely employs those things which are spoken
properly of God, and are not found in any creature; as, for
instance, that which was said to Moses, &#8220;I am that I am;&#8221; and,
&#8220;I Am hath sent me to you.&#8221;<note place="end" n="12" id="iv.i.iii.i-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.i-p8">

For since both body and soul also are said in some sense to <i>
be</i>, Holy Scripture certainly would not so express itself unless
it meant to be understood in some special sense of the term. So,
too, that which the Apostle says, &#8220;Who only hath
immortality.&#8221;<note place="end" n="13" id="iv.i.iii.i-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.i-p9">

also both is said to be, and is, in a certain manner immortal,
Scripture would not say &#8220;only hath,&#8221; unless because true
immortality is unchangeableness; which no creature can possess,
since it belongs to the creator alone.<note place="end" n="14" id="iv.i.iii.i-p9.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.i-p10">
[God&#8217;s being is necessary; that of the creature
is contingent. Hence the name I Am, or Jehovah,&#8212;which denotes
this difference. God alone has immortality a <i>parte ante</i>, as
well as a <i>parte post</i>.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> So also James says, &#8220;Every good
gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the
Father of Lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of
turning.&#8221;<note place="end" n="15" id="iv.i.iii.i-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.i-p11">

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.i-p13">3. Further, it is difficult to
contemplate and fully know the substance of God; who fashions
things changeable, yet without any change in Himself, and creates
things temporal, yet without any temporal movement in Himself. And
it is necessary, therefore, to purge our minds, in order to be able
to see ineffably that which is ineffable; whereto not having yet
attained, we are to be nourished by faith, and led by such ways as
are more suited to our capacity, that we may be rendered apt and
able to comprehend it. And hence the Apostle says, that &#8220;in

commended Him to us, as to babes in Christ, who, although already
born again by His grace, yet are still carnal and psychical, not by

continues, &#8220;And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in

this reason it cannot be discerned or understood by themselves,
because the eye of the human mind, being weak, is dazzled in that
so transcendent light, unless it be invigorated by the nourishment
of the righteousness of faith. First, however, we must demonstrate,
according to the authority of the Holy Scriptures, whether the
faith be so. Then, if God be willing and aid us, we may perhaps at
least so far serve these talkative arguers&#8212;more puffed up than
capable, and therefore laboring under the more dangerous
disease&#8212;as to enable them to find something which they are not
able to doubt, that so, in that case where they cannot find the
like, they may be led to lay the fault to their own minds, rather
than to the truth itself or to our reasonings; and thus, if there
be anything in them of either love or fear towards God, they may
return and begin from faith in due order: perceiving at length how
healthful a medicine has been provided for the faithful in the holy
Church, whereby a heedful piety, healing the feebleness of the
mind, may render it able to perceive the unchangeable truth, and
hinder it from falling headlong, through disorderly rashness, into
pestilent and false opinion. Neither will I myself shrink from
inquiry, if I am anywhere in doubt; nor be ashamed to learn, if I
am anywhere in error.</p>

with me; wherever, alike with myself, he hesitates, there to join
with me in inquiring; wherever he recognizes himself to be in
error, there to return to me; wherever he recognizes me to be so,
there to call me back: so that we may enter together upon the path
of charity, and advance towards Him of whom it is said, &#8220;Seek His

make this pious and safe agreement, in the presence of our Lord
God, with all who read my writings, as well in all other cases as,
above all, in the case of those which inquire into the unity of the
Trinity, of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit; because in
no other subject is error more dangerous, or inquiry more
laborious, or the discovery of truth more profitable. If, then, any
reader shall say, This is not well said, because I do not
understand it; such an one finds fault with my language, not with
my faith: and it might perhaps in very truth have been put more
clearly; yet no man ever so spoke as to be understood in all things
by all men. Let him, therefore, who finds this fault with my
discourse, see whether he can understand other men who have handled
similar subjects and questions, when he does not understand me: and
if he can, let him put down my book, or even, if he pleases, throw
it away; and let him spend labor and time rather on those whom he
understands.<note place="end" n="22" id="iv.i.iii.iii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.iii-p4">
[This request of Augustin to his reader, involves
an admirable rule for authorship generally&#8212;the desire, namely,
that truth be attained, be it through himself or through others.
Milton teaches the same, when he says that the author must &#8220;study
and love learning for itself, not for lucre, or any other end, but
the service of God and of truth, and perhaps that lasting fame and
perpetuity of praise, which God and good men have consented shall
be the reward of those whose published labors advance the good of
mankind.&#8221;&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> Yet let him
not think on that account that I ought to have been silent, because
I have not been able to express myself so smoothly and clearly to
him as those do whom he understands. For neither do all things,
which all men have written, come into the hands of all. And
possibly some, who are capable of understanding even these our
writings, may not find those more lucid works, and may meet with
ours only. And therefore it is useful that many persons should
write many books, differing in style but not in faith, concerning
even the same questions, that the matter itself may reach the
greatest number&#8212;some in one way, some in another. But if he who
complains that he has not understood these things has never been
able to comprehend any careful and exact reasonings at all upon
such subjects, let him in that case deal with himself by resolution
and study, that he may <pb n="20" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_20.html" id="iv.i.iii.iii-Page_20"/>know better; not with me by
quarrellings and wranglings, that I may hold my peace. Let him,
again, who says, when he reads my book, Certainly I understand what
is said, but it is not true, assert, if he pleases, his own
opinion, and refute mine if he is able. And if he do this with
charity and truth, and take the pains to make it known to me (if I
am still alive), I shall then receive the most abundant fruit of
this my labor. And if he cannot inform myself, most willing and
glad should I be that he should inform those whom he can. Yet, for
my part, &#8220;I meditate in the law of the Lord,&#8221;<note place="end" n="23" id="iv.i.iii.iii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.iii-p5">

such short times as I can; and I commit my meditations to writing,
lest they should escape me through forgetfulness; hoping by the

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.iii-p7">6. I expect, indeed, that some, who
are more dull of understanding, will imagine that in some parts of
my books I have held sentiments which I have not held, or have not
held those which I have. But their error, as none can be ignorant,
ought not to be attributed to me, if they have deviated into false
doctrine through following my steps without apprehending me, whilst
I am compelled to pick my way through a hard and obscure subject:
seeing that neither can any one, in any way, rightly ascribe the
numerous and various errors of heretics to the holy testimonies
themselves of the divine books; although all of them endeavor to
defend out of those same Scriptures their own false and erroneous
opinions. The law of Christ, that is, charity, admonishes me
clearly, and commands me with a sweet constraint, that when men
think that I have held in my books something false which I have not
held, and that same falsehood displeases one and pleases another, I
should prefer to be blamed by him who reprehends the falsehood,
rather than praised by him who praises it. For although I, who
never held the error, am not rightly blamed by the former, yet the
error itself is rightly censured; whilst by the latter neither am I
rightly praised, who am thought to have held that which the truth
censures, nor the sentiment itself, which the truth also censures.
Let us therefore essay the work which we have undertaken in the
name of the Lord.</p>

the divine Scriptures, both Old and New, whom I have been able to
read, who have written before me concerning the Trinity, Who is
God, have purposed to teach, according to the Scriptures, this
doctrine, that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit
intimate a divine unity of one and the same substance in an
indivisible equality;<note place="end" n="25" id="iv.i.iii.iv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.iv-p3">
[Augustin teaches the Nicene doctrine of a
numerical unity of essence in distinction from a specific unity.
The latter is that of mankind. In this case there is <i>
division</i> of substance&#8212;part after part of the specific nature
being separated and formed, by propagation, into individuals. No
human individual contains the whole specific nature. But in the
case of the numerical unity of the Trinity, there is no division of
essence. The whole divine nature is in each divine person. The
three divine persons do not constitute a species&#8212;that is, three
divine individuals made by the division and distribution of one
common divine nature&#8212;but are three modes or &#8220;forms&#8221;

and therefore that they are not three Gods, but one God: although
the Father hath begotten the Son, and so He who is the Father is
not the Son; and the Son is begotten by the Father, and so He who
is the Son is not the Father; and the Holy Spirit is neither the
Father nor the Son, but only the Spirit of the Father and of the
Son, Himself also co-equal with the Father and the Son, and
pertaining to the unity of the Trinity. Yet not that this Trinity

[The term Trinity denotes the Divine essence in
all three modes. The term Father (or Son, or Spirit) denotes the
essence in only one mode. Consequently, there is something in the
Trinity that cannot be attributed to any one of the Persons, as
such; and something in a Person that cannot be attributed to the
Trinity, as such. Trinality cannot be ascribed to the first Person;
paternity cannot be ascribed to the Trinity.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.v-p2">8. Some persons, however, find a
difficulty in this faith; when they hear that the Father is God,
and the Son God, and the Holy Spirit God, and yet that this Trinity
is not three Gods, but one God; and they ask how they are to
understand this: especially when it is said that the Trinity works
indivisibly in everything that God works, and yet that a certain
voice of the Father spoke, which is not the voice of the Son; and
that none except the Son was born in the flesh, and suffered, and
rose again, and ascended into heaven; and that none except the Holy
Spirit came in the form of a dove. They wish to understand how the
Trinity uttered that voice which was only of the Father; and how
the same Trinity created that flesh in which the Son only was born
of the Virgin; and how the very same Trinity itself wrought that
form of a dove, in which the Holy Spirit only appeared. Yet,
otherwise, the Trinity does not work indivisibly, but the Father
does some things, the Son other things, and the Holy Spirit yet
others: or else, if they do some things together, some severally,
then the Trinity is not indivisible. It is a difficulty, too, to
them, in what manner the Holy Spirit is in the Trinity, whom
neither the Father nor the Son, nor both, have begotten, although
He is the Spirit both of the Father and of the Son. Since, then,
men weary us with asking such questions, let us unfold to them, as
we are able, whatever wisdom God&#8217;s gift has bestowed upon our
weakness on this subject; neither &#8220;let us go on our way with

with matter to read, I shall profit myself also; and that, in
seeking to reply to their inquiries, I shall myself likewise find
that for which I was inquiring. Accordingly I have undertaken the

that we are to take the Word of God to be the only Son of God, of
whom it is afterwards said, &#8220;And the Word was made flesh, and
dwelt among us,&#8221; on account of that birth of His incarnation,
which was wrought in time of the Virgin. But herein is declared,
not only that He is God, but also that He is of the same substance
with the Father; because, after saying, &#8220;And the Word was God,&#8221;

and if He is a substance that was made, then all things were not
made by Him; but &#8220;all things were made by Him,&#8221; therefore He is
of one and the same substance with the Father. And so He is not
only God, but also very God. And the same John most expressly
affirms this in his epistle: &#8220;For we know that the Son of God is
come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know the true
God, and that we may be in His true Son Jesus Christ. This is the

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.vi-p6">10. Hence also it follows by
consequence, that the Apostle Paul did not say, &#8220;Who alone has
immortality,&#8221; of the Father merely; but of the One and only God,
which is the Trinity itself. For that which is itself eternal life
is not mortal according to any changeableness; and hence the Son of
God, because &#8220;He is Eternal Life,&#8221; is also Himself understood
with the Father, where it is said, &#8220;Who only hath immortality.&#8221;
For we, too, are made partakers of this eternal life, and become,
in our own measure, immortal. But the eternal life itself, of which
we are made partakers, is one thing; we ourselves, who, by
partaking of it, shall live eternally, are another. For if He had
said, &#8220;Whom in His own time the Father will show, who is the
blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
who only hath immortality;&#8221; not even so would it be necessarily
understood that the Son is excluded. For neither has the Son
separated the Father from Himself, because He Himself, speaking
elsewhere with the voice of wisdom (for He Himself is the Wisdom of
God),<note place="end" n="37" id="iv.i.iii.vi-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.vi-p7">

not necessary that the words, &#8220;Who hath immortality,&#8221; should be

unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: whom in
His own time He will show, who is the blessed and only Potentate,

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.vi-p10">11. But perhaps what follows may
interfere with this meaning; because it is said, &#8220;Whom no man
hath seen, nor can see:&#8221; although this may also be taken as

not see, who yet saw and crucified Him in the flesh; whereas His
divinity can in no wise be seen by human sight, but is seen with
that sight with which they who see are no longer men, but beyond
men. Rightly, therefore, is God Himself, the Trinity, understood to

the A.V and R.V. render. St. Paul refers to one of three
&#8220;forms&#8221; of God&#8212;namely, that particular form of Sonship, which
is peculiar to the second person of the Godhead. Had the apostle
employed the article with <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.iii.vi-p21.6">
&#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#8134;</span>, the implication would

that the Logos subsisted &#8220;in a form of the <i>Father</i>,&#8221;

else (if <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.iii.vi-p22.2">
&#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#8134;</span> be rendered with the
article) that the Logos subsisted in the &#8220;form&#8221; of the Father,
neither of which is true. But if &#8220;God,&#8221; in this place, denotes
the Divine Essence, then St. Paul teaches that the unincarnate
Logos subsisted in a particular &#8220;form&#8221; of the Essence&#8212;the

of the divine Scriptures, by free use of which, as I have said, our
predecessors exploded such sophistries or errors of the heretics,
the unity and equality of the Trinity are intimated to our faith.

the working out of our salvation, that the man Christ Jesus might

sacred books as to signify, or even most expressly declare, the
Father to be greater than the Son; men have erred through a want of
careful examination or consideration of the whole tenor of the
Scriptures, and have endeavored to transfer those things which are
said of Jesus Christ according to the flesh, to that substance of
His which was eternal before the incarnation, and is eternal. They
say, for instance, that the Son is less than the Father, because it
is written that the Lord Himself said, &#8220;My Father is greater than
I.&#8221;<note place="end" n="58" id="iv.i.iii.vii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.vii-p4">

shows that after the same sense the Son is less also than Himself;
for how was He not made less also than Himself, who &#8220;emptied<note place="end" n="59" id="iv.i.iii.vii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.vii-p5">
<i>Exinanivit</i></p></note> Himself, and took upon Him the form
of a servant?&#8221; For He did not so take the form of a servant as
that He should lose the form of God, in which He was equal to the
Father. If, then, the form of a servant was so taken that the form
of God was not lost, since both in the form of a servant and in the
form of God He Himself is the same only-begotten Son of God the
Father, in the form of God equal to the Father, in the form of a
servant the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; is
there any one who cannot perceive that He Himself in the form of
God is also greater than Himself, but yet likewise in the form of a
servant less than Himself? And not, therefore, without cause the
Scripture says both the one and the other, both that the Son is
equal to the Father, and that the Father is greater than the Son.
For there is no confusion when the former is understood as on
account of the form of God, and the latter as on account of the
form of a servant. And, in truth, this rule for clearing the
question through all the sacred Scriptures is set forth in one
chapter of an epistle of the Apostle Paul, where this distinction
is commended to us plainly enough. For he says, &#8220;Who, being in
the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but
emptied Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was
made in the likeness of men: and was found in fashion<note place="end" n="60" id="iv.i.iii.vii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.vii-p6">

contends, as some have thought, that the text, &#8220;Then shall the
Son also Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under
Him,&#8221; is so turned in order that one may believe that very
&#8220;subjection&#8221; to be a change and conversion hereafter of the
creature into the substance or essence itself of the Creator, that
is, that that which had been the substance of a creature shall
become the substance of the Creator;&#8212;such an one at any rate
admits this, of which in truth there is no possible doubt, that
this had not yet taken place, when the Lord said, &#8220;My Father is
greater than I.&#8221; For He said this not only before He ascended
into heaven, but also before He had suffered, and had risen from
the dead. But they who think that the human nature in Him is to be
changed and converted into the substance of the Godhead, and that
it was so said, &#8220;Then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto
Him that put all things under Him,&#8221;&#8212;as if to say, Then also the
Son of man Himself, and the human nature taken by the Word of God,
shall be changed into the nature of Him who put all things under
Him,&#8212;must also think that this will then take place, when, after
the day of judgment, &#8220;He shall have delivered up the kingdom to
God, even the Father.&#8221; And hence even still, according to this
opinion, the Father is greater than that form of a servant which
was taken of the Virgin. But if some affirm even further, that the
man Christ Jesus has already been changed into the substance of
God, at least they cannot deny that the human nature still
remained, when He said before His passion, &#8220;For my Father is
greater than I;&#8221; whence there is no question that it was said in
this sense, that the Father is greater than the form of a servant,
to whom in the form of God the Son is equal. Nor let any one,
hearing what the apostle says, &#8220;But when He saith all things are
put under Him, it is manifest that He is excepted which did put all
things under Him,&#8221;<note place="end" n="67" id="iv.i.iii.viii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.viii-p4">

think the words, that He hath put all things under the Son, to be
so understood of the Father, as that He should not think that the
Son Himself put all things under Himself. For this the apostle
plainly declares, when he says to the Philippians, &#8220;For our

Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile body,

the Son is indivisible. Otherwise, neither hath the Father Himself
put all things under Himself, but the Son hath put all things under
Him, who delivers the kingdom to Him, and puts down all rule and
all authority and power. For these words are spoken of the Son:
&#8220;When He shall have delivered up,&#8221; says the apostle, &#8220;the

up the kingdom to God, even the Father,&#8221; He Himself is not
excluded; because He is one God together with the Father. But that

[The common explanation is better, which regards
the &#8220;kingdom&#8221; that is to be delivered up, to be the mediatorial
commission. When Christ shall have finished his work of redeeming
men, he no longer discharges the office of a mediator. It seems
incongruous to denominate the beatific vision of God by the
redeemed, a surrender of a kingdom. In I. x. 21, Augustin says that
when the Redeemer brings the redeemed from faith to sight, &#8220;He is
said to &#8216;deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father.&#8217;

For to have the fruition of God the Trinity, after whose image we

For while Martha, her sister, was cumbered about necessary
business, which, although good and useful, yet, when rest shall
have succeeded, is to pass away, she herself was resting in the

it is so said as if the Son also would not send Him, but the Father

for them for whom it is prepared by my Father,&#8221; He meant it to be
understood that He Himself, with the Father, prepares seats of
glory for those for whom He will. But some one may say: There, when
He spoke of the Holy Spirit, He so says that He Himself will send
Him, as not to deny that the Father will send Him; and in the other
place, He so says that the Father will send Him, as not to deny
that He will do so Himself; but here He expressly says, &#8220;It is
not mine to give,&#8221; and so goes on to say that these things are
prepared by the Father. But this is the very thing which we have
already laid down to be said according to the form of a servant:
<i>viz.</i>, that we are so to understand &#8220;It is not mine to
give,&#8221; as if it were said, This is not in the power of man to
give; that so He may be understood to give it through that wherein
He is God equal to the Father. &#8220;It is not mine,&#8221; He says, &#8220;to
give;&#8221; that is, I do not give these things by human power, but
&#8220;to those for whom it is prepared by my Father;&#8221; but then take

world;&#8221; and then He adds, &#8220;He that rejecteth me, and receiveth
not my words, hath one that judgeth him.&#8221; Now here we should
understand the Father, unless He had added, &#8220;The word that I have
spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.&#8221; Well, then,
will neither the Son judge, because He says, &#8220;I will not judge
him,&#8221; nor the Father, but the word which the Son hath spoken?
Nay, <pb n="32" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_32.html" id="iv.i.iii.xii-Page_32"/>but hear what yet follows: &#8220;For I,&#8221; He says, &#8220;have
not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, He gave me a
commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak; and I know
that His commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak
therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.&#8221; If
therefore the Son judges not, but &#8220;the word which the Son hath
spoken;&#8221; and the word which the Son hath spoken therefore judges,
because the Son &#8220;hath not spoken of Himself, but the Father who
sent Him gave Him a commandment what He should say, and what He
should speak:&#8221; then the Father assuredly judges, whose word it is
which the Son hath spoken; and the same Son Himself is the very
Word of the Father. For the commandment of the Father is not one
thing, and the word of the Father another; for He hath called it
both a word and a commandment. Let us see, therefore, whether
perchance, when He says, &#8220;I have not spoken of myself,&#8221; He
meant to be understood thus,&#8212;I am not born of myself. For if He
speaks the word of the Father, then He speaks Himself,<note place="end" n="163" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p32.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p33"> <i>Seipsum
loquitur</i></p></note> because He
is Himself the Word of the Father. For ordinarily He says, &#8220;The
Father gave to me;&#8221; by which He means it to be understood that
the Father begat Him: not that He gave anything to Him, already
existing and not possessing it; but that the very meaning of, To
have given that He might have, is, To have begotten that He might
be. For it is not, as with the creature so with the Son of God
before the incarnation and before He took upon Him our flesh, the
Only-begotten by whom all things were made; that He <i>is</i> one
thing, and has another: but He <i>is</i> in such way as to <i>
be</i> what He <i>has</i>. And this is said more plainly, if any
one is fit to receive it, in that place where He says: &#8220;For as
the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to
have life in Himself.&#8221;<note place="end" n="164" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p34"> <scripRef passage="John v. 26" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p34.2" parsed="|John|5|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.26">John v. 26</scripRef></p></note> For He did not give to Him, already
existing and not having life, that He should have life in Himself;
inasmuch as, in that He <i>is</i>, He is life. Therefore &#8220;He gave
to the Son to have life in Himself&#8221; means, He begat the Son to be
unchangeable life, which is life eternal. Since, therefore, the
Word of God is the Son of God, and the Son of God is &#8220;the true
God and eternal life,&#8221;<note place="end" n="165" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p34.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p35"> <scripRef passage="1 John v. 20" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p35.2" parsed="|1John|5|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.5.20">1 John v. 20</scripRef></p></note> as John says in his Epistle; so

that very word the word of the Father and the commandment of the
Father, and that very commandment everlasting life?&#8221; &#8220;And I

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p37">27. I ask, therefore, how we are to
understand, &#8220;I will not judge him; but the Word which I have
spoken shall judge him:&#8221; which appears from what follows to be so
said, as if He would say, I will not judge; but the Word of the
Father will judge. But the Word of the Father is the Son of God
Himself. Is it to be so understood: I will not judge, but I will
judge? How can this be true, unless in this way: <i>viz</i>., I
will not judge by human power, because I am the Son of man; but I
will judge by the power of the Word, because I am the Son of God?
Or if it still seems contradictory and inconsistent to say, I will
not judge, but I will judge; what shall we say of that place where
He says, &#8220;My doctrine is not mine?&#8221; How &#8220;mine,&#8221; when &#8220;not
mine?&#8221; For He did not say, <i>This</i> doctrine is not mine, but
&#8220;<i>My</i> doctrine is not mine:&#8221; that which He called His own,
the same He called not His own. How can this be true, unless He has
called it His own in one relation; not His own, in another?
According to the form of God, His own; according to the form of a
servant, not His own. For when He says, &#8220;It is not mine, but His
that sent me,&#8221;<note place="end" n="167" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p38"> <scripRef passage="John vii. 16" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p38.2" parsed="|John|7|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.7.16">John vii. 16</scripRef></p></note> He makes us

believeth not on that which he sees, lest our hope should be in the

to human eyes, and so might cleanse our hearts by faith, to
contemplate Himself as equal to the Father? So that in turning the
attention of believers to the Father, and saying, &#8220;Believeth not
on me, but on Him that sent me,&#8221; He certainly did not mean
Himself to be separated from the Father, that is, from Him that
sent Him; but that men might so believe on Himself, as they believe
on the Father, to whom He is equal. And this He says in express
terms in another place, &#8220;Ye believe in God, believe also in

Father, by saying, &#8220;Believeth not on me, but on Him that sent
me,&#8221; from whom nevertheless He certainly did not separate
Himself; so also, when He says, &#8220;It is not mine to give, but [it
shall be given to them] for whom it is prepared by my Father,&#8221; it
is I think plain in what relation both are to be taken. For that

the human nature, but the whole divine-human person under a human

designate the difference between the divine and human natures in
the theanthropos, but between the person of the <i>un</i>-incarnate

judgeth no man.&#8221; For in respect to this, that the Father hath
begotten the Son equal to Himself, He judges with Him. Therefore it
is in respect to this that it is said, that in the judgment, not
the form of God, but the form of the Son of man will appear. Not
that He will not judge, who hath committed all judgment unto the
Son, since the Son saith of Him, &#8220;There is One that seeketh and
judgeth:&#8221; but it is so said, &#8220;The Father judgeth no man, but
hath committed all judgment unto the Son;&#8221; as if it were said, No
one will see the Father in the judgment of the quick and the dead,
but all will see the Son: because He is also the Son of man, so
that He can be seen even by the ungodly, since they too shall see
Him whom they have pierced.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p17">30. Lest, however, we may seem to
conjecture this rather than to prove it clearly, let us produce a
certain and plain sentence of the Lord Himself, by which we may
show that this was the cause why He said, &#8220;The Father judgeth no
man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son,&#8221; <i>viz</i>.
because He will appear as Judge in the form of the Son of man,
which is not the form of the Father, but of the Son; nor yet that
form of the Son in which He is equal to the Father, but that in
which He is less than the Father; in order that, in the judgment,
He may be visible both to the good and to the bad. For a little
while after He says, &#8220;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that
heareth my word, and believeth on Him that sent me, hath
everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but shall
pass<note place="end" n="184" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p18"> Transi<i>it</i> in Vulg.; and so

unto life.&#8221; Now this life eternal is that sight which does not
belong to the bad. Then follows, &#8220;Verily, verily, I say unto you,
The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice
of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.&#8221;<note place="end" n="185" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p19"> <scripRef passage="John v. 24, 25" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p19.2" parsed="|John|5|24|5|25" osisRef="Bible:John.5.24-John.5.25">John v. 24, 25</scripRef></p></note> And this is

that He is the Son of God, that is, who so receive Him, as made for

thereupon He continues, enforcing this very point, &#8220;For as the
Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have
life in Himself.&#8221; And then He comes to the sight of His own
glory, in which He shall come to judgment; which sight will be
common to the ungodly and to the just. For He goes on to say,

For inasmuch as the Son of God is equal to the Father, He does not
receive this power of executing judgment, but He has it with the
Father in secret; but He receives it, so that the good and the bad
may see Him judging, inasmuch as He is the Son of man. Since the
sight of the Son of man will be shown to the bad also: for the
sight of the form of God will not be shown except to the pure in
heart, for they shall see God; that is, to the godly only, to whose
love He promises this very thing, that He will show Himself to
them. And see, accordingly, what follows: &#8220;Marvel not at this,&#8221;
He says. Why does He forbid us to marvel, unless it be that, in
truth, every one marvels who does not understand, that therefore He
said the Father gave Him power also to execute judgment, because He
is the Son of man; whereas, it might rather have been anticipated
that He would say, since He is the Son of God? But because the
wicked are not able to see the Son of God as He is in the form of
God equal to the Father, <pb n="35" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_35.html" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-Page_35"/>but yet it is necessary that
both the just and the wicked should see the Judge of the quick and
dead, when they will be judged in His presence; &#8220;Marvel not at
this,&#8221; He says, &#8220;for the hour is coming, in the which all that
are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they
that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that
have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.&#8221;<note place="end" n="187" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p20.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p21"> <scripRef passage="John v. 22-29" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p21.2" parsed="|John|5|22|5|29" osisRef="Bible:John.5.22-John.5.29">John v. 22&#8211;29</scripRef></p></note> For this
purpose, then, it was necessary that He should therefore receive
that power, because He is the Son of man, in order that all in
rising again might see Him in the form in which He can be seen by
all, but by some to damnation, by others to life eternal. And what
is life eternal, unless that sight which is not granted to the

equality of the Trinity; and in treating of the sending of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit, and of the various appearances of God,
demonstrates that He who is sent is not therefore less than He who
sends, because the one has sent, the other has been sent; but that
the Trinity, being in all things equal, and alike in its own nature
unchangeable and invisible and omnipresent, works indivisibly in
each sending or appearance.</p>

they must, by experience, the wearisome difficulties of the task,

light unapproachable, or, indeed, from the manifold and various
modes of speech employed in the sacred writings (wherein, as it

most easily to make allowance for those who err in the
investigation of so deep a secret. But there are two things most
hard to bear with, in the case of those who are in error: hasty
assumption before the truth is made plain; and, when it has been
made plain, defence of the falsehood thus hastily assumed. From
which two faults, inimical as they are to the finding out of the

grace of His mercy, I will not be slow to search out the substance
of God, whether through His Scripture or through the creature. For
both of these are set forth for our contemplation to this end, that
He may Himself be sought, and Himself be loved, who inspired the
one, and created the other. Nor shall I be afraid of giving my
opinion, in which I shall more desire to be examined by the
upright, than fear to be carped at by the perverse. For charity,
most excellent and unassuming, gratefully accepts the dovelike eye;
but for the dog&#8217;s tooth nothing remains, save either to shun it
by the most cautious humility, or to blunt it by the most solid
truth; and far rather would I be censured by any one whatsoever,
than be praised by either the erring or the flatterer. For the
lover of truth need fear no one&#8217;s censure. For he that censures,
must needs be either enemy or friend. And if an enemy reviles, he
must be borne with: but a friend, if he errs, must be taught; if he
teaches, listened to. But if one who errs praises you, he confirms
your error; if one who flatters, he seduces you into error. &#8220;Let

not only less than the Father, but also less than the Holy Spirit;
and not only so, but less even than Himself,&#8212;not than Himself who
was, but than Himself who is; because, by taking the form of a
servant, He did not lose the form of God, as the testimonies of the
Scriptures taught us, to which we have referred in the former book:
yet there are some things in the sacred text so put as to leave it
ambiguous to which rule they are rather to be referred; whether to
that by which we understand the Son as less, in that He has taken
upon Him the creature, or to that by which we understand that the
Son is not indeed less than, but equal to the Father, but yet that
He is from Him, God of God, Light of light. For we call the Son God
<i>of</i> God; but the Father, God only; not <i>of</i> God. Whence
it is plain that the Son has another <i>of</i> whom He is, and to
whom He is Son; but that the Father has not a Son <i>of</i> whom He
is, but only to whom He is father. For every son is what he is, <i>
of</i> his father, and is son to his father; but no father is what
he is, <i>of</i> his son, but is father to his son.<note place="end" n="212" id="iv.i.iv.ii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.ii-p4"> [Augustin here brings to view both
the trinitarian and the theanthropic or mediatorial subordination.
The former is the status of Sonship. God the Son is God <i>of</i>
God. Sonship as a <i>relation</i> is subordinate to paternity. But
a son must be of the same grade of being, and of the same nature
with his father. A human son and a human father are alike and
equally <i>human</i>. And a Divine Son and a Divine father are
alike and equally <i>divine</i>. The theanthropic or mediatorial
subordination is the status of humiliation, by reason of the
incarnation. In the words of Augustin, it is &#8220;that by which we
understand the Son as less, in that he has taken upon Him the
creature.&#8221; The subordination in this case is that of voluntary
condescension, for the purpose of redeeming sinful
man.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note></p>

that He might be able to do those things, who said that the Son was
not able to do anything of Himself, except what He hath seen the
Father do. Yet who, even though he were mad, would think this? It
remains, therefore, that these texts are so expressed, because the
life of the Son is unchangeable as that of the Father is, and yet
He is of the Father; and the working of the Father and of the Son
is indivisible, and yet so to work is given to the Son from Him of
whom He Himself is, that is, from the Father; and the Son so sees
the Father, as that He is the Son in the very seeing Him. For to be
of the Father, that is, to be born of the Father, is to Him nothing
else than to see the Father; and to see Him working, is nothing
else than to work with Him: but therefore not from Himself, because
He is not from Himself. And, therefore, those things which &#8220;He
sees the Father do, these also doeth the Son likewise,&#8221; because
He is of the Father. For He neither does other things in like
manner, as a painter paints other pictures, in the same way as he
sees others to have been painted by another man; nor the same
things in a different manner, as the body expresses the same
letters, which the mind has thought; but &#8220;whatsoever things,&#8221;
saith He, &#8220;the Father doeth, these same things also doeth the Son

anything of Himself, except what He seeth the Father do. From this
rule, then, whereby the Scriptures so speak as to mean, not to set
forth one as less than another, but only to show which is of which,
some have drawn this meaning, as if the Son were said to be less.
And some among ourselves who are more unlearned and least
instructed in these things, <pb n="39" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_39.html" id="iv.i.iv.ii-Page_39"/>endeavoring to take these texts
according to the form of a servant, and so misinterpreting them,
are troubled. And to prevent this, the rule in question is to be
observed whereby the Son is not less, but it is simply intimated
that He is of the Father, in which words not His inequality but His
birth is declared.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iv.iii-p2">4. There are, then, some things in
the sacred books, as I began by saying, so put, that it is doubtful
to which they are to be referred: whether to that rule whereby the
Son is less on account of His having taken the creature; or whether
to that whereby it is intimated that although equal, yet He is of
the Father. And in my opinion, if this is in such way doubtful,
that which it really is can neither be explained nor discerned,
then such passages may without danger be understood according to
either rule, as that, for instance, &#8220;My doctrine is not mine, but
His that sent me.&#8221;<note place="end" n="219" id="iv.i.iv.iii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.iii-p3"> <scripRef passage="John vii. 16" id="iv.i.iv.iii-p3.2" parsed="|John|7|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.7.16">John vii. 16</scripRef></p></note> For this may both be taken

which He is in such way equal to the Father, that He is yet of the
Father. For according to the form of God, as the Son is not one and
His life another, but the life itself is the Son; so the Son is not
one and His doctrine another, but the doctrine itself is the Son.
And hence, as the text, &#8220;He hath given life to the Son,&#8221; is no
otherwise to be understood than, He hath begotten the Son, who is
life; so also when it is said, He hath given doctrine to the Son,
it may be rightly understood to mean, He hath begotten the Son, who
is doctrine so that, when it is said, &#8220;My doctrine is not mine,
but His who sent me,&#8221; it is so to be understood as if it were, I
am not from myself, but from Him who sent me.</p>

says, &#8220;All things that the Father hath are mine; therefore said
I, that He shall take of mine&#8221;); it remains that the Holy Spirit
be understood to have of that which is the Father&#8217;s, as the Son
also hath. And how can this be, unless according to that which we

less, because it is said of Him, &#8220;For He shall not speak of
Himself, but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak;&#8221; for
the words belong to Him as <i>proceeding</i> from the Father. But
whereas both the Son is of the Father, and the Holy Spirit proceeds
from the Father, why both are not called sons, and both not said to

if he who glorifies is greater than he whom he glorifies, let them

Spirit, is to be understood; for of the Father alone, we nowhere
read that He is sent. Now, of the Son, the apostle writes thus:

Catholic does not know that he did not wish to signify the
privation of virginity; but, according to a Hebraism, the
difference of sex? When, therefore, he says, &#8220;God sent His Son,
made of a woman,&#8221; he sufficiently shows that the Son was
&#8220;sent&#8221; in this very way, in that He was &#8220;made of a woman.&#8221;

reply, I suppose, if he has a right sense in these things, Because
the will of the Father and the Son is one, and their working
indivisible. In like manner, then, let him understand the
incarnation and nativity of the Virgin, wherein the Son is
understood as sent, to have been wrought by one and the same
operation of the Father and of the Son indivisibly; the Holy Spirit
certainly not being thence excluded, of whom it is expressly said,
&#8220;She was found with child by the Holy Ghost.&#8221; For perhaps our
meaning will be more plainly unfolded, if we ask in what manner God
sent His Son. He commanded that He should come, and He, complying
with the commandment, came. Did He then request, or did He only
suggest? But whichever of these it was, certainly it was done by a
word, and the Word of God is the Son of God Himself. Wherefore,
since the Father sent Him by a word, His being sent was the work of
both the Father and His Word; therefore the same Son was sent by
the Father and the Son, because the Son Himself is the Word of the
Father. For who would embrace so impious an opinion as to think the
Father to have uttered a word in time, in order that the eternal
Son might thereby be sent and might appear in the flesh in the
fullness of time? But assuredly it was in that Word of God itself
which was in the beginning with God and was God, namely, in the
wisdom itself of God, apart from time, at what time that wisdom
must needs appear in the flesh. Therefore, since without any
commencement of time, the Word was in the beginning, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God, it was in the Word itself
without any time, at what time the Word was to be made flesh and
dwell among us.<note place="end" n="240" id="iv.i.iv.vi-p19.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.vi-p20"> <scripRef passage="John i. 1, 2, 14" id="iv.i.iv.vi-p20.2" parsed="|John|1|1|1|2;|John|1|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.1-John.1.2 Bible:John.1.14">John i. 1, 2, 14</scripRef></p></note> And when

made in time, that the Incarnate Word might appear to men; while it
was in that Word Himself, apart from time, at what time this was to
be done; for the order of times is in the eternal wisdom of God
without time. Since, then, that the Son should appear in the flesh
was wrought by both the Father and the Son, it is fitly said that
He who appeared in that flesh was sent, and that He who did not
appear in it, sent Him; because those things which are transacted
outwardly before the bodily eyes have their existence from the
inward structure (<i>apparatu</i>) of the spiritual nature, and on
that account are fitly said to be sent. Further, that form of man
which He took is the person of the Son, not also of the Father; on
which account the invisible Father, together with the Son, who with
the Father is invisible, is said to have sent the same Son by
making Him visible. But if He became visible in such way as to
cease to be invisible with the Father, that is, if the substance of
the invisible Word were turned by a change and transition into a
visible creature, then the Son would be so understood to be sent by
the Father, that He would be found to be only sent; not also, with
the Father, sending. But since He so took the form of a servant, as
that the unchangeable form of God remained, it is clear that that
which became apparent in the Son was done by the Father and the Son
not being apparent; that is, that by the invisible Father, with the
invisible Son, the same Son Himself was sent so as to be visible.
Why, therefore, does He say, &#8220;Neither came I of myself?&#8221; This,
we may now say, is said according to the form of a servant, in the
same way as it is said, &#8220;I judge no man.&#8221;<note place="end" n="242" id="iv.i.iv.vi-p21.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.vi-p22"> <scripRef passage="John viii. 42, 15" id="iv.i.iv.vi-p22.2" parsed="|John|8|42|0|0;|John|8|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.8.42 Bible:John.8.15">John viii. 42, 15</scripRef></p></note></p>

prophetic vision was not shown to bodily eyes through bodily forms,
but in the spirit through spiritual images of bodily things. But
whosoever saw that dove and that fire, saw them with their eyes.
Although it may perhaps be disputed concerning the fire, whether it
was seen by the eyes or in the spirit, on account of the form of
the sentence. For the text does not say, They saw cloven tongues
like fire, but, &#8220;There appeared to them.&#8221; But we are not wont
to say with the same meaning, It appeared to me; as we say, I saw.
And in those spiritual visions of corporeal images the usual
expressions are, both, It appeared to me; and, I saw: but in those
things which are shown to the eyes through express corporeal forms,
the common expression is not, It appeared to me; but, I saw. There
may, therefore, be a question raised respecting that fire, how it
was seen; whether within in the spirit as it were outwardly, or
really outwardly before the eyes of the flesh. But of that dove,
which is said to have descended in a bodily form, no one ever
doubted that it was seen by the eyes. Nor, again, as we call the
Son a Rock (for it is written, &#8220;And that Rock was Christ&#8221;<note place="end" n="253" id="iv.i.iv.vii-p10.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.vii-p11"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 4" id="iv.i.iv.vii-p11.2" parsed="|1Cor|10|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.4">1 Cor. x. 4</scripRef></p></note>), can we so

inquiry, the Lord helping us, we must ask, first, whether the
Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit; or whether, sometimes the
Father, sometimes the Son, sometimes the Holy Spirit; or whether it
was without any distinction of persons, in such way as the one and
only God is spoken of, that is, that the Trinity itself appeared to
the Fathers by those forms of the creature. Next, whichever of
these alternatives shall have been found or thought true, whether
for this purpose only the creature was fashioned, wherein God, as
He judged it suitable at that time, should be shown to human sight;
or whether angels, who already existed, were so sent, as to speak
in the person of God, taking a corporeal form from the corporeal
creature, for the purpose of their ministry, as each had need; or
else, according to the power the Creator has given them, changing
and converting their own body itself, to which they are not
subject, but govern it as subject to themselves, into whatever
appearances they would that were suited and apt to their several
actions. Lastly, we shall discern that which it was our purpose to
ask, <i>viz</i>. whether the Son and the Holy Spirit were also sent
before; and, if they were so sent, what difference there is between
that sending, and the one which we read of in the Gospel; or
whether in truth neither of them were sent, except when either the
Son was made of the Virgin Mary, or the Holy Spirit appeared in a
visible form, whether in the dove or in tongues of
fire.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iv.x-p2">15. But they who will have these
texts understood only of the Father, and not of the Son or the Holy
Spirit, declare the Son to be visible, not by having taken flesh of
the Virgin, but aforetime also in Himself. For He Himself, they
say, appeared to the eyes of the Fathers. And if you say to them,
In whatever manner, then, the Son is visible in Himself, in that
manner also He is mortal in Himself; so that it plainly follows
that you would have this saying also understood only of the Father,
<i>viz</i>., &#8220;Who only hath immortality;&#8221; for if the Son is
mortal from having taken upon Him our flesh, then allow that it is
on account of this flesh that He is also visible: they reply, that
it is not on account of this flesh that they say that the Son is
mortal; but that, just as He was also before visible, so He was
also before mortal. For if they say the Son is mortal from having
taken our flesh, then it is not the Father alone without the Son
who hath immortality; because His Word also has immortality, by
which all things were made. For He did not therefore lose His
immortality, because He took mortal flesh; seeing that it could not
happen even to the human soul, that it should die with the body,
when the Lord Himself says, &#8220;Fear not them which kill the body,
but are not able to kill the soul.&#8221;<note place="end" n="266" id="iv.i.iv.x-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.x-p3"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 10.28" id="iv.i.iv.x-p3.1" parsed="|Matt|10|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.28">Matt. x. 28</scripRef></p></note> Or, forsooth, also the Holy Spirit
took flesh: concerning whom certainly they will, without doubt, be
troubled to say&#8212;if the Son is mortal on account of taking our
flesh&#8212;in what manner they understand that the Father only has
immortality without the Son and the Holy Spirit, since, indeed, the
Holy Spirit did not take our flesh; and if He has not immortality,
then the Son is not mortal on account of taking our flesh; but if
the Holy Spirit has immortality, then it is not said only of the
Father, &#8220;Who only hath immortality.&#8221; And therefore they think
they are able to prove that the Son in Himself was mortal also
before the incarnation, because changeableness itself is not
unfitly called mortality, according to which the soul also is said
to die; not because it is changed and turned into body, or into
some substance other than itself, but because, whatever in its own
selfsame substance is now after another mode than it once was, is
discovered to be mortal, in so far as it has ceased to be what it
was. Because then, say they, before the Son of God was born of the
Virgin Mary, He Himself appeared to our fathers, not in one and the
same form only, but in many forms; first in one form, then in
another; He is both visible in Himself, because His substance was
visible to mortal eyes, when He had not yet taken our flesh, and
mortal, inasmuch as He is changeable. And so also the Holy Spirit,
who appeared at one time as a dove, and another time as fire.
Whence, they say, the following texts do not belong to the Trinity,
but singularly and properly to the Father only: &#8220;Now unto the
King eternal, immortal, and invisible, the only wise God;&#8221; and,
&#8220;Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man
can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can
see.&#8221;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iv.x-p4">16. Passing by, then, these
reasoners, who are unable to know the substance even of the soul,
which is invisible, and therefore are very far indeed from knowing
that the substance of the one and only God, that is, the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit, remains ever not only invisible, but
also unchangeable, and that hence it possesses true and real
immortality; let us, who deny that God, whether the Father, or the
Son, or the Holy <pb n="45" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_45.html" id="iv.i.iv.x-Page_45"/>Spirit, ever appeared to bodily
eyes, unless through the corporeal creature made subject to His own
power; let us, I say&#8212;ready to be corrected, if we are reproved in
a fraternal and upright spirit, ready to be so, even if carped at
by an enemy, so that he speak the truth&#8212;in catholic peace and
with peaceful study inquire, whether God indiscriminately appeared
to our fathers before Christ came in the flesh, or whether it was
any one person of the Trinity, or whether severally, as it were by
turns.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p2">17. And first, in that which is
written in Genesis, <i>viz</i>., that God spake with man whom He
had formed out of the dust; if we set apart the figurative meaning,
and treat it so as to place faith in the narrative even in the
letter, it should appear that God then spake with man in the
appearance of a man. This is not indeed expressly laid down in the
book, but the general tenor of its reading sounds in this sense,
especially in that which is written, that Adam heard the voice of
the Lord God, walking in the garden in the cool of the evening, and
hid himself among the trees of the garden; and when God said,
&#8220;Adam, where art thou?&#8221;<note place="end" n="267" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 8-10" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|3|8|3|10" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.8-Gen.3.10">Gen. iii. 8&#8211;10</scripRef></p></note> replied, &#8220;I heard Thy voice, and
I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid myself from Thy
face.&#8221; For I do not see how such a walking and conversation of
God can be understood literally, except He appeared as a man. For
it can neither be said that a voice only of God was framed, when
God is said to have walked, or that He who was walking in a place
was not visible; while Adam, too, says that he hid himself from the
face of God. Who then was He? Whether the Father, or the Son, or
the Holy Spirit? Whether altogether indiscriminately did God the
Trinity Himself speak to man in the form of man? The context,
indeed, itself of the Scripture nowhere, it should seem, indicates
a change from person to person; but He seems still to speak to the
first man, who said, &#8220;Let there be light,&#8221; and, &#8220;Let there be
a firmament,&#8221; and so on through each of those days; whom we
usually take to be God the Father, making by a word whatever He
willed to make. For He made all things by His word, which Word we
know, by the right rule of faith, to be His only Son. If,
therefore, God the Father spake to the first man, and Himself was
walking in the garden in the cool of the evening, and if it was
from His face that the sinner hid himself amongst the trees of the
garden, why are we not to go on to understand that it was He also
who appeared to Abraham and to Moses, and to whom He would, and how
He would, through the changeable and visible creature, subjected to
Himself, while He Himself remains in Himself and in His own
substance, in which He is unchangeable and invisible? But,
possibly, it might be that the Scripture passed over in a hidden
way from person to person, and while it had related that the Father
said &#8220;Let there be light,&#8221; and the rest which it mentioned Him
to have done by the Word, went on to indicate the Son as speaking
to the first man; not unfolding this openly, but intimating it to
be understood by those who could understand it.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p4">18. Let him, then, who has the
strength whereby he can penetrate this secret with his mind&#8217;s
eye, so that to him it appears clearly, either that the Father also
is able, or that only the Son and Holy Spirit are able, to appear
to human eyes through a visible creature; let him, I say, proceed
to examine these things if he can, or even to express and handle
them in words; but the thing itself, so far as concerns this
testimony of Scripture, where God spake with man, is, in my
judgment, not discoverable, because it does not evidently appear
even whether Adam usually saw God with the eyes of his body;
especially as it is a great question what manner of eyes it was
that were opened when they tasted the forbidden fruit;<note place="end" n="268" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p5"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 7" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p5.2" parsed="|Gen|3|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.7">Gen. iii. 7</scripRef></p></note> for before
they had tasted, these eyes were closed. Yet I would not rashly
assert, even if that scripture implies Paradise to have been a
material place, that God could not have walked there in any way
except in some bodily form. For it might be said, that only words
were framed for the man to hear, without seeing any form. Neither,
because it is written, &#8220;Adam hid himself from the face of God,&#8221;
does it follow forthwith that he usually saw His face. For what if
he himself indeed could not see, but feared to be himself seen by
Him whose voice he had heard, and had felt His presence as he
walked? For Cain, too, said to God, &#8220;From Thy face I will hide
myself;&#8221;<note place="end" n="269" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p6"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iv. 14" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p6.2" parsed="|Gen|4|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.4.14">Gen. iv. 14</scripRef></p></note> yet we are
not therefore compelled to admit that he was wont to behold the
face of God with his bodily eyes in any visible form, although he
had heard the voice of God questioning and speaking with him of his
sin. But what <pb n="46" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_46.html" id="iv.i.iv.xi-Page_46"/>manner of speech it was that God
then uttered to the outward ears of men, especially in speaking to
the first man, it is both difficult to discover, and we have not
undertaken to say in this discourse. But if words alone and sounds
were wrought, by which to bring about some sensible presence of God
to those first men, I do not know why I should not there understand
the person of God the Father, seeing that His person is manifested
also in that voice, when Jesus appeared in glory on the mount
before the three disciples;<note place="end" n="270" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p7"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 17.5" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p7.1" parsed="|Matt|17|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.17.5">Matt. xvii. 5</scripRef></p></note> and in that when the dove descended

voice could be wrought without the work of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit (since the Trinity works indivisibly), but that such a voice
was wrought as to manifest the person of the Father only; just as
the Trinity wrought that human form from the Virgin Mary, yet it is
the person of the Son alone; for the invisible Trinity wrought the
visible person of the Son alone. Neither does anything forbid us,
not only to understand those words spoken to Adam as spoken by the
Trinity, but also to take them as manifesting the person of that
Trinity. For we are compelled to understand of the Father only,
that which is said, &#8220;This is my beloved Son.&#8221;<note place="end" n="273" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p9.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p10"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 3.17" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p10.1" parsed="|Matt|3|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.17">Matt. iii. 17</scripRef></p></note> For Jesus can neither be believed
nor understood to be the Son of the Holy Spirit, or even His own
Son. And where the voice uttered, &#8220;I have both glorified, and
will glorify again,&#8221; we confess it was only the person of the
Father; since it is the answer to that word of the Lord, in which
He had said, &#8220;Father, glorify thy Son,&#8221; which He could not say
except to God the Father only, and not also to the Holy Spirit,
whose Son He was not. But here, where it is written, &#8220;And the
Lord God said to Adam,&#8221; no reason can be given why the Trinity
itself should not be understood.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p11">19. Likewise, also, in that which
is written, &#8220;Now the Lord had said unto Abraham, Get thee out of
thy country, and from thy kindred, and thy father&#8217;s house,&#8221; it
is not clear whether a voice alone came to the ears of Abraham, or
whether anything also appeared to his eyes. But a little while
after, it is somewhat more clearly said, &#8220;And the Lord appeared
unto Abraham, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land.&#8221;<note place="end" n="274" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p12"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xii. 1, 7" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p12.2" parsed="|Gen|12|1|0|0;|Gen|12|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.12.1 Bible:Gen.12.7">Gen. xii. 1, 7</scripRef></p></note> But neither
there is it expressly said in what form God appeared to him, or
whether the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit appeared to him.
Unless, perhaps, they think that it was the Son who appeared to

Lord appeared to him.&#8221; For the Son seems to be called the Lord as
though the name was appropriated to Him; as <i>e.g.</i> the apostle
says, &#8220;For though there be that are called gods, whether in
heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many and lords many,) but to
us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we

the oak at Mamre he saw three men, whom he invited, and hospitably

in due order after what manner the Lord appeared to him, it has
added the account of the three men, whom Abraham invites to his
hospitality in the plural number, and afterwards speaks to them in
the singular number as one; and as one He promises him a son by
Sara, <i>viz</i>. the one whom the Scripture calls Lord, as in the

neither a slight nor a passing consideration. For if one man had
appeared, what else would those at once cry out, who say that the
Son was visible also in His own substance before He was born of the
Virgin, but that it was Himself? since it is said, they say, of the
Father, &#8220;To the only invisible God.&#8221;<note place="end" n="281" id="iv.i.iv.xii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xii-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. i. 17" id="iv.i.iv.xii-p3.2" parsed="|1Tim|1|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.1.17">1 Tim. i. 17</scripRef></p></note> And yet, I could still go on to
demand, in what manner &#8220;He was found in fashion as a man,&#8221;
before He had taken our flesh, seeing that his feet were washed,
and that He fed upon earthly food? How could that be, when He was
still &#8220;in the form of God, and thought it not robbery to be equal
with God?&#8221;<note place="end" n="282" id="iv.i.iv.xii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Phil. ii. 6, 7" id="iv.i.iv.xii-p4.2" parsed="|Phil|2|6|2|7" osisRef="Bible:Phil.2.6-Phil.2.7">Phil. ii. 6, 7</scripRef></p></note> For, pray,
had He already &#8220;emptied Himself, taking upon Him the form of a
servant, and made in the likeness of men, and found in fashion as a
man?&#8221; when we know when it was that He did this through His birth
of the Virgin. How, then, before He had done this, did He appear as
one man to Abraham? or, was not that form a reality? I could put
these questions, if it had been one man that appeared to Abraham,
and if that one were believed to be the Son of God. But since three
men appeared, and no one of them is said to be greater than the
rest either in form, or age, or power, why should we not here
understand, as visibly intimated by the visible creature, the
equality of the Trinity, and one and the same substance in three
persons?<note place="end" n="283" id="iv.i.iv.xii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xii-p5"> [The theophanies of the Pentateuch

lost sight of to some extent in the modern construction of the

that one among the three is in this way intimated to have been the
greater, and that this one is to be understood to have been the
Lord, the Son of God, while the other two were His angels; because,
whereas three appeared, Abraham there speaks to one as the Lord:
Holy Scripture has not forgotten to anticipate, by a contradiction,
such future cogitations and opinions, when a little while after it
says that two angels came to Lot, among whom that just man also,
who deserved to be freed from the burning of Sodom, speaks to one
as to the Lord. For so Scripture goes on to say, &#8220;And the Lord

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p2">&#8220;But there came two angels to
Sodom at even.&#8221; Here, what I have begun to set forth must be
considered more attentively. Certainly Abraham was speaking with
three, and called that one, in the singular number, the Lord.
Perhaps, some one may say, he recognized one of the three to be the
Lord, but the other two His angels. What, then, does that mean
which Scripture goes on to say, &#8220;And the Lord went His way, as
soon as He had left communing with Abraham; and Abraham returned to
his place: and there came two angels to Sodom at even?&#8221; Are we to
suppose that the one who, among the three, was recognized as the
Lord, had departed, and had sent the two angels that were with Him
to destroy Sodom? Let us see, then, what follows. &#8220;There came,&#8221;
it is said, &#8220;two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate
of Sodom: and Lot seeing them, rose up to meet them; and he bowed
himself with his face toward the ground; and he said, Behold now,
my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant&#8217;s house.&#8221; Here
it is clear, both that there were two angels, and that in the
plural number they were invited to partake of hospitality, and that
they were honorably designated lords, when they perchance were
thought to be men.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p3">22. Yet, again, it is objected that
except they were known to be angels of God, Lot would not have
bowed himself with his face to the ground. Why, then, is both
hospitality and food offered to them, as though they wanted such
human succor? But whatever may here lie hid, let us now pursue that
which we have undertaken. Two appear; both are called angels; they
are invited plurally; he speaks as with two plurally, until the
departure from Sodom. And then Scripture goes on to say, &#8220;And it
came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that they
said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou
in all the plain; escape to the mountain, and there thou shalt be
saved,<note place="end" n="285" id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p4"> This clause is not in the

meant by his saying to them, &#8220;Oh! not so, my lord,&#8221; if He who
was the Lord had already departed, and had sent the angels? Why is
it said, &#8220;Oh! not so, my lord,&#8221; and not, &#8220;Oh! not so, my
lords?&#8221; Or if he wished to speak to one of them, why does
Scripture say, &#8220;But Lot said to them, Oh! not so, my lord: behold
now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight,&#8221; etc.? Are we
here, too, to understand two persons in the plural number, but when
the two are addressed as one, then the one Lord God of one
substance? But which two persons do we here understand?&#8212;of the
Father and of the Son, or of the Father and of the Holy Spirit, or
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit? The last, perhaps, is the more
suitable; for they said of themselves that they were sent, which is
that which we say of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. For we find
nowhere in the Scriptures that the Father was sent.<note place="end" n="287" id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p6"> [It is difficult to determine the

the children of Israel out of Egypt, it is written that the Lord
appeared to him thus: &#8220;Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his
father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the
back side of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to
Horeb. And the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of
fire, out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and, behold, the
bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses
said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush
is not burnt. And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see,
God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, I am
the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob.&#8221;<note place="end" n="288" id="iv.i.iv.xiv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xiv-p3"> <scripRef passage="Ex. iii. 1-6" id="iv.i.iv.xiv-p3.2" parsed="|Exod|3|1|3|6" osisRef="Bible:Exod.3.1-Exod.3.6">Ex. iii. 1&#8211;6</scripRef></p></note> He is here also first called the

therefore, &#8220;who is over all, God blessed for ever,&#8221; is not
unreasonably here understood also to be Himself the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. But why is He previously
called the Angel of the Lord, when He appeared in a flame of fire
out of the bush? Was it because it was one of many angels, who by
an economy [or arrangement] bare the person of his Lord? or was
something of the creature assumed by Him in order to bring about a
visible appearance for the business in hand, and that words might
thence be audibly uttered, whereby the presence of the Lord might
be shown, in such way as was fitting, to the corporeal senses of
man, by means of the creature made subject? For if he was one of
the angels, who could easily affirm whether it was the person of
the Son which was imposed upon him to announce, or that of the Holy
Spirit, or that of God the Father, or altogether of the Trinity
itself, who is the one and only God, in order that he might say,
&#8220;I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob?&#8221; For we cannot say that the Son of God is the God of
Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and that the
Father is not; nor will any one dare to deny that either the Holy
Spirit, or the Trinity itself, whom we believe and understand to be
the one God, is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob. For he who is not God, is not the God of those
fathers. Furthermore, if not only the Father is God, as all, even
heretics, admit; but also the Son, which, whether they will or not,
they are compelled to acknowledge, since the apostle says, &#8220;Who
is over all, God blessed for ever;&#8221; and the Holy Spirit, since
the same apostle says, &#8220;Therefore glorify God in your body;&#8221;
when he had said above, &#8220;Know ye not that your body is the temple
of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God?&#8221;<note place="end" n="290" id="iv.i.iv.xiv-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xiv-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 20, 19" id="iv.i.iv.xiv-p5.2" parsed="|1Cor|6|20|0|0;|1Cor|6|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.20 Bible:1Cor.6.19">1 Cor. vi. 20, 19</scripRef></p></note> and these
three are one God, as catholic soundness believes: it is not

assumed for the purpose of the business in hand, whereby both to
appear to human eyes, and to sound in human ears, and to be called
the Angel of the Lord, and the Lord, and God; then cannot God here
be understood to be the Father, but either the Son or the Holy
Spirit. Although I cannot call to mind that the Holy Spirit is
anywhere else called an angel, which yet may be understood from His
work; for it is said of Him, &#8220;And He will show you<note place="end" n="291" id="iv.i.iv.xiv-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xiv-p6"> <i>Annuntiabit</i></p></note> things to

dared to say that they were the substance of God the Father. All
these things, then, were wrought through the creature serving the
Creator, and were presented in a suitable economy

is said, &#8220;And Moses drew near to the cloud where God was,&#8221;
carnal thoughts must needs suppose that the cloud was indeed seen
by the people, but that within the cloud Moses with the eyes of the
flesh saw the Son of God, whom doting heretics will have to be seen
in His own substance. Forsooth, Moses may have seen Him with the
eyes of the flesh, if not only the wisdom of God which is Christ,
but even that of any man you please and howsoever wise, can be seen
with the eyes of the flesh; or if, because it is written of the
elders of Israel, that &#8220;they saw the place where the God of
Israel had stood,&#8221; and that &#8220;there was under His feet as it

the slaying of the lamb and the celebration of the Passover until

had promised. And in that very coming of His, which we read of in
the Acts of the Apostles, there appeared cloven tongues like as of
fire, and it sat upon each of them:<note place="end" n="307" id="iv.i.iv.xvi-p13.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xvi-p14"> <scripRef passage="Acts. ii. 1-4" id="iv.i.iv.xvi-p14.2" parsed="|Acts|2|1|2|4" osisRef="Bible:Acts.2.1-Acts.2.4">Acts. ii. 1&#8211;4</scripRef></p></note> which agrees with Exodus, where it
is written, &#8220;And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because
the Lord descended upon it in fire;&#8221; and a little after, &#8220;And

things were therefore wrought because neither the Father nor the

by whom the Law itself must needs be written; then we know
doubtless that God appeared there, not by His own substance, which
remains invisible and unchangeable, but by the appearance above
mentioned of the creature; but that some special person of the
Trinity appeared, distinguished by a proper mark, as far as my

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iv.xvii-p2">26. There is yet another difficulty
which troubles most people, <i>viz</i>. that it is written, &#8220;And
the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his
friend;&#8221; whereas a little after, the same Moses says, &#8220;Now
therefore, I pray Thee, if I have found grace in Thy sight, show me
now Thyself plainly, that I may see Thee, that I may find grace in
Thy sight, and that I may consider that this nation is Thy
people;&#8221; and a little after Moses again said to the Lord, &#8220;Show
me Thy glory.&#8221; What means this then, that in everything which was
done, as above said, God was thought to have appeared by His own
substance; whence the Son of God has been believed by these
miserable people to be visible not by the creature, but by Himself;
and that Moses, entering into the cloud, appeared to have had this
very object in entering, that a cloudy darkness indeed might be
shown to the eyes of the people, but that Moses within might hear
the words of God, as though he beheld His face; and, as it is said,
&#8220;And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh
unto his friend;&#8221; and yet, behold, the same Moses says, &#8220;If I
have found grace in Thy sight, show me Thyself plainly?&#8221;
Assuredly he knew that he saw corporeally, and he sought the true
sight of God spiritually. And that mode of speech accordingly which
was wrought in words, was so modified, as if it were of a friend
speaking to a friend. Yet who sees God the Father with the eyes of
the body? And that Word, which was in the beginning, the Word which
was with God, the Word which was God, by which all things were
made,<note place="end" n="309" id="iv.i.iv.xvii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xvii-p3"> <scripRef passage="John i. 1, 3" id="iv.i.iv.xvii-p3.2" parsed="|John|1|1|0|0;|John|1|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.1 Bible:John.1.3">John i. 1, 3</scripRef></p></note>&#8212;who sees
Him with the eyes of the body? And the spirit of wisdom, again, who
sees with the eyes of the body? Yet what is, &#8220;Show me now Thyself
plainly, that I may see Thee,&#8221; unless, Show me Thy substance? But
if Moses had not said this, we must indeed have borne with those
foolish people as we could, who think that the substance of God was
made visible to his eyes through those things which, as above
mentioned, were said or done. But when it is here demonstrated most
evidently that this was <i>not granted</i> to him, even though he
desired it; who will dare to say, that by the like forms which had
appeared visibly to him also, not the creature serving God, but
that itself which is God, appeared to the eyes of a mortal
man?</p>

which were spoken in Exodus, and in all those corporeal
appearances, the Lord Jesus Christ was manifested; or if in some
cases Christ was manifested, as the consideration of this passage
persuades us, in others the Holy Spirit, as that which we have said
above admonishes us; at any rate no such result follows, as that
God the Father never appeared in any such form to the Fathers. For
many such appearances happened in those times, without either the
Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit being expressly named and
designated in them; but yet with some intimations given through
certain very probable interpretations, so that it would be too rash
to say that God the Father never appeared by any visible forms to
the fathers or the prophets. For they gave birth to this opinion

say, that the Father is therefore not visible, because He appeared
within the sight of one who was dreaming; but that therefore the
Son and the Holy Spirit are visible, because Moses saw all those

Wisdom of God with fleshly eyes, or that even the human spirit

who can fashion the likeness of a body to signify Himself through
the visions of dreamers, also fashion that same bodily creature to
signify Himself to the eyes of those who are awake? Whereas His own
very substance, whereby He Himself is that which He is, cannot be
shown by any bodily likeness to one who sleeps, or by any bodily
appearance to one who is awake; but this not of the Father only,
but also of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. And certainly, as to
those who are moved by the visions of waking men to believe that

father Abraham, who was certainly awake and ministering, when,
after Scripture had premised, &#8220;The Lord appeared unto Abraham,&#8221;

any distinction of persons, as it is said, the one and only God,

forms of the creature: now that we have examined, so far as
appeared to be sufficient what places of the Holy Scriptures we
could, a modest and cautious consideration of divine mysteries
leads, as far as I can judge, to no other conclusion, unless that
we may not rashly affirm which person of the Trinity appeared to
this or that of the fathers or the prophets in some body or
likeness of body, unless when the context attaches to the narrative
some probable intimations on the subject. For the nature itself, or
substance, or essence, or by whatever other name that very thing,
which is God, whatever it be, is to be called, cannot be seen
corporeally: but we must believe that by means of the creature made
subject to Him, not only the Son, or the Holy Spirit, but also the
Father, may have given intimations of Himself to mortal senses by a
corporeal form or likeness. And since the case stands thus, that
this second book may not extend to an immoderate length, let us

sufficiently set forth, or is not to be found at all, or at any
rate cannot easily be found by us, in the Latin tongue, while we
are not so familiar with the Greek tongue as to be found in any way
competent to read and understand therein the books that treat of
such topics, in which class of writings, to judge by the little
which has been translated for us, I do not doubt that everything is
contained that we can profitably seek;<note place="end" n="351" id="iv.i.v.i-p3.4"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.i-p4"> [This is an important passage with
reference to Augustin&#8217;s learning. From it, it would appear that
he had not read the Greek Trinitarians in the original, and that
only &#8220;a little&#8221; of these had been translated, at the time when
he was composing this treatise. As this was from <span class="c19" id="iv.i.v.i-p4.1">
A.D.</span> 400 to <span class="c19" id="iv.i.v.i-p4.2">A.D.</span> 416&#8212;, the
treatises of Athanasius (d. 373), Basil (d. 379), Gregory of Nyssa
(d. 400?), and Gregory of Nazianzum (d. 390?) had been composed and
were current in the Eastern church. That Augustin thought out this
profound scheme of the doctrine of the Trinity by the close study
of Scripture alone, and unassisted by the equally profound
trinitarianism of the Greek church, is an evidence of the depth and
strength of his remarkable intellect.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> while yet I cannot resist my
brethren when they exact of me, by that law by which I am made
their servant, that I should minister above all to their
praiseworthy studies in Christ by my tongue and by my pen, of which
two yoked together in me, Love is the charioteer; and while I
myself confess that I have by writing learned many things which I
did not know: if this be so, then this my labor ought not to seem
superfluous to any idle, or to any very learned reader; while it is
needful in no small part, to many who are busy, and to many who are
unlearned, and among these last to myself. Supported, then, very
greatly, and aided by the writings we have already read of others
on this subject, I have undertaken to inquire into and to discuss,
whatever it seems to my judgment can be reverently inquired into
and discussed, concerning the Trinity, the one supreme and
supremely good God; He himself exhorting me to the inquiry, and
helping me in the discussion of it; in order that, if there are no
other writings of the kind, there may be something for those to
have and read who <pb n="56" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_56.html" id="iv.i.v.i-Page_56"/>are willing and capable; but if
any exist already, then it may be so much the easier to find some
such writings, the more there are of the kind in
existence.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.i-p5">2. Assuredly, as in all my writings
I desire not only a pious reader, but also a free corrector, so I
especially desire this in the present inquiry, which is so
important that I would there were as many inquirers as there are
objectors. But as I do not wish my reader to be bound down to me,
so I do not wish my corrector to be bound down to himself. Let not
the former love me more than the catholic faith, let not the latter
love himself more than the catholic verity. As I say to the former,
Do not be willing to yield to my writings as to the canonical
Scriptures; but in these, when thou hast discovered even what thou
didst not previously believe, believe it unhesitatingly; while in
those, unless thou hast understood with certainty what thou didst
not before hold as certain, be unwilling to hold it fast: so I say
to the latter, Do not be willing to amend my writings by thine own
opinion or disputation, but from the divine text, or by
unanswerable reason. If thou apprehendest anything of truth in
them, its being there does not make it mine, but by understanding
and loving it, let it be both thine and mine; but if thou
convictest anything of falsehood, though it have once been mine, in
that I was guilty of the error, yet now by avoiding it let it be
neither thine nor mine.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.i-p6">3. Let this third book, then, take
its beginning at the point to which the second had reached. For
after we had arrived at this, that we desired to show that the Son
was not therefore less than the Father, because the Father sent and
the Son was sent; nor the Holy Spirit therefore less than both,
because we read in the Gospel that He was sent both by the one and
by the other; we undertook then to inquire, since the Son was sent
thither, where He already was, for He came into the world, and
&#8220;was in the world;&#8221;<note place="end" n="352" id="iv.i.v.i-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.i-p7"> <scripRef passage="John i. 10" id="iv.i.v.i-p7.2" parsed="|John|1|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.10">John i. 10</scripRef></p></note> since also the Holy Spirit was sent
thither, where He already was, for &#8220;the Spirit of the Lord
filleth the world, and that which containeth all things hath

&#8220;sent&#8221; because He was born in the flesh so as to be no longer
hidden, and, as it were, came forth from the bosom of the Father,
and appeared to the eyes of men in the form of a servant; and the
Holy Spirit also was therefore &#8220;sent,&#8221; because He too was seen
as a dove in a corporeal form,<note place="end" n="354" id="iv.i.v.i-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.i-p9"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 3.16" id="iv.i.v.i-p9.1" parsed="|Matt|3|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.16">Matt. iii. 16</scripRef></p></note> and in cloven tongues, like as of

be sent, when spoken of them, means to go forth to the sight of
mortals in some corporeal form from a spiritual hiding-place;
which, because the Father did not, He is said only to have sent,
not also to be sent. Our next inquiry was, Why the Father also is
not sometimes said to be sent, if He Himself was manifested through
those corporeal forms which appeared to the eyes of the ancients.
But if the Son was manifested at these times, why should He be said
to be &#8220;sent&#8221; so long after, when the fullness of time was come
that He should be born of a woman;<note place="end" n="356" id="iv.i.v.i-p10.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.i-p11"> <scripRef passage="Gal. iv. 4" id="iv.i.v.i-p11.2" parsed="|Gal|4|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.4.4">Gal. iv. 4</scripRef></p></note> since, indeed, He was sent before
also, <i>viz</i>., when He appeared corporeally in those forms? Or

was made flesh;<note place="end" n="357" id="iv.i.v.i-p11.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.i-p12"> <scripRef passage="John i. 14" id="iv.i.v.i-p12.2" parsed="|John|1|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.14">John i. 14</scripRef></p></note> why should
the Holy Spirit be read of as &#8220;sent,&#8221; of whom such an
incarnation never took place? But if neither the Father, nor the
Son, but the Holy Spirit was manifested through these ancient
appearances; why should He too be said to be &#8220;sent&#8221; now, when
He was also sent before in these various manners? Next we
subdivided the subject, that it might be handled most carefully,
and we made the question threefold, of which one part was explained
in the second book, and two remain, which I shall next proceed to
discuss. For we have already inquired and determined, that not only
the Father, nor only the Son, nor only the Holy Spirit appeared in
those ancient corporeal forms and visions, but either indifferently
the Lord God, who is understood to be the Trinity itself, or some
one person of the Trinity, whichever the text of the narrative
might signify, through intimations supplied by the
context.</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.v.ii-p1.1">Chapter 1.&#8212;What is to Be Said Thereupon.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.ii-p2">4. Let us, then, continue our
inquiry now in order. For under the second head in that division
the question occurred, whether the creature was formed for that
work only, wherein God, in such way as He then judged it to be
fitting, might be manifested to human sight; or whether angels, who
already existed, were so sent as to speak in the person of God,
assuming a corporeal appearance from the corporeal creature for the
purpose of their ministry; or else changing and turning their own
body itself, to which they are not subject, but govern it as
subject to themselves, into whatever forms they would, that were
appropriate and fit for their actions, according to the power given
to them by the Creator. And when this part of the question shall
have been investigated, so far as God permit, then,
last<pb n="57" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_57.html" id="iv.i.v.ii-Page_57"/>ly, we shall have to see to that question with which we
started, <i>viz</i>., whether the Son and the Holy Spirit were also
&#8220;sent&#8221; before; and if it be so, then what difference there is
between that sending and the one of which we read in the Gospel; or
whether neither of them were sent, except when either the Son was
made of the Virgin Mary, or when the Holy Spirit appeared in a
visible form, whether as a dove or in tongues of fire.<note place="end" n="358" id="iv.i.v.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.ii-p3"> See above, Book ii. chap. vii. n.
13.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.ii-p4">5. I confess, however, that it
reaches further than my purpose can carry me to inquire whether the
angels, secretly working by the spiritual quality of their body
abiding still in them, assume somewhat from the inferior and more
bodily elements, which, being fitted to themselves, they may change
and turn like a garment into any corporeal appearances they will,
and those appearances themselves also real, as real water was
changed by our Lord into real wine;<note place="end" n="359" id="iv.i.v.ii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.ii-p5"> <scripRef passage="John ii. 9" id="iv.i.v.ii-p5.2" parsed="|John|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.2.9">John ii. 9</scripRef></p></note> or whether they transform their own
bodies themselves into that which they would, suitably to the
particular act. But it does not signify to the present question
which of these it is. And although I be not able to understand
these things by actual experience, seeing that I am a man, as the
angels do who do these things, and know them better than I know
them, <i>viz</i>., how far my body is changeable by the operation
of my will; whether it be by my own experience of myself, or by
that which I have gathered from others; yet it is not necessary
here to say which of these alternatives I am to believe upon the
authority of the divine Scriptures, lest I be compelled to prove
it, and so my discourse become too long upon a subject which does
not concern the present question.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.ii-p6">6. Our present inquiry then is,
whether the angels were then the agents both in showing those
bodily appearances to the eyes of men and in sounding those words
in their ears when the sensible creature itself, serving the
Creator at His beck, was turned for the time into whatever was
needful; as it is written in the book of Wisdom, &#8220;For the
creature serveth Thee, who art the Maker, increaseth his strength
against the unrighteous for their punishment, and abateth his
strength for the benefit of such as put their trust in Thee.

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.iii-p2">7. But there is one kind of natural
order in the conversion and changeableness of bodies, which,
although itself also serves the bidding of God, yet by reason of
its unbroken continuity has ceased to cause wonder; as is the case,
for instance, with those things which are changed either in very
short, or at any rate not long, intervals of time, in heaven, or
earth, or sea; whether it be in rising, or in setting, or in change
of appearance from time to time; while there are other things,
which, although arising from that same order, yet are less familiar
on account of longer intervals of time. And these things, although
the many stupidly wonder at them, yet are understood by those who
inquire into this present world, and in the progress of generations
become so much the less wonderful, as they are the more often
repeated and known by more people. Such are the eclipses of the sun
and moon, and some kinds of stars, appearing seldom, and
earthquakes, and unnatural births of living creatures, and other
similar things; of which not one takes place without the will of
God; yet, that it is so, is to most people not apparent. And so the
vanity of philosophers has found license to assign these things
also to other causes, true causes perhaps, but proximate ones,
while they are not able to see at all the cause that is higher than
all others, that is, the will of God; or again to false causes, and
to such as are not even put forward out of any diligent
investigation of corporeal things and motions, but from their own
guess and error.</p>

if I can, that this may be plainer. There is, we know, in the human
body, a certain bulk of flesh and an outward form, and an
arrangement and distraction of limbs, and a temperament of health;
and a soul breathed into it governs this body, and that soul a
rational one; which, therefore, although changeable, yet can be
partaker of that unchangeable wisdom, so that &#8220;it may partake of

3.&#8212;Of the Same Argument.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.iv-p2">Let us take, then, the case of a
wise man, such that his rational soul is already partaker of the
unchangeable and eternal truth, so that he consults it about all
his actions, nor does anything at all, which he does not by it know
ought to be done, in order that by being subject to it and obeying
it he may do rightly. Suppose now that this man, upon counsel with
the highest reason of the divine righteousness, which he hears with
the ear of his heart in secret, and by its bidding, should weary
his body by toil in some office of mercy, and should contract an
illness; and upon consulting the physicians, were to be told by one
that the cause of the disease was overmuch dryness of the body, but
by another that it was overmuch moisture; one of the two no doubt
would allege the true cause and the other would err, but both would
pronounce concerning proximate causes only, that is, corporeal
ones. But if the cause of that dryness were to be inquired into,
and found to be the self-imposed toil, then we should have come to
a yet higher cause, which proceeds from the soul so as to affect
the body which the soul governs. Yet neither would this be the
first cause, for that doubtless was a higher cause still, and lay
in the unchangeable wisdom itself, by serving which in love, and by
obeying its ineffable commands, the soul of the wise man had
undertaken that self-imposed toil; and so nothing else but the will
of God would be found most truly to be the first cause of that
illness. But suppose now in that office of pious toil this wise man
had employed the help of others to co-operate in the good work, who
did not serve God with the same will as himself, but either desired
to attain the reward of their own carnal desires, or shunned merely
carnal unpleasantnesses;&#8212;suppose, too, he had employed beasts of
burden, if the completion of the work required such a provision,
which beasts of burden would be certainly irrational animals, and
would not therefore move their limbs under their burdens because
they at all thought of that good work, but from the natural
appetite of their own liking, and for the avoiding of
annoyance;&#8212;suppose, lastly, he had employed bodily things
themselves that lack all sense, but were necessary for that work,
as <i>e.g</i>. corn, and wine, and oils, clothes, or money, or a
book, or anything of the kind;&#8212;certainly, in all these bodily
things thus employed in this work, whether animate or inanimate,
whatever took place of movement, of wear and tear, of reparation,
of destruction, of renewal or of change in one way or another, as
places and times affected them; pray, could there be, I say, any
other cause of all these visible and changeable facts, except the
invisible and unchangeable will of God, using all these, both bad
and irrational souls, and lastly bodies, whether such as were
inspired and animated by those souls, or such as lacked all sense,
by means of that upright soul as the seat of His wisdom, since
primarily that good and holy soul itself employed them, which His
wisdom had subjected to itself in a pious and religious
obedience?</p>

extended also to a family, where there is a society of such men, or
to a city, or even to the whole world, if the chief rule and
government of human affairs were in the hands of the wise, and of
those who were piously and perfectly subject to God; but because
this is not the case as yet (for it behoves us first to be
exercised in this our pilgrimage after mortal fashion, and to be
taught with stripes by force of gentleness and patience), let us
turn our thoughts to that country itself that is above and

creature; first spiritual, then corporeal; and uses all according
to the unchangeable pleasure of its own purpose, whether
incorporeal things or things corporeal, whether rational or
irrational spirits, whether good by His grace or evil through their
own will. But as the more gross and inferior bodies are governed in
due order by the more subtle and powerful ones, so all bodies are
governed by the living spirit; and the living spirit devoid of
reason, by the reasonable living spirit; and the reasonable living
spirit that makes default and sins, by the living and reasonable
spirit that is pious and just; and that by God Himself, and so the
universal creature by its Creator, from whom and through whom and

of men to that visible form, yet is not sanctified to become so

since God works everything that is done in that work through
corporeal movements, by setting in motion primarily the invisible
things of His servants, whether the souls of men, or the services
of hidden spirits subject to Himself): what wonder if also in the
creature of heaven and earth, of sea and air, God works the
sensible and visible things which He wills, in order to signify and
manifest Himself in them, as He Himself knows it to be fitting,
without any appearing of His very substance itself, whereby He is,
which is altogether unchangeable, and more inwardly and secretly
exalted than all spirits whom He has created?</p>

weak judgment, namely, why such miracles are wrought also by magic
arts; for the wise men of Pharaoh likewise made serpents, and did
other like things. Yet it is still more a matter of wonder, how it
was that the power of those magicians, which was able to make
serpents, when it came to very small flies, failed altogether. For
the lice, by which third plague the proud people of Egypt were
smitten, are very short-lived little flies; yet there certainly the
magicians failed, saying, &#8220;This is the finger of God.&#8221;<note place="end" n="380" id="iv.i.v.viii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.viii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Ex. vii." id="iv.i.v.viii-p3.2" parsed="|Exod|7|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.7">Ex. vii.</scripRef> and viii</p></note> And hence it

magicians also themselves, in order that in the seducing of those
spirits they might seem admirable by whom they were wrought, but to
be condemned by the truth of God; or for the admonishing of the

serpents; for it was not they who created them. But, in truth, some
hidden seeds of all things that are born corporeally and visibly,
are concealed in the corporeal elements of this world. For those
seeds that are visible now to our eyes from fruits and living
things, are quite distinct from the hidden seeds of those former
seeds; from which, at the bidding of the Creator, the water
produced the first swimming creatures and fowl, and the earth the
first buds after their kind, and the first living creatures after
their kind.<note place="end" n="382" id="iv.i.v.ix-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.ix-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. i. 20-25" id="iv.i.v.ix-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|1|20|1|25" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.20-Gen.1.25">Gen. i. 20&#8211;25</scripRef></p></note> For neither
at that time were those seeds so drawn forth into products of their
several kinds, as that the power of production was exhausted in
those products; but oftentimes, suitable combinations of
circumstances are wanting, whereby they may be enabled to burst
forth and complete their species. For, consider, the very least
shoot is a seed; for, if fitly consigned to the earth, it produces
a tree. But of this shoot there is a yet more subtle seed in some
grain of the same species, and this is visible even to us. But of
this grain also there is further still a seed, which, although we
are unable to see it with our eyes, yet we can conjecture its
existence from our reason; because, except there were some such
power in those elements, there would not so frequently be produced
from the earth things which had not been sown there; nor
<pb n="61" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_61.html" id="iv.i.v.ix-Page_61"/>yet so
many animals, without any previous commixture of male and female;
whether on the land, or in the water, which yet grow, and by
commingling bring forth others, while themselves sprang up without
any union of parents. And certainly bees do not conceive the seeds
of their young by commixture, but gather them as they lie scattered
over the earth with their mouth.<note place="end" n="383" id="iv.i.v.ix-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.ix-p4"> [Augustin is not alone in his
belief that the bee is an exception to the dictum; <i>omne animal
ex ovo</i>. As late as 1744, Thorley, an English &#8220;scientist,&#8221;
said that &#8220;the manner in which bees propagate their species is
entirely hid from the eyes of all men; and the most strict,
diligent, and curious observers and inquisitors have not been able
to discover it. It is a secret, and will remain a mystery. Dr.
Butler says that they do not copulate as other living creatures
do.&#8221; (Thorley: Melisselogia. Section viii.) The observations of
Huber and others have disproved this opinion. Some infer that
ignorance of physics proves ignorance of philosophy and theology.
The difference between matter and mind is so great, that erroneous
opinions in one province are compatible with correct ones in the
other. It does not follow that because Augustin had wrong notions
about bees, and no knowledge at all of the steam engine and
telegraph, his knowledge of God and the soul was inferior to that
of a modern materialist.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> For the Creator of these invisible
seeds is the Creator of all things Himself; since whatever comes
forth to our sight by being born, receives the first beginnings of
its course from hidden seeds, and takes the successive increments
of its proper size and its distinctive forms from these as it were
original rules. As therefore we do not call parents the creators of
men, nor farmers the creators of corn,&#8212;although it is by the
outward application of their actions that the power<note place="end" n="384" id="iv.i.v.ix-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.ix-p5"> [The English translator renders
&#8220;<i>virtus</i>&#8221; in its secondary sense of &#8220;goodness.&#8221;
Augustin employs it here, in its primary sense of &#8220;energy,&#8221;
&#8220;force.&#8221;&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> of God
operates within for the creating these things;&#8212;so it is not right
to think not only the bad but even the good angels to be creators,
if, through the subtilty of their perception and body, they know
the seeds of things which to us are more hidden, and scatter them
secretly through fit temperings of the elements, and so furnish
opportunities of producing things, and of accelerating their
increase. But neither do the good angels do these things, except as
far as God commands, nor do the evil ones do them wrongfully,
except as far as He righteously permits. For the malignity of the
wicked one makes his own will wrongful; but the power to do so, he
receives rightfully, whether for his own punishment, or, in the
case of others, for the punishment of the wicked, or for the praise
of the good.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.ix-p6">14. Accordingly, the Apostle Paul,
distinguishing God&#8217;s creating and forming within, from the
operations of the creature which are applied from without, and
drawing a similitude from agriculture, says, &#8220;I planted, Apollos
watered; but God gave the increase.&#8221;<note place="end" n="385" id="iv.i.v.ix-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.ix-p7"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. iii. 6" id="iv.i.v.ix-p7.2" parsed="|1Cor|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.6">1 Cor. iii. 6</scripRef></p></note> As, therefore, in the case of
spiritual life itself, no one except God can work righteousness in
our minds, yet men also are able to preach the gospel as an outward
means, not only the good in sincerity, but also the evil in
pretence;<note place="end" n="386" id="iv.i.v.ix-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.ix-p8"> <scripRef passage="Phil. i. 18" id="iv.i.v.ix-p8.2" parsed="|Phil|1|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.1.18">Phil. i. 18</scripRef></p></note> so in the
creation of visible things it is God that works from within; but
the exterior operations, whether of good or bad, of angels or men,
or even of any kind of animal, according to His own absolute power,
and to the distribution of faculties, and the several appetites for
things pleasant, which He Himself has imparted, are applied by Him
to that nature of things wherein He creates all things, in like
manner as agriculture is to the soil. Wherefore I can no more call
the bad angels, evoked by magic arts, the creators of the frogs and
serpents, than I can say that bad men were creators of the corn
crop, which I see to have sprung up through their labor.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.ix-p9">15. Just as Jacob, again, was not
the creator of the colors in the flocks, because he placed the
various colored rods for the several mothers, as they drank, to
look at in conceiving.<note place="end" n="387" id="iv.i.v.ix-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.ix-p10"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xxx. 41" id="iv.i.v.ix-p10.2" parsed="|Gen|30|41|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.30.41">Gen. xxx. 41</scripRef></p></note> Yet neither were the cattle
themselves creators of the variety of their own offspring, because
the variegated image, impressed through their eyes by the sight of
the varied rods, clave to their soul, but could affect the body
that was animated by the spirit thus affected only through sympathy
with this commingling, so far as to stain with color the tender
beginnings of their offspring. For that they are so affected from
themselves, whether the soul from the body, or the body from the
soul, arises in truth from suitable reasons, which immutably exist
in that highest wisdom of God Himself, which no extent of place
contains; and which, while it is itself unchangeable, yet quits not
one even of those things which are changeable, because there is not
one of them that is not created by itself. For it was the
unchangeable and invisible reason of the wisdom of God, by which
all things are created, which caused not rods, but cattle, to be
born from cattle; but that the color of the cattle conceived should
be in any degree influenced by the variety of the rods, came to
pass through the soul of the pregnant cattle being affected through
their eyes from without, and so according to its own measure
drawing inwardly within itself the rule of formation, which it
received from the innermost power of its own Creator. How great,
however, may be the power of the soul in affecting and changing
corporeal substance (although certainly it cannot be called the
creator of the body, because every cause of changeable and sensible
substance, and all its <pb n="62" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_62.html" id="iv.i.v.ix-Page_62"/>measure and number and weight,
by which are brought to pass both its being at all and its being of
such and such a nature, arise from the intelligible and
unchangeable life, which is above all things, and which reaches
even to the most distant and earthly things), is a very copious
subject, and one not now necessary. But I thought the act of Jacob
about the cattle should be noticed, for this reason, <i>viz</i>. in
order that it might be perceived that, if the man who thus placed
those rods cannot be called the creator of the colors in the lambs
and kids; nor yet even the souls themselves of the mothers, which
colored the seeds conceived in the flesh by the image of variegated
color, conceived through the eyes of the body, so far as nature
permitted it; much less can it be said that the creators of the
frogs and serpents were the bad angels, through whom the magicians
of Pharaoh then made them.</p>

administer the creature from the innermost and highest
turning-point of causation, which He alone does who is God the
Creator; but quite another thing to apply some operation from
without in proportion to the strength and faculties assigned to
each by Him, so that what is created may come forth into being at
this time or at that, and in this or that way. For all these things
in the way of original and beginning have already been created in a
kind of texture of the elements, but they come forth when they get
the opportunity.<note place="end" n="388" id="iv.i.v.x-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.x-p3"> [This is the same as the
theological distinction between substances and their modifications.
&#8220;The former,&#8221; says Howe, &#8220;are the proper object of creation
strictly taken; the modifications of things are not properly

brought forth out of those substantial things that were themselves
created, or made out of nothing.&#8221;&#8212;Germs are originated <i>ex

development takes place according to the nature and inherent force
of the germ, and falls under providence, in distinction from

mothers are pregnant with young, so the world itself is pregnant

it, except from that highest essence, where nothing either springs
up or dies, either begins to be or ceases. But the applying from
without of adventitious causes, which, although they are not
natural, yet are to be applied according to nature, in order that
those things which are contained and hidden in the secret bosom of
nature may break forth and be outwardly created in some way by the
unfolding of the proper measures and numbers and weights which they
have received in secret from Him &#8220;who has ordered all things in

bad angels, but also of bad men, as I have shown above by the
example of agriculture.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.x-p5">17. But lest the somewhat different
condition of animals should trouble any one, in that they have the
breath of life with the sense of desiring those things that are
according to nature, and of avoiding those things that are contrary
to it; we must consider also, how many men there are who know from
what herbs or flesh, or from what juices or liquids you please, of
whatever sort, whether so placed or so buried, or so bruised or so
mixed, this or that animal is commonly born; yet who can be so
foolish as to dare to call himself the creator of these animals? Is
it, therefore, to be wondered at, if just as any, the most
worthless of men, can know whence such or such worms and flies are
produced; so the evil angels in proportion to the subtlety of their
perceptions discern in the more hidden seeds of the elements whence
frogs and serpents are produced, and so through certain and known
opportune combinations applying these seeds by secret movements,
cause them to be created, but do not create them? Only men do not
marvel at those things that are usually done by men. But if any one
chance to wonder at the quickness of those growths, in that those
living beings were so quickly made, let him consider how even this
may be brought about by men in proportion to the measure of human
capability. For whence is it that the same bodies generate worms
more quickly in summer than in winter, or in hotter than in colder
places? Only these things are applied by men with so much the more
difficulty, in proportion as their earthly and sluggish members are
wanting in subtlety of perception, and in rapidity of bodily
motion. And hence it arises that in the case of any kind of angels,
in proportion as it is easier for them to draw out the proximate
causes from the elements, so much the more marvellous is their
rapidity in works of this kind.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.x-p6">18. But He only is the creator who
is the chief former of these things. Neither can any one be this,
unless He with whom primarily rests the measure, number, and weight
of all things existing; and He is God the one Creator, by whose
unspeakable power it comes to pass, also, that what these angels
were able to do if they were permitted, they are therefore not able
to do because they are not permitted. For there is no other reason
why they who made frogs and serpents were not able to make the most
minute flies, unless because <pb n="63" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_63.html" id="iv.i.v.x-Page_63"/>the greater power of God was

they are able to do by nature, yet cannot do, because they are
prohibited; and what the very condition of their nature itself does

mentions when he says, &#8220;To another the discerning of
spirits.&#8221;<note place="end" n="391" id="iv.i.v.x-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.x-p8"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xii. 10" id="iv.i.v.x-p8.2" parsed="|1Cor|12|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.10">1 Cor. xii. 10</scripRef></p></note> For we know
that a man can walk, yet that he cannot do so if he is not

those angels, also, are able to do certain things if they are
permitted by more powerful angels, according to the supreme
commandment of God; but cannot do certain other things, not even if
they are permitted by them; because He does not permit from whom
they have received such and such a measure of natural powers: who,
even by His angels, does not usually permit what He has given them
power to be able to do.</p>

stormy wind,&#8221; lest any one should think those to be brought about

things as I just now said, there are some also of another kind;

person of God Himself assumed in all things which are announced to
us by the Lord God. When, however, that person is assumed, it is
sometimes made manifest as an angel; sometimes in that form which
is not an angel in his own proper being, although it is ordered and
ministered by an angel. Again, when it is assumed in that form
which is not an angel in his own proper being; sometimes in this
case it is a body itself already existing, assumed after some kind
of change, in order to make that message manifest; sometimes it is
one that comes into being for the purpose, and that being
accomplished, is discarded. Just as, also, when men are the
messengers, sometimes they speak the words of God in their own
person, as when it is premised, &#8220;The Lord said,&#8221; or, &#8220;Thus

act, the signifying of the person of God is imposed upon the
prophet, in order that he may bear that person in the ministering
of the prophecy; just as he, for instance, bore that person who
divided his garment into twelve parts, and gave ten of them to the
servant of King Solomon, to the future king of Israel.<note place="end" n="395" id="iv.i.v.xi-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xi-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 Kings xi. 30, 31" id="iv.i.v.xi-p5.2" parsed="|1Kgs|11|30|11|31" osisRef="Bible:1Kgs.11.30-1Kgs.11.31">1 Kings xi. 30, 31</scripRef></p></note> Sometimes,
also, a thing which was not a prophet in his own proper self, and
which existed already among earthly things, was assumed in order to
signify this; as Jacob, when he had seen the dream, upon waking up
did with the stone, which when asleep he had under his head.<note place="end" n="396" id="iv.i.v.xi-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xi-p6"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xxviii. 18" id="iv.i.v.xi-p6.2" parsed="|Gen|28|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.28.18">Gen. xxviii. 18</scripRef></p></note> Sometimes a
thing is made in the same kind, for the mere purpose; so as either
to continue a little while in existence, as that brazen serpent was

known to men, in that they are done by men, they may well meet with
reverence as being holy things, but they cannot cause wonder as
being miracles. And therefore those things which are done by angels
are the more wonderful to us, in that they are more difficult and

wide difference between the deed of the angel and the deed of the

understood, are different. Just as if the name of God were written
both in gold and in ink; the former would be the more precious, the
latter the more worthless; yet that which is signified in both is
one and the same. And although the serpent that came from Moses&#8217;
rod signified the same thing as Jacob&#8217;s stone, yet Jacob&#8217;s
stone signified something better than did the serpents of the

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.xi-p21">21. What man, again, knows how the
angels made or took those clouds and fires in order to signify the
message they were bearing, even if we supposed that the Lord or the
Holy Spirit was manifested in those corporeal forms? Just as
infants do not know of that which is placed upon the altar and
consumed after the performance of the holy celebration, whence or
in what manner it is made, or whence it is taken for religious use.
And if they were never to learn from their own experience or that
of others, and never to see that species of thing except during the
celebration of the sacrament, when it is being offered and given;
and if it were told them by the most weighty authority whose body

resembled this. But it is certainly a useful caution to myself,
that I should remember what my own powers are, and admonish my
brethren that they also remember what theirs are, lest human
infirmity pass on beyond what is safe. For how the angels do these
things, or rather, how God does these things by His angels, and how
far He wills them to be done even by the bad angels, whether by
permitting, or commanding, or compelling, from the hidden seat of
His own supreme power; this I can neither penetrate by the sight of
the eyes, nor make clear by assurance of reason, nor be carried on
to comprehend it by reach of intellect, so as to speak thereupon to
all questions that may be asked respecting these matters, as
certainly as if I were an angel, or a prophet, or an apostle.
&#8220;For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devices
are but uncertain. For the corruptible body presseth down the soul,
and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down the mind, that museth upon
many things. And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon
earth, and with labor do we find the things that are before us; but
the things that are in heaven, who hath searched out?&#8221; But

say confidently, that neither God the Father, nor His Word, nor His

that which He is, and whereby He is that which He is; and much less
is in this regard visible. Since there are no doubt some things
changeable, yet not visible, as are our thoughts, and memories, and

that all those appearances to the fathers, when God was presented
to them according to His own dispensation, suitable to the times,
were wrought through the creature. And if we cannot discern in what
manner He wrought them by ministry of angels, yet we say that they
were wrought by angels; but not from our own power of discernment,

authority is extant of the divine Scriptures, from which our reason
ought not to turn aside; nor by leaving the solid support of the
divine utterance, to fall headlong over the precipice of its own
surmisings, in matters wherein neither the perceptions of the body
rule, nor the clear reason of the truth shines forth. Now,
certainly, it is written most clearly in the Epistle to the
Hebrews, when the dispensation of the New Testament was to be
distinguished from the dispensation of the Old, according to the
fitness of ages and of times, that not only those visible things,
but also the word itself, was wrought by angels. For it is said
thus: &#8220;But to which of the angels said He at any time, Sit on my
right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool? Are they not
all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall
be heirs of salvation?&#8221;<note place="end" n="415" id="iv.i.v.xii-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p7"> <scripRef passage="Heb. i. 13, 14" id="iv.i.v.xii-p7.2" parsed="|Heb|1|13|1|14" osisRef="Bible:Heb.1.13-Heb.1.14">Heb. i. 13, 14</scripRef></p></note> Whence it appears that all those
things were not only wrought by angels, but wrought also on our
account, that is, on account of the people of God, to whom is
promised the inheritance of eternal life. As it is written also to
the Corinthians, &#8220;Now all these things happened unto them in a
figure: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends
of the world are come.&#8221;<note place="end" n="416" id="iv.i.v.xii-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p8"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 11" id="iv.i.v.xii-p8.2" parsed="|1Cor|10|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.11">1 Cor. x. 11</scripRef></p></note> And then, demonstrating by plain
consequence that as at that time the word was spoken by the angels,

any time we should let them slip. For if the word spoken by angels
was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a
just recompense of reward; how shall we escape, if we neglect so
great salvation?&#8221; And then, as though you asked, What
salvation?&#8212;in order to show that he is now speaking of the New
Testament, that is, of the word which was spoken not by angels, but
by the Lord, he says, &#8220;Which at the first began to be spoken by
the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard Him; God
also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with
divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to His own
will.&#8221;<note place="end" n="417" id="iv.i.v.xii-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p9"> <scripRef passage="Heb. ii. 1-4" id="iv.i.v.xii-p9.2" parsed="|Heb|2|1|2|4" osisRef="Bible:Heb.2.1-Heb.2.4">Heb. ii. 1&#8211;4</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.xii-p10">23. But some one may say, Why then
is it written, &#8220;The Lord said to Moses;&#8221; and not, rather, The
angel said to Moses? Because, when the crier proclaims the words of
the judge, it is not usually written in the record, so and so the
crier said, but so and so the judge. In like manner also, when the
holy prophet speaks, although we say, The prophet said, we mean
nothing else to be understood than that the Lord said; and if we
were to say, The Lord said, we should not put the prophet aside,
but only intimate who spake by him. And, indeed, these Scriptures
often reveal the angel to be the Lord, of whose speaking it is from
time to time said, &#8220;the Lord said,&#8221; as we have shown already.
But on account of those who, since the Scripture in that place
specifies an angel, will have the Son of God Himself and in
<pb n="66" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_66.html" id="iv.i.v.xii-Page_66"/>Himself
to be understood, because He is called an angel by the prophet, as
announcing the will of His Father and of Himself; I have therefore
thought fit to produce a plainer testimony from this epistle, where
it is not said by an angel, but &#8220;by angels.&#8221;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.xii-p11">24. For Stephen, too, in the Acts
of the Apostles, relates these things in that manner in which they
are also written in the Old Testament: &#8220;Men, brethren, and
fathers, hearken,&#8221; he says; &#8220;The God of glory appeared unto our
father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia.&#8221;<note place="end" n="418" id="iv.i.v.xii-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p12"> <scripRef passage="Acts vii. 2" id="iv.i.v.xii-p12.2" parsed="|Acts|7|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.7.2">Acts vii. 2</scripRef></p></note> But lest any one should think that
the God of glory appeared then to the eyes of any mortal in that
which He is in Himself, he goes on to say that an angel appeared to
Moses. &#8220;Then fled Moses,&#8221; he says, &#8220;at that saying, and was a
stranger in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons. And when
forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness
of mount Sinai an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.
When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to
behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying, I am the
God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold. Then
said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet,&#8221;<note place="end" n="419" id="iv.i.v.xii-p12.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p13"> <scripRef passage="Ex. ii. 15" id="iv.i.v.xii-p13.2" parsed="|Exod|2|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.2.15">Ex. ii. 15</scripRef> and iii.

certainly, he speaks both of angel and of Lord; and of the same as
the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; as
is written in Genesis.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.xii-p14">25. Can there be any one who will
say that the Lord appeared to Moses by an angel, but to Abraham by
Himself? Let us not answer this question from Stephen, but from the
book itself, whence Stephen took his narrative. For, pray, because
it is written, &#8220;And the Lord God said unto Abraham;&#8221;<note place="end" n="420" id="iv.i.v.xii-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p15"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xii. 1" id="iv.i.v.xii-p15.2" parsed="|Gen|12|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.12.1">Gen. xii. 1</scripRef></p></note> and a little
after, &#8220;And the Lord God appeared unto Abraham;&#8221;<note place="end" n="421" id="iv.i.v.xii-p15.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p16"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xvii. 1" id="iv.i.v.xii-p16.2" parsed="|Gen|17|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.17.1">Gen. xvii. 1</scripRef></p></note> were these
things, for this reason, not done by angels? Whereas it is said in
like manner in another place, &#8220;And the Lord appeared to him in
the plains of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the
day;&#8221; and yet it is added immediately, &#8220;And he lift up his eyes
and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him:&#8221;<note place="end" n="422" id="iv.i.v.xii-p16.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p17"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xviii. 1, 2" id="iv.i.v.xii-p17.2" parsed="|Gen|18|1|18|2" osisRef="Bible:Gen.18.1-Gen.18.2">Gen. xviii. 1, 2</scripRef></p></note> of whom we have already spoken. For
how will these people, who either will not rise from the words to
the meaning, or easily throw themselves down from the meaning to
the words,&#8212;how, I say, will they be able to explain that God was
seen in three men, except they confess that they were angels, as
that which follows also shows? Because it is not said an angel
spoke or appeared to him, will they therefore venture to say that
the vision and voice granted to Moses was wrought by an angel
because it is so written, but that God appeared and spake in His
own substance to Abraham because there is no mention made of an
angel? What of the fact, that even in respect to Abraham an angel
is not left unmentioned? For when his son was ordered to be offered
up as a sacrifice, we read thus: &#8220;And it came to pass after these
things that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and
he said, Behold, here I am. And He said, Take now thy son, thine
only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of
Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the
mountains that I will tell thee of.&#8221; Certainly God is here
mentioned, not an angel. But a little afterwards Scripture hath it
thus: &#8220;And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife
to slay his son. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of
heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. And he
said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything
unto him.&#8221; What can be answered to this? Will they say that God
commanded that Isaac should be slain, and that an angel forbade it?
and further, that the father himself, in opposition to the decree
of God, who had commanded that he should be slain, obeyed the
angel, who had bidden him spare him? Such an interpretation is to
be rejected as absurd. Yet not even for it, gross and abject as it
is, does Scripture leave any room, for it immediately adds: &#8220;For
now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy
son, thine only son, on account of me.&#8221;<note place="end" n="423" id="iv.i.v.xii-p17.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p18"> <i>Propter me</i></p></note> What is &#8220;on account of me,&#8221;
except on account of Him who had commanded him to be slain? Was
then the God of Abraham the same as the angel, or was it not rather
God by an angel? Consider what follows. Here, certainly, already an
angel has been most clearly spoken of; yet notice the context:
&#8220;And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind
him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and
took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead
of his son. And Abraham called the name of that place, The Lord
saw:<note place="end" n="424" id="iv.i.v.xii-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p19"> <i>Dominus vidit</i></p></note> as it is
said to this day, In the mount the Lord was seen.&#8221;<note place="end" n="425" id="iv.i.v.xii-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p20"> <i>Dominus visus
est</i></p></note> Just as
that <pb n="67" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_67.html" id="iv.i.v.xii-Page_67"/>which a little before God said by an angel, &#8220;For now I
know that thou fearest God;&#8221; not because it was to be understood
that God then came to know, but that He brought it to pass that
through God Abraham himself came to know what strength of heart he
had to obey God, even to the sacrificing of his only son: after
that mode of speech in which the effect is signified by the
efficient,&#8212;as cold is said to be sluggish, because it makes men
sluggish; so that He was therefore said to know, because He had
made Abraham himself to know, who might well have not discerned the
firmness of his own faith, had it not been proved by such a trial.
So here, too, Abraham called the name of the place &#8220;The Lord
saw,&#8221; that is, caused Himself to be seen. For he goes on
immediately to say, &#8220;As it is said to this day, In the mount the
Lord was seen.&#8221; Here you see the same angel is called Lord:
wherefore, unless because the Lord spake by the angel? But if we
pass on to that which follows, the angel altogether speaks as a
prophet, and reveals expressly that God is speaking by the angel.
&#8220;And the angel of the Lord,&#8221; he says, &#8220;called unto Abraham
out of heaven the second time, and said, By myself I have sworn,
saith the Lord; for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not
withheld thy son, thine only son, on account of me,&#8221;<note place="end" n="426" id="iv.i.v.xii-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p21"> <scripRef passage="Gen. 22" id="iv.i.v.xii-p21.1" parsed="|Gen|22|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.22">Gen. xxii</scripRef></p></note> etc.
Certainly these words, <i>viz</i>. that he by whom the Lord speaks
should say, &#8220;Thus saith the Lord,&#8221; are commonly used by the
prophets also. Does the Son of God say of the Father, &#8220;The Lord
saith,&#8221; while He Himself is that Angel of the Father? What then?
Do they not see how hard pressed they are about these three men who
appeared to Abraham, when it had been said before, &#8220;The Lord
appeared to him?&#8221; Were they not angels because they are called
men? Let them read Daniel, saying, &#8220;Behold the man Gabriel.&#8221;<note place="end" n="427" id="iv.i.v.xii-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p22"> <scripRef passage="Dan. ix. 21" id="iv.i.v.xii-p22.2" parsed="|Dan|9|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.9.21">Dan. ix. 21</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.xii-p23">26. But why do we delay any longer
to stop their mouths by another most clear and most weighty proof,
where not an angel in the singular nor men in the plural are spoken
of, but simply angels; by whom not any particular word was wrought,
but the Law itself is most distinctly declared to be given; which
certainly none of the faithful doubts that God gave to Moses for
the control of the children of Israel, or yet, that it was given by
angels. So Stephen speaks: &#8220;Ye stiff-necked,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and
uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy
Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye. Which of the prophets have
not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed
before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the
betrayers and murderers: who have received the Law by the
disposition of angels,<note place="end" n="428" id="iv.i.v.xii-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p24"> <i>In edictis

evident than this? What more strong than such an authority? The
Law, indeed, was given to that people by the disposition of angels;
but the advent of our Lord Jesus Christ was by it prepared and
pre-announced; and He Himself, as the Word of God, was in some
wonderful and unspeakable manner in the angels, by whose

as the divine declarations from the Holy Scriptures have been made
clear, that those words and bodily appearances which were given to
these ancient fathers of ours before the incarnation of the

whether themselves speaking or doing something in the person of
God, as we have shown that the prophets also were wont to do, or
assuming from the creature that which they themselves were not,
wherein God might be shown in a figure to men; which manner of
showing also, Scripture teaches by many examples, that the

The</span>knowledge of things terrestrial and

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.ii-p2">2. But since we are exiled from the
unchangeable joy, yet neither cut off nor torn away from it so that
we should not seek eternity, truth, blessedness, even in those
changeable and temporal things (for we wish neither to die, nor to
be deceived, nor to be troubled); visions have been sent to us from
heaven suitable to our state of pilgrimage, in order to remind us
that what we seek is not here, but that from this pilgrimage we
must return thither, whence unless we originated we should not here
seek these things. And first we have had to be persuaded how much
God loved us, lest from despair we should not dare to look up to
Him. And we needed to be shown also what manner of men we are whom
He loved, lest being proud, as if of our own merits, we should
recede the more from Him, and fail the more in our own strength.
And hence He so dealt with us, that we might the rather profit by
His strength, and that so in the weakness of humility the virtue of
charity might be perfected. And this is intimated in the Psalm,
where it is said, &#8220;Thou, O God, didst send a spontaneous rain,
whereby Thou didst make Thine inheritance perfect, when it was

He gave it, not because we were worthy, but because He willed. And
knowing this, we shall not trust in ourselves; and this is to be
made &#8220;weak.&#8221; But He Himself makes us perfect, who says also to
the Apostle Paul, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for thee, for my

while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then,
being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath

he says, &#8220;shall we then say to these things? If God be for us,

God is One, by which all things were made, which is the
unchangeable truth, all things are simultaneously therein,
potentially and unchangeably; not only those things which are now
in this whole creation, but also those which have been and those
which shall be. And therein they neither have been, nor shall be,
but only <i>are</i>; and all things are life, and all things are
one; or rather it is one being and one life. For all things were so
made by Him, that whatsoever was made in them was not made in Him,
but was life in Him. Since, &#8220;in the beginning,&#8221; the Word was
not made, but &#8220;the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and
all things were made by Him;&#8221; neither had all things been made by
Him, unless He had Himself been before all things and not made. But
in those things which were made by Him, even body, which is not
life, would not have been made by Him, except it had been life in
Him before it was made. For &#8220;that which was made was already life
in Him;&#8221; and not life of any kind soever: for the soul also is
the life of the body, but this too is made, for it is <pb n="71" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_71.html" id="iv.i.vi.ii-Page_71"/>changeable;
and by what was it made, except by the unchangeable Word of God?
For &#8220;all things were made by Him; and without Him was not
anything made that was made.&#8221; &#8220;What, therefore, was made was
already life in Him;&#8221; and not any kind of life, but &#8220;the life
[which] was the light of men;&#8221; the light certainly of rational
minds, by which men differ from beasts, and therefore are men.
Therefore not corporeal light, which is the light of the flesh,
whether it shine from heaven, or whether it be lighted by earthly
fires; nor that of human flesh only, but also that of beasts, and
down even to the minutest of worms. For all these things see that
light: but that life was the light of men; nor is it far from any

of the Word, namely, of that life which is the light of men. But
for this partaking we were utterly unfit, and fell short of it, on
account of the uncleanness of sins. Therefore we were to be

might be cleansed through Him, made as He was what we are by
nature, and what we are not by sin, that we might contemplate God,
which by nature we are not. For by nature we are not God: by nature
we are men, by sin we are not righteous. Wherefore God, made a
righteous man, interceded with God for man the sinner. For the
sinner is not congruous to the righteous, but man is congruous to
man. By joining therefore to us the likeness of His humanity, He
took away the unlikeness of our unrighteousness; and by being made
partaker of our mortality, He made us partakers of His divinity.
For the death of the sinner springing from the necessity of
comdemnation is deservedly abolished by the death of the Righteous
One springing from the free choice of His compassion, while His
single [death and resurrection] answers to our double [death and
resurrection].<note place="end" n="449" id="iv.i.vi.iii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.iii-p4"> [This singleness and doubleness is

this is not the place to set forth the power of that consonance of
single to double which is found especially in us, and which is
naturally so implanted in us (and by whom, except by Him who
created us?), that not even the ignorant can fail to perceive it,
whether when singing themselves or hearing others. For by this it
is that treble and bass voices are in harmony, so that any one who
in his note departs from it, offends extremely, not only trained
skill, of which the most part of men are devoid, but the very sense
of hearing. To demonstrate this, needs no doubt a long discourse;
but any one who knows it, may make it plain to the very ear in a
rightly ordered monochord.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.iv-p2">5. But for our present need we must
discuss, so far as God gives us power, in what manner the single of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ answers to, and is, so to say, in
harmony with our double to the effect of salvation. We certainly,
as no Christian doubts, are dead both in soul and body: in soul,
because of sin; in body, because of the punishment of sin, and
through this also in body because of sin. And to both these parts
of ourselves, that is, both to soul and to body, there was need
both of a medicine and of resurrection, that what had been changed
for the worse might be renewed for the better. Now the death of the
soul is ungodliness, and the death of the body is corruptibility,
through which comes also a departure of the soul from the body. For
as the soul dies when God leaves it, so the body dies when the soul
leaves it; whereby the former becomes foolish, the latter lifeless.
For the soul is raised up again by repentance, and the renewing of
life is begun in the body still mortal by faith, by which men

of ours our Saviour bestowed His own single death; and to cause
both our resurrections, He appointed beforehand and set forth in
mystery and type His own one resurrection. For He was not a sinner
or ungodly, that, as though dead in spirit, He should need to be
renewed in the inner man, and to be recalled as it were to the life
of righteousness by repentance; but being clothed in mortal flesh,
and in that alone dying, in that alone rising again, in that alone
did He answer to both for us; since in it was wrought a mystery as
regards the inner man, and a type as regards the outer. For it was
in a mystery as regards our inner man, so as to signify the death
of our soul, that those words were uttered, not only in the Psalm,

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.v-p2">7. Now this ratio of the single to
the double arises, no doubt, from the ternary number, since one
added to two makes three; but the whole which these make reaches to
the senary, for one and two and three make six. And this number is
on that account called perfect, because it is completed in its own
parts: for it has these three, sixth, third, and half; nor is there
any other part found in it, which we can call an aliquot part. The
sixth part of it, then, is one; the third part, two; the half,
three. But one and two and three complete the same six. And Holy
Scripture commends to us the perfection of this number, especially
in this, that God finished His works in six days, and on the sixth
day man was made in the image of God.<note place="end" n="479" id="iv.i.vi.v-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.v-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. i. 27" id="iv.i.vi.v-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|1|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.27">Gen. i. 27</scripRef></p></note> And the Son of God came and was
made the Son of man, that He might re-create us after the image of
God, in the sixth age of the human race. For that is now the
present age, whether a thousand years apiece are assigned to each
age, or whether we trace out memorable and remarkable epochs or
turning-points of time in the divine Scriptures, so that the first
age is to be found from Adam until Noah, and the second thence
onwards to Abraham, and then next, after the division of Matthew
the evangelist, from Abraham to David, from David to the carrying
away to Babylon, and from thence to the travail of the Virgin,<note place="end" n="480" id="iv.i.vi.v-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.v-p4"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 1.17" id="iv.i.vi.v-p4.1" parsed="|Matt|1|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.1.17">Matt. i. 17</scripRef></p></note> which three
ages joined to those other two make five. Accordingly, the nativity
of the Lord began the sixth, which is now going onwards until the
hidden end of time. We recognize also in this senary number a kind
of figure of time, in that threefold mode of division, by which we
compute one portion of time before the Law; a second, under the
Law; a third, under grace. In which last time we have received the
sacrament of renewal, that we may be renewed also in the end of
time, in every part, by the resurrection of the flesh, and so may
be made whole from our entire infirmity, not only of soul, but also
of body. And thence that woman is understood to be a type of the
church, who was made whole and upright by the Lord, after she had
been bowed by infirmity through the binding of Satan. For those
words of the Psalm lament such hidden enemies: &#8220;They bowed down

the third year of its miserable barrenness. But intercession was
made for it, that it might be let alone that year, that year, that

six.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.v-p7">8. A single year also, if the whole
twelve months are taken into account, which are made up of thirty
days each (for the month that has been kept from of old is that
which the revolution of the moon determines), abounds in the number
six. For that which six is, in the first order of numbers, which
consists of units up to ten, that sixty is in the second order,
which consists of tens up to a hundred. Sixty days, then, are a
sixth part of the year. Further, if that which stands as the sixth
of the second order is multiplied by the sixth of the first order,
then we make six times sixty, <i>i.e.</i> three hundred and sixty
days, which are the whole twelve months. But since, as the
revolution of the moon determines the month for men, so the year is
marked by the revolution of the sun; and five days and a quarter of
a day remain, that the sun may fulfill its course and end the year;
for four quarters make one day, which must be intercalated in every
fourth year, which they call bissextile, that the order of time may
not be disturbed: if we consider, also, these five days and a
quarter themselves, the number six prevails in them. First,
because, as it is usual to compute the whole from a part, we must
not call it five days, but rather six, taking the quarter days for
one day. Next, because five days themselves are the sixth part of a
month; while the quarter of a day contains six hours. For the
entire day, <i>i.e.</i> including its night, is twenty-four hours,
of which the fourth part, which is a quarter of a day, is found to
be six hours. So much in the course of the year does the sixth
number prevail.</p>

itself of the body of the Lord is found to have been brought in so
many days to the birth, as the authority of the church maintains
upon the tradition of the elders. For He is believed to have been
conceived on the 25th of March, upon which day also He suffered; so

the space of those three days themselves was not whole and entire,
but the first day is counted as a whole from its last part, and the
third day is itself also counted as a whole from its first part;
but the intervening day, <i>i.e.</i> the second day, was absolutely
a whole with its twenty-four hours, twelve of the day and twelve of
the night. For He was crucified first by the voices of the Jews in
the third hour, when it was the sixth day of the week. Then He hung
on the cross itself at the sixth hour, and yielded up His spirit at
the ninth hour.<note place="end" n="487" id="iv.i.vi.vii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.vii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 27.23-50" id="iv.i.vi.vii-p3.1" parsed="|Matt|27|23|27|50" osisRef="Bible:Matt.27.23-Matt.27.50">Matt. xxvii.

understand that He was suspended on the cross at the third
hour,&#8212;still you cannot make the first day an entire day. It will
be reckoned then an entire day from its last part, as the third
from its first part. For the night up to the dawn, when the
resurrection of the Lord was made known, belongs to the third day;
because God (who commanded <pb n="75" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_75.html" id="iv.i.vi.vii-Page_75"/>the light to shine out of

to us in some way that the day takes its beginning from the night.
For as the first days of all were reckoned from light to night, on
account of the future fall of man;<note place="end" n="492" id="iv.i.vi.vii-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.vii-p8"> <scripRef passage="Gen. i. 4, 5" id="iv.i.vi.vii-p8.2" parsed="|Gen|1|4|1|5" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.4-Gen.1.5">Gen. i. 4, 5</scripRef></p></note> so these on account of the
restoration of man, are reckoned from darkness to light. From the
hour, then, of His death to the dawn of the resurrection are forty
hours, counting in also the ninth hour itself. And with this number
agrees also His life upon earth of forty days after His
resurrection. And this number is most frequently used in Scripture
to express the mystery of perfection in the fourfold world. For the
number ten has a certain perfection, and that multiplied by four
makes forty. But from the evening of the burial to the dawn of the
resurrection are thirty-six hours which is six squared. And this is
referred to that ratio of the single to the double wherein there is
the greatest consonance of co-adaptation. For twelve added to
twenty-four suits the ratio of single added to double and makes
thirty-six: namely a whole night with a whole day and a whole
night, and this not without the mystery which I have noticed above.
For not unfitly do we liken the spirit to the day and the body to
the night. For the body of the Lord in His death and resurrection
was a figure of our spirit and a type of our body. In this way,
then, also that ratio of the single to the double is apparent in
the thirty-six hours, when twelve are added to twenty-four. As to
the reasons, indeed, why these numbers are so put in the Holy
Scriptures, other people may trace out other reasons, either such
that those which I have given are to be preferred to them, or such
as are equally probable with mine, or even more probable than they
are; but there is no one surely so foolish or so absurd as to
contend that they are so put in the Scriptures for no purpose at
all, and that there are no mystical reasons why those numbers are
there mentioned. But those reasons which I have here given, I have
either gathered from the authority of the church, according to the
tradition of our forefathers, or from the testimony of the divine
Scriptures, or from the nature itself of numbers and of
similitudes. No sober person will decide against reason, no
Christian against the Scriptures, no peaceable person against the
church.</p>

by the fathers themselves, were similitudes; in order that every
creature by its acts might speak in some way of that One who was to
be, in whom there was to be salvation in the recovery of all from
death. For because by the wickedness of ungodliness we had recoiled
and fallen away in discord from the one true and supreme God, and
had in many things become vain, being distracted through many
things and cleaving fast to many things; it was needful, by the
decree and command of God in His mercy, that those same many things
should join in proclaiming the One that should come, and that One
should come so proclaimed by these many things, and that these many
things should join in witnessing that this One had come; and that
so, freed from the burden of these many things, we should come to
that One, and dead as we were in our souls by many sins, and
destined to die in the flesh on account of sin, that we should love
that One who, without sin, died in the flesh for us; and by
believing in Him now raised again, and by rising again with Him in
the spirit through faith, that we should be justified by being made
one in the one righteous One; and that we should not despair of our
own resurrection in the flesh itself, when we consider that the one
Head had gone before us the many members; in whom, being now
cleansed through faith, and then renewed by sight, and through Him
as mediator reconciled to God, we are to cleave to the One, to
feast upon the One, to continue one.</p>

exhibit to men so great marvels in theatrical spectacles, that they
who never saw such things scarcely believe them when told; why
should it be hard for the devil and his angels to make out of
corporeal elements, through their own aerial bodies, things at

fantastic appearances to the deluding of men&#8217;s senses, whereby to
deceive them, whether awake or asleep, or to drive them into
frenzy? But just as it may happen that one who is better than they
in life and character may gaze at the most worthless of men, either
walking on a rope, or doing by various motions of the body many
things difficult of belief, and yet he may not at all desire to do
such things, nor think those men on that account to be preferred to

condition of humanity cannot now be escaped, but rather
ungodliness, which can be guarded against through faith, meets us
at the end to which we have come, but not by the way by which we
came. For we, indeed, came to death through sin; He through
righteousness: and, therefore, as our death is the punishment of
sin, so His death was made a sacrifice for sin.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p2">16. Wherefore, since the spirit is
to be preferred to the body, and the death of the spirit means that
God has left it, but the death of the body that the spirit has left
it; and since herein lies the punishment in the death of the body,
that the spirit leaves the body against its will, because it left
God willingly; so that, whereas the spirit left God because it
would, it leaves the body although it would not; nor leaves it when
it would, unless it has offered violence to itself, whereby the
body itself is slain: the spirit of the Mediator showed how it was
through no punishment of sin that He came to the death of the
flesh, because He did not leave it against His will, but because He
willed, when He willed, as He willed. For because He is so
commingled [with the flesh] by the Word of God as to be one, He
says: &#8220;I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take
it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay down my life that I
might take it again.&#8221;<note place="end" n="510" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p3"> <scripRef passage="John x. 17, 18" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p3.2" parsed="|John|10|17|10|18" osisRef="Bible:John.10.17-John.10.18">John x. 17, 18</scripRef></p></note> And, as the Gospel tells us, they

immediately gave up His spirit. For they who are hung on the cross
are commonly tortured by a prolonged death. Whence it was that the
legs of the thieves were broken, in order that they might die
directly, and be taken down from the cross before the Sabbath. And
that He was found to be dead already, caused wonder. And it was

then,&#8212;who was a mediator to death for man, and feignedly puts
himself forward as to life, under the name of cleansing by
sacrilegious rites and sacrifices, by which the proud are led
away,&#8212;can neither share in our death, nor rise again from his
own: he has indeed been able to apply his single death to our
double one; but he certainly has not been able to apply a single
resurrection, which should be at once a mystery of our renewal, and
a type of that waking up which is to be in the end. He then who
being alive in the spirit raised again His own flesh that was dead,
the true Mediator of life, has cast out him, who is dead in the
spirit and the mediator of death, from the spirits of those who
believe in Himself, so that he should not reign within, but should
assault from without, and yet not prevail. And to him, too, He
offered Himself to be tempted, in order that He might be also a
mediator to overcome his temptations, not only by succor, but also
by example. But when the devil, from the first, although striving
through every entrance to creep into His inward parts, was thrust
out, having finished all his alluring temptation in the wilderness
after the baptism;<note place="end" n="512" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p6"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 4.1-11" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p6.1" parsed="|Matt|4|1|4|11" osisRef="Bible:Matt.4.1-Matt.4.11">Matt. iv. 1&#8211;11</scripRef></p></note> because, being dead in the spirit,
he forced no entrance into Him who was alive in the spirit, he
betook himself, through eagerness for the death of man in any way
whatsoever, to effecting that death which he could, and was
permitted to effect it upon that mortal element which the living
Mediator had received from us. And where he could do anything,
there in every respect he was conquered; and wherein he received
outwardly the power of slaying the Lord in the flesh, therein his
inward power, by which he held ourselves, was slain. For it was
brought to pass that the bonds of many sins in many deaths were
loosed, through the one death of One which no sin had preceded.
Which death, though not due, the Lord therefore rendered for us,
that the death which was due might work us no hurt. For He was not
stripped of the flesh by obligation of any authority, but He
stripped Himself. For doubtless He who was able not to die, if He
would not, did die because He would: and so He made a show of
principalities and powers, openly triumphing over them in
Himself.<note place="end" n="513" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p6.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p7"> <scripRef passage="Col. ii. 15" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p7.2" parsed="|Col|2|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.2.15">Col. ii. 15</scripRef></p></note> For whereas
by His death the one and most real sacrifice was offered up for us,
whatever fault there was, whence principalities and powers held us

death of the flesh, lost man, whom he was possessing as by an
absolute right, seduced as he was by his own consent, and over whom
he ruled, himself impeded by no corruption of flesh and blood,
through that frailty of man&#8217;s mortal body, whence he was both too
poor and too weak; he who was proud in proportion as he was, as it
were, both richer and stronger, ruling over him who was, as it
were, both clothed in rags and full of troubles. For whither he
drove the sinner to fall, himself not following, there by following
he compelled the Redeemer to descend. And so the Son of God deigned
to become our friend in the fellowship of death, to which because
he came not, the enemy thought himself to be better and greater
than ourselves. For our Redeemer says, &#8220;Greater love hath no man

those who are his own until this very day, to whom he presents
himself as a false mediator, as though they would be cleansed or

persuades the proud to ridicule and despise the death of Christ,
from which the more he himself is estranged, the more is he
believed by them to be the holier and more divine. Yet those who
have remained with him are very few, since the nations acknowledge
and with pious humility imbibe the price paid for themselves, and
in trust upon it abandon their enemy, and gather together to their
Redeemer. For the devil does not know how the most excellent wisdom
of God makes use of both his snares and his fury to bring about the
salvation of His own faithful ones, beginning from the former end,
which is the beginning of the spiritual creature, even to the
latter end, which is the death of the body, and so &#8220;reaching from
the one end to the other, mightily and sweetly ordering all
things.&#8221;<note place="end" n="518" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p13"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. viii. 1" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p13.2" parsed="|Wis|8|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.8.1">Wisd. viii. 1</scripRef></p></note> For wisdom

do with the death of the flesh, whence comes his exceeding pride, a
death of another kind is prepared in the eternal fire of hell, by
which not only the spirits that have earthly, but also those who

is despised, because He died, wherein He bought us with so great a
price,<note place="end" n="520" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p14.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p15"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 20" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p15.2" parsed="|1Cor|6|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.20">1 Cor. vi. 20</scripRef></p></note> both bring
back the former death, and also men, to that miserable condition of
nature, which is derived from the first sin, and will be cast down
into the latter death with the devil. And they on this account
preferred the devil to Christ, because the former cast them into
that former death, whither he himself fell not through the
difference of his nature, and whither on account of them Christ
descended through His great mercy: and yet they do not hesitate to
believe themselves better than the devils, and do not cease to
assail and denounce them with every sort of malediction, while they
know them at any rate to have nothing to do with the suffering of
this kind of death, on account of which they despise Christ.
Neither will they take into account that the case may possibly be,
that the Word of God, remaining in Himself, and in Himself in no
way changeable, may yet, through the taking upon Him of a lower
nature, be able to suffer somewhat of a lower kind, which the
unclean spirit cannot suffer, because he has not an earthly body.
And so, whereas they themselves are better than the devils, yet,
because they bear a body of flesh, they can so die, as the devils
certainly cannot die, who do not bear such a body. They presume
much on the deaths of their own sacrifices, which they do not
perceive that they sacrifice to deceitful and proud spirits; or if
they have come to perceive it, think their friendship to be of some
good to themselves, treacherous and envious although they are,
whose purpose is bent upon nothing else except to hinder our
return.</p>

they therefore able to see clearly in the matter of this science

what are the seeds of each in their beginnings, what measure in
their increase, what numbers run through their conceptions, births,
ages, settings; what motions in desiring things according to their
nature, and in avoiding the contrary? Have they not sought out all
these things, not through that unchangeable wisdom, but through the
actual history of places and times, or have trusted the written
experience of others? Wherefore it is the less to be wondered at,

the acuteness of the sense of those who see them, by doing which
the aerial powers are thought to divine (just as if a person from

to announce it beforehand to those who dwelt close by in the

already and were always, but here were about to be so that as yet
they were not; or, again, to see therein those changes for the
better, not of the souls only, but also of the bodies of men, even
to the perfection of their proper measure; whereas then, I say,
they were in no way fit to see these things therein, they were not
even judged worthy of receiving any announcement of them by the
holy angels; whether externally through the senses of the body, or
by interior revelations exhibited in the spirit; as these things
actually were manifested to our fathers, who were gifted with true
piety, and who by foretelling them, obtaining credence either by

remotely future, even to the end of the world. But the proud and
deceitful powers of the air, even if they are found to have said

might sound abroad from all sides, to aid the faithful, to be a
witness against the ungodly.</p>

Became Incarnate in Order that We Being Cleansed by Faith May Be
Raised to the Unchangeable Truth.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.xix-p2">24. Since, then, we were not fit to
take hold of things eternal, and since the foulness of sins weighed
us down, which we had contracted by the love of temporal things,
and which were implanted in us as it were naturally, from the root
of mortality, it was needful that we should be cleansed. But
cleansed we could not be, so as to be tempered together with things
eternal, except it were through things temporal, wherewith we were
already tempered together and held fast. For health is at the
opposite extreme from disease; but the intermediate process of
healing does not lead us to perfect health, unless it has some
congruity with the disease. Things temporal that are useless merely
deceive the sick; things temporal that are useful take up those
that need healing, and pass them on healed, to things eternal. And
the rational mind, as when cleansed it owes contemplation to things
eternal; so, when needing cleansing, owes faith to things temporal.
One even of those who were formerly esteemed wise men among the
Greeks has said, The truth stands to faith in the same relation in
which eternity stands to that which has a beginning. And he is no
doubt right in saying so. For what we call temporal, he describes
as having had a beginning. And we also ourselves come under this
kind, not only in respect to the body, but also in respect to the
changeableness of the soul. For that is not properly called eternal
which undergoes any degree of change. Therefore, in so far as we
are changeable, in so far we stand apart from eternity. But life
eternal is promised to us through the truth, from the clear
knowledge of which, again, our faith stands as far apart as
mortality does from eternity. We then now put faith in things done
in time on our account, and by that faith itself we are cleansed;
in order that when we have come to sight, as truth follows faith,
so eternity may follow upon mortality. And therefore, since our
faith will become truth, when we have attained to that which is
promised to us who believe: and that which is promised us is
eternal life; and the Truth (not that which shall come to be
according as our faith shall be, but that truth which is always,
because in it is eternity,&#8212;the Truth then) has said, &#8220;And this
is life eternal, that <pb n="82" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_82.html" id="iv.i.vi.xix-Page_82"/>they might know Thee the only

faith by seeing shall come to be truth, then eternity shall possess
our now changed mortality. And until this shall take place, and in
order that it may take place,&#8212;because we adapt the faith of
belief to things which have a beginning, as in things eternal we
hope for the truth of contemplation, lest the faith of mortal life
should be at discord with the truth of eternal life,&#8212;the Truth
itself, co-eternal with the Father, took a beginning from earth,<note place="end" n="529" id="iv.i.vi.xix-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.xix-p4"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lxxxv. 11" id="iv.i.vi.xix-p4.2" parsed="|Ps|85|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.85.11">Ps. lxxxv. 11</scripRef></p></note> when the Son
of God so came as to become the Son of man, and to take to Himself
our faith, that He might thereby lead us on to His own truth, who
so undertook our mortality, as not to lose His own eternity. For
truth stands to faith in the relation in which eternity stands to
that which has a beginning. Therefore, we must needs so be
cleansed, that we may come to have such a beginning as remains
eternal, that we may not have one beginning in faith, and another
in truth. Neither could we pass to things eternal from the
condition of having a beginning, unless we were transferred, by
union of the eternal to ourselves through our own beginning, to His
own eternity. Therefore our faith has, in some measure, now
followed thither, whither He in whom we have believed has ascended;
born,<note place="end" n="530" id="iv.i.vi.xix-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.xix-p5"> Ortus.</p></note> dead, risen
again, taken up. Of these four things, we knew the first two in
ourselves. For we know that men both have a beginning and die. But
the remaining two, that is, to be raised, and to be taken up, we
rightly hope will be in us, because we have believed them done in
Him. Since, therefore, in Him that, too, which had a beginning has
passed over to eternity, in ourselves also it will so pass over,
when faith shall have arrived at truth. For to those who thus
believe, in order that they might remain in the word of faith, and
being thence led on to the truth, and through that to eternity,
might be freed from death, He speaks thus: &#8220;If ye continue in my
word, then are ye my disciples indeed.&#8221; And as though they would
ask, With what fruit? He proceeds to say, &#8220;And ye shall know the
truth.&#8221; And again, as though they would say, Of what good is
truth to mortal men? &#8220;And the truth,&#8221; He says, &#8220;shall make
you free.&#8221;<note place="end" n="531" id="iv.i.vi.xix-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.xix-p6"> <scripRef passage="John viii. 31, 32" id="iv.i.vi.xix-p6.2" parsed="|John|8|31|8|32" osisRef="Bible:John.8.31-John.8.32">John viii. 31, 32</scripRef></p></note> From what,

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.xx-p2">25. Behold, then, why the Son of
God was sent; nay, rather behold what it is for the Son of God to
be sent. Whatever things they were which were wrought in time, with
a view to produce faith, whereby we might be cleansed so as to
contemplate truth, in things that have a beginning, which have been
put forth from eternity, and are referred back to eternity: these
were either testimonies of this mission, or they were the mission
itself of the Son of God. But some of these testimonies announced
Him beforehand as to come, some testified that He had come already.
For that He was made a creature by whom the whole creation was
made, must needs find a witness in the whole creation. For except
one were preached by the sending of many [witnesses] one would not
be bound to, the sending away of many. And unless there were such
testimonies as should seem to be great to those who are lowly, it
would not be believed, that He being great should make men great,
who as lowly was sent to the lowly. For the heaven and the earth
and all things in them are incomparably greater works of the Son of
God, since all things were made by Him, than the signs and the
portents which broke forth in testimony of Him. But yet men, in
order that, being lowly, they might believe these great things to
have been wrought by Him, trembled at those lowly things, as if
they had been great.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.xx-p3">26. &#8220;When, therefore, the

therefore, the greater sends the less, we too, acknowledge Him to
have been made less; and in so far less, in so far as made; and in
so far made, in so far as sent. For &#8220;He sent forth His Son made
of a woman.&#8221; And yet, because all things were made by Him, not
only before He was made and sent, but before all things were at
all, we confess the same to be equal to the sender, whom we call
less, as having been sent. In what way, then, could He be seen by
the fathers, when certain angelical visions were shown to them,
before that fullness of time at which it was fitting He should be
sent, and so before He was sent, at a time when not yet sent He was
seen as He is equal with the Father? For

hath seen me, hath seen the Father also;&#8221; unless because He was

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.xxi-p2">27. But if the Son is said to be
sent by the Father on this account, that the one is the Father, and
the other the Son, this does not in any manner hinder us from
believing the Son to be equal, and consubstantial, and co-eternal
with the Father, and yet to have been sent as Son by the Father.
Not because the one is greater, the other less; but because the one
is Father, the other Son; the one begetter, the other begotten; the
one, He from whom He is who is sent; the other, He who is from Him
who sends. For the Son is from the Father, not the Father from the
Son. And according to this manner we can now understand that the
Son is not only said to have been sent because &#8220;the Word was made
flesh,&#8221;<note place="end" n="534" id="iv.i.vi.xxi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.xxi-p3"> <scripRef passage="John i. 3, 18, 14" id="iv.i.vi.xxi-p3.2" parsed="|John|1|3|0|0;|John|1|18|0|0;|John|1|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.3 Bible:John.1.18 Bible:John.1.14">John i. 3, 18, 14</scripRef></p></note> but
therefore sent that the Word might be made flesh, and that He might
perform through His bodily presence those things which were
written; that is, that not only is He understood to have been sent
as man, which the Word was made but the Word, too, was sent that it
might be made man; because He was not sent in respect to any
inequality of power, or substance, or anything that in Him was not
equal to the Father; but in respect to this, that the Son is from
the Father, not the Father from the Son; for the Son is the Word of
the Father, which is also called His wisdom. What wonder,
therefore, if He is sent, not because He is unequal with the
Father, but because He is &#8220;a pure emanation (<i>manatio</i>)
issuing from the glory of the Almighty God?&#8221; For there, that
which issues, and that from which it issues, is of one and the same
substance. For it does not issue as water issues from an aperture
of earth or of stone, but as light issues from light. For the
words, &#8220;For she is the brightness of the everlasting light,&#8221;
what else are they than, she is light of everlasting light? For
what is the brightness of light, except light itself? and so
co-eternal, with the light, from which the light is. But it is
preferable to say, &#8220;the brightness of light,&#8221; rather than&#8221;
the light of light;&#8221; lest that which issues should be thought to
be darker than that from which it issues. For when one hears of the
brightness of light as being light itself, it is more easy to
believe that the former shines by means of the latter, than that
the latter shines less. But because there was no need of warning
men not to think that light to be less, which begat the other (for
no heretic ever dared say this, neither is it to be believed that
any one will dare to do so), Scripture meets that other thought,
whereby that light which issues might seem darker than that from
which it issues; and it has removed this surmise by saying, &#8220;It
is the brightness of that light,&#8221; namely, of eternal light, and
so shows it to be equal. For if it were less, then it would be its
darkness, not its brightness; but if it were greater, then it could
not issue from it, for it could not surpass that from which it is
educed. Therefore, because it issues from it, it is not greater
than it is; and because it is not its darkness, but its brightness,
it is not less than it is: therefore it is equal. Nor ought this to
trouble us, that it is called a pure emanation issuing from the
glory of the Almighty God, as if itself were not omnipotent, but an
emanation from the Omnipotent; for soon after it is said of it,
&#8220;And being but one, she can do all things.&#8221;<note place="end" n="535" id="iv.i.vi.xxi-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.xxi-p4"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. vii. 25-27" id="iv.i.vi.xxi-p4.2" parsed="|Wis|7|25|7|27" osisRef="Bible:Wis.7.25-Wis.7.27">Wisd. vii. 25&#8211;27</scripRef></p></note> But who is omnipotent, unless He

be the salvation of those wise and holy men also, who, before He

employed &#8220;relatively, and not according to substance,&#8221; as
Augustin says. The Father is &#8220;the beginning of the whole
deity,&#8221; with reference to the personal distinctions of Father,
Son, and Spirit&#8212;the Son being from the Father, and the Spirit
from Father and Son. The trinitarian relations or modes of the
essence, &#8220;begin&#8221; with the first person, not the second or the
third. The phrase &#8220;whole deity,&#8221; in the above statement, is put
for &#8220;trinity,&#8221; not for &#8220;essence.&#8221; Augustin would not say
that the Father is the &#8220;beginning&#8221; (<i>principium</i>) of the
divine essence considered abstractly, but only of the essence as
<i>trinal</i>. In this sense, Trinitarian writers denominate the
Father &#8220;<i>fons trinitatis,</i>&#8221; and sometimes &#8220;<i>fons
deitatis</i>.&#8221; Turrettin employs this latter phraseology (iii.
xxx. i. 8); so does Owen (<i>Communion with Trinity</i>, Ch. iii.);
and Hooker (<i>Polity</i>, v. liv.). But in this case, the guarding
clause of Turretin is to be subjoined: &#8220;<i>fons deitatis, si

trinitatis</i>,&#8221; or &#8220;<i>principium trinitatis</i>,&#8221; is less

the Scripture plainly says, and shows in many places, that they

plain by visible signs, in order to show that the whole world, and
all nations constituted with different tongues, should believe in
Christ through the gift of the Holy Spirit, to fulfill that which
is sung in the Psalm, &#8220;There is no speech nor language where

dare to say that nothing of the kind was done aforetime. But I
would boldly say, that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, of one and
the same substance, God the Creator, the Omnipotent Trinity, work
indivisibly; but that this cannot be indivisibly manifested by the
creature, which is far inferior, and least of all by the bodily
creature: just as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit cannot be named
by our words, which certainly are bodily sounds, except in their
own proper intervals of time, divided by a distinct separation,
which intervals the proper syllables of each word occupy. Since in
their proper substance wherein they are, the three are one, the
Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, the very same, by no
temporal motion, above the whole creature, without any interval of
time and place, and at once one and the same from eternity to
eternity, as it were eternity itself, which is not without
truth <pb n="86" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_86.html" id="iv.i.vi.xxii-Page_86"/>and charity. But, in my words, the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit are separated, and cannot be named at once, and occupy their
own proper places separately invisible letters. And as, when I name
my memory, and intellect, and will, each name refers to each
severally, but yet each is uttered by all three; for there is no
one of these three names that is not uttered by both my memory and
my intellect and my will together [by the soul as a whole]; so the
Trinity together wrought both the voice of the Father, and the
flesh of the Son, and the dove of the Holy Spirit, while each of
these things is referred severally to each person. And by this
similitude it is in some degree discernible, that the Trinity,
which is inseparable in itself, is manifested separably by the
appearance of the visible creature; and that the operation of the
Trinity is also inseparable in each severally of those things which
are said to pertain properly to the manifesting of either the
Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.xxii-p6">31. If then I am asked, in what
manner either words or sensible forms and appearances were wrought
before the incarnation of the Word of God, which should prefigure
it as about to come, I reply that God wrought those things by the
angels; and this I have also shown sufficiently, as I think, by
testimonies of the Holy Scriptures. And if I am asked how the
incarnation itself was brought to pass, I reply that the Word of
God itself was made flesh, that is, was made man, yet not turned
and changed into that which was made; but so made, that there
should be there not only the Word of God and the flesh of man, but
also the rational soul of man, and that this whole should both be
called God on account of God, and man on account of man. And if
this is understood with difficulty, the mind must be purged by
faith, by more and more abstaining from sins, and by doing good
works, and by praying with the groaning of holy desires; that by
profiting through the divine help, it may both understand and love.
And if I am asked, how, after the incarnation of the Word, either a
voice of the Father was produced, or a corporeal appearance by
which the Holy Spirit was manifested: I do not doubt indeed that
this was done through the creature; but whether only corporeal and
sensible, or whether by the employment also of the spirit rational
or intellectual (for this is the term by which some choose to call
what the Greeks name 
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.vi.xxii-p6.1">&#957;&#959;&#949;&#961;&#8057;&#957;</span>), not certainly so as
to form one person (for who could possibly say that whatever
creature it was by which the voice of the Father sounded, is in
such sense God the Father; or whatever creature it was by which the
Holy Spirit was manifested in the form of a dove, or in fiery
tongues, is in such sense the Holy Spirit, as the Son of God is
that man who was made of a virgin?), but only to the ministry of
bringing about such intimations as God judged needful; or whether
anything else is to be understood: is difficult to discover, and
not expedient rashly to affirm. Yet I see not how those things
could have been brought to pass without the rational or
intellectual creature. But it is not yet the proper place to
explain, as the Lord may give me strength, why I so think; for the
arguments of heretics must first be discussed and refuted, which
they do not produce from the divine books, but from their own
reasons, and by which, as they think, they forcibly compel us so to
understand the testimonies of the Scriptures which treat of the
Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, as they themselves
will.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.xxii-p7">32. But now, as I think, it has
been sufficiently shown, that the Son is not therefore less because
He is sent by the Father, nor the Holy Spirit less because both the
Father sent Him and the Son. For these things are perceived to be
laid down in the Scriptures, either on account of the visible
creature; or rather on account of commending to our thoughts the
emanation [within the Godhead];<note place="end" n="563" id="iv.i.vi.xxii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.xxii-p8"> [The original is: &#8220;<i>propter
principii commendationem</i>,&#8221; which the English translator
renders &#8220;On account of commending to our thoughts the principle
[of the Godhead].&#8221; The technical use of &#8220;principium&#8221; is
missed. Augustin says that the phrases, &#8220;sending the Son,&#8221; and
&#8220;sending the Spirit,&#8221; have reference to the &#8220;visible
creature&#8221; through which in the theophanies each was manifested;
but still more, to the fact that the Father is the &#8220;beginning&#8221;
of the Son, and the Father and Son are the &#8220;beginning&#8221; of the
Spirit. This fact of a &#8220;beginning,&#8221; or emanation
(<i>manatio</i>) of one from another, is what is commended to our
thoughts.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> but not on account of inequality,
or imparity, or unlikeness of substance; since, even if God the
Father had willed to appear visibly through the subject creature,
yet it would be most absurd to say that He was sent either by the
Son, whom He begot, or by the Holy Spirit, who proceeds from Him.
Let this, therefore, be the limit of the present book. Henceforth
in the rest we shall see, the Lord helping, of what sort are those
crafty arguments of the heretics, and in what manner they may be
confuted.</p>

God is, in their opinion, predicated of Him according to substance;
and therefore it follows, that to beget and to be begotten, or to
be begotten and unbegotten, being diverse, are diverse substances;
whereas it is here demonstrated that not everything predicated of
God is predicated according to substance, in such manner as He is
called good and great according to substance, or anything else that
is predicated of Him in respect to Himself; but that some things
are also predicated of Him relatively, i.e. not in respect to
Himself, but to something not Himself, as He is called Father in
respect to the Son, and Lord in respect to the creature that
serveth Him; in which case, if anything thus predicated relatively,
i.e. in respect to something not Himself, is even predicated as
happening in time, as e.g. &#8220;Lord, thou hast become our refuge,&#8221;
yet nothing happens to God so as to work a change in Him, but He
Himself remains absolutely unchangeable in His own nature or

they may perceive me to have had the desire rather than the power
to speak, what they either understand better themselves, or fail to
understand through the obscurity of my language, just as I myself
pardon them what they cannot understand through their own

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vii.i-p5">2. And we shall mutually pardon one
another the more easily, if we know, or at any rate firmly believe
and hold, that whatever is said of a nature, unchangeable,
invisible and having life absolutely and sufficient to itself, must
not be measured after the custom of things visible, and changeable,
and mortal, or not self-sufficient. But although we labor, and yet
fail, to grasp and know even those things which are within the
scope of our corporeal senses, or what we are ourselves in the
inner man; yet it is with no shamelessness that faithful piety
burns after those divine and unspeakable things which are above:
piety, I say, not inflated by the arrogance of its own power, but
inflamed by the grace of <pb n="88" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_88.html" id="iv.i.vii.i-Page_88"/>its Creator and Saviour Himself.
For with what understanding can man apprehend God, who does not yet
apprehend that very understanding itself of his own, by which he
desires to apprehend Him? And if he does already apprehend this,
let him carefully consider that there is nothing in his own nature
better than it; and let him see whether he can there see any
outlines of forms, or brightness of colors, or greatness of space,
or distance of parts, or extension of size, or any movements
through intervals of place, or any such thing at all. Certainly we
find nothing of all this in that, than which we find nothing better
in our own nature, that is, in our own intellect, by which we
apprehend wisdom according to our capacity. What, therefore, we do
not find in that which is our own best, we ought not to seek in Him
who is far better than that best of ours; that so we may understand
God, if we are able, and as much as we are able, as good without
quality, great without quantity, a creator though He lack nothing,
ruling but from no position, sustaining all things without
&#8220;having&#8221; them, in His wholeness everywhere, yet without place,
eternal without time, making things that are changeable, without
change of Himself, and without passion. Whoso thus thinks of God,
although he cannot yet find out in all ways what He is, yet piously
takes heed, as much as he is able, to think nothing of Him that He
is not.</p>

this, as their most crafty device, namely, that whatsoever is said
or understood of God, is said not according to accident, but
according to substance, and therefore, to be unbegotten belongs to
the Father according to substance, and to be begotten belongs to
the Son according to substance; but to be unbegotten and to be
begotten are different; therefore the substance of the Father and
that of the Son are different. To whom we reply, If whatever is
spoken of God is spoken according to substance, then that which is
said, &#8220;I and the Father are one,&#8221;<note place="end" n="568" id="iv.i.vii.iii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.iii-p3"> <scripRef passage="John x. 30" id="iv.i.vii.iii-p3.2" parsed="|John|10|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.10.30">John x. 30</scripRef></p></note> is spoken according to substance.
Therefore there is one substance of the Father and the Son. Or if
this is not said according to substance, then something is said of
God not according to substance, and therefore we are no longer
compelled to understand unbegotten and begotten according to
substance. It is also said of the Son, &#8220;He thought it not robbery

For if He is not said to be equal according to substance, then they
admit that something may be said of God not according to substance.
Let them admit, then, that unbegotten and begotten are not spoken
according to substance. And if they do not admit this, on the
ground that they will have all things to be spoken of God according
to substance, then the Son is equal to the Father according to
substance.</p>

Always Implies Some Change in the Thing.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vii.iv-p2">5. That which is accidental
commonly implies that it can be lost by some change of the thing to
which it is an accident. For although some accidents are said to be
inseparable, which in Greek are called 
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.vii.iv-p2.1">&#7936;&#967;&#8061;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945;</span>, as the color black
is to the feather of a raven; <pb n="89" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_89.html" id="iv.i.vii.iv-Page_89"/>yet the feather loses that
color, not indeed so long as it is a feather, but because the
feather is not always. Wherefore the matter itself is changeable;
and whenever that animal or that feather ceases to be, and the
whole of that body is changed and turned into earth, it loses
certainly that color also. Although the kind of accident which is
called separable may likewise be lost, not by separation, but by
change; as, for instance, blackness is called a separable accident
to the hair of men, because hair continuing to be hair can grow
white; yet, if carefully considered, it is sufficiently apparent,
that it is not as if anything departed by separation away from the
head when it grows white, as though blackness departed thence and
went somewhere and whiteness came in its place, but that the
quality of color there is turned and changed. Therefore there is
nothing accidental in God, because there is nothing changeable or
that may be lost. But if you choose to call that also accidental,
which, although it may not be lost, yet can be decreased or
increased,&#8212;as, for instance, the life of the soul: for as long as
it is a soul, so long it lives, and because the soul is always, it
always lives; but because it lives more when it is wise, and less
when it is foolish, here, too, some change comes to pass, not such
that life is absent, as wisdom is absent to the foolish, but such
that it is less;&#8212;nothing of this kind, either, happens to God,
because He remains altogether unchangeable.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vii.v-p2">6. Wherefore nothing in Him is said
in respect to accident, since nothing is accidental to Him, and yet
all that is said is not said according to substance. For in created
and changeable things, that which is not said according to
substance, must, by necessary alternative, be said according to
accident. For all things are accidents to them, which can be either
lost or diminished, whether magnitudes or qualities; and so also is
that which is said in relation to something, as friendships,
relationships, services, likenesses, equalities, and anything else
of the kind; so also positions and conditions,<note place="end" n="570" id="iv.i.vii.v-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.v-p3"> <i>Habitus</i></p></note> places and times, acts and
passions. But in God nothing is said to be according to accident,
because in Him nothing is changeable; and yet everything that is
said, is not said, according to substance. For it is said in
relation to something, as the Father in relation to the Son and the
Son in relation to the Father, which is not accident; because both
the one is always Father, and the other is always Son: yet not
&#8220;always,&#8221; meaning from the time when the Son was born
[<i>natus</i>], so that the Father ceases not to be the Father
because the Son never <i>ceases</i> to be the Son, but because the
Son was <i>always</i> born, and never began to be the Son. But if
He had begun to be at any time, or were at any time to cease to be,
the Son, then He would be called Son according to accident. But if
the Father, in that He is called the Father, were so called in
relation to Himself, not to the Son; and the Son, in that He is
called the Son, were so called in relation to Himself, not to the
Father; then both the one would be called Father, and the other
Son, according to substance. But because the Father is not called
the Father except in that He has a Son, and the Son is not called
Son except in that He has a Father, these things are not said
according to substance; because each of them is not so called in
relation to Himself, but the terms are used reciprocally and in
relation each to the other; nor yet according to accident, because
both the being called the Father, and the being called the Son, is
eternal and unchangeable to them. Wherefore, although to be the
Father and to be the Son is different, yet their substance is not
different; because they are so called, not according to substance,
but according to relation, which relation, however, is not
accident, because it is not changeable.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vii.vi-p2">7. But if they think they can
answer this reasoning thus,&#8212;that the Father indeed is so called
in relation to the Son, and the Son in relation to the Father, but
that they are said to be unbegotten and begotten in relation to
themselves, not in relation each to the other; for that it is not
the same thing to call Him unbegotten as it is to call Him the
Father, because there would be nothing to hinder our calling Him
unbegotten even if He had not begotten the Son; and if any one
beget a son, he is not therefore himself unbegotten, for men, who
are begotten by other men, themselves also beget others; and
therefore they say the Father is called Father in relation to the
Son, and the Son is called Son in relation to the Father, but
unbegotten is said in relation to Himself, and begotten in relation
to Himself; and therefore, if whatever is said in relation to
oneself is said according to sub<pb n="90" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_90.html" id="iv.i.vii.vi-Page_90"/>stance, while to be unbegotten
and to be begotten are different, then the substance is
different:&#8212;if this is what they say, then they do not understand
that they do indeed say something that requires more careful
discussion in respect to the term unbegotten, because neither is
any one therefore a father because unbegotten, nor therefore
unbegotten because he is a father, and on that account he is
supposed to be called unbegotten, not in relation to anything else,
but in respect to himself; but, on the other hand, with a wonderful
blindness, they do not perceive that no one can be said to be
begotten except in relation to something. For he is therefore a son
because begotten; and because a son, therefore certainly begotten.
And as is the relation of son to father, so is the relation of the
begotten to the begetter; and as is the relation of father to son,
so is the relation of the begetter to the begotten. And therefore
any one is understood to be a begetter under one notion, but
understood to be unbegotten under another. For though both are said
of God the Father, yet the former is said in relation to the
begotten, that is to the Son, which, indeed, they do not deny; but
that He is called unbegotten, they declare to be said in respect to
Himself. They say then, If anything is said to be a father in
respect to itself, which cannot be said to be a son in respect to
itself, and whatever is said in respect to self is said according
to substance; and He is said to be unbegotten in respect to
Himself, which the Son cannot be said to be; therefore He is said
to be unbegotten according to substance; and because the Son cannot
be so said to be, therefore He is not of the same substance. This
subtlety is to be answered by compelling them to say themselves
according to what it is that the Son is equal to the Father;
whether according to that which is said in relation to Himself, or
according to that which is said in relation to the Father. For it
is not according to that which is said in relation to the Father,
since in relation to the Father He is said to be Son, and the
Father is not Son, but Father. Since Father and Son are not so
called in relation to each other in the same way as friends and
neighbors are; for a friend is so called relatively to his friend,
and if they love each other equally, then the same friendship is in
both; and a neighbor is so called relatively to a neighbor, and
because they are equally neighbors to each other (for each is
neighbor to the other, in the same degree as the other is neighbor
to him), there is the same neighborhood in both. But because the
Son is not so called relatively to the Son, but to the Father, it
is not according to that which is said in relation to the Father
that the Son is equal to the Father; and it remains that He is
equal according to that which is said in relation to Himself. But
whatever is said in relation to self is said according to
substance: it remains therefore that He is equal according to
substance; therefore the substance of both is the same. But when
the Father is said to be unbegotten, it is not said what He is, but
what He is not; and when a relative term is denied, it is not
denied according to substance, since the relative itself is not
affirmed according to substance.</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.vii.vii-p1.1">Chapter 7.&#8212;The Addition of a
Negative Does Not Change the Predicament.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vii.vii-p2">8. This is to be made clear by
examples. And first we must notice, that by the word begotten is
signified the same thing as is signified by the word son. For
therefore a son, because begotten, and because a son, therefore
certainly begotten. By the word unbegotten, therefore, it is
declared that he is not son. But begotten and unbegotten are both
of them terms suitably employed; whereas in Latin we can use the
word &#8220;filius,&#8221; but the custom of the language does not allow us
to speak of &#8220;infilius.&#8221; It makes no difference, however, in the
meaning if he is called &#8220;non filius;&#8221; just as it is precisely
the same thing if he is called &#8220;non genitus,&#8221; instead of
&#8220;ingenitus.&#8221; For so the terms of both neighbor and friend are
used relatively, yet we cannot speak of &#8220;invicinus&#8221; as we can
of &#8220;inimicus.&#8221; Wherefore, in speaking of this thing or that, we
must not consider what the usage of our own language either allows
or does not allow, but what clearly appears to be the meaning of
the things themselves. Let us not therefore any longer call it
unbegotten, although it can be so called in Latin; but instead of
this let us call it not begotten, which means the same. Is this
then anything else than saying that he is not a son? Now the
prefixing of that negative particle does not make that to be said
according to substance, which, without it, is said relatively; but
that only is denied, which, without it, was affirmed, as in the
other predicaments. When we say he is a man, we denote substance.
He therefore who says he is not a man, enunciates no other kind of
predicament, but only denies that. As therefore I affirm according
to substance in saying he is a man, so I deny according to
substance in saying he is not a man. And when the question is asked
how large he is? and I say he is quadrupedal, that is, four feet in
measure, <pb n="91" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_91.html" id="iv.i.vii.vii-Page_91"/>I affirm according to quantity, and he who says he is
not quadrupedal, denies according to quantity. I say he is white, I
affirm according to quality; if I say he is not white, I deny
according to quality. I say he is near, I affirm according to
relation; if I say he is not near, I deny according to relation. I
affirm according to position, when I say he lies down; I deny
according to position, when I say he does not lie down. I speak
according to condition,<note place="end" n="571" id="iv.i.vii.vii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.vii-p3"> <i>Habitus</i></p></note> when I say he is armed; I deny
according to condition, when I say he is not armed; and it comes to
the same thing as if I should say he is unarmed. I affirm according
to time, when I say he is of yesterday; I deny according to time,
when I say he is not of yesterday. And when I say he is at Rome, I
affirm according to place; and I deny according to place, when I
say he is not at Rome. I affirm according to the predicament of
action, when I say he smites; but if I say he does not smite, I
deny according to action, so as to declare that he does not so act.
And when I say he is smitten, I affirm according to the predicament
of passion; and I deny according to the same, when I say he is not
smitten. And, in a word, there is no kind of predicament according
to which we may please to affirm anything, without being proved to
deny according to the same predicament, if we prefix the negative
particle. And since this is so, if I were to affirm according to
substance, in saying son, I should deny according to substance, in
saying not son. But because I affirm relatively when I say he is a
son, for I refer to the father; therefore I deny relatively if I
say he is not a son, for I refer the same negation to the father,
in that I wish to declare that he has not a parent. But if to be
called son is precisely equivalent to the being called begotten (as
we said before), then to be called not begotten is precisely
equivalent to the being called not son. But we deny relatively when
we say he is not son, therefore we deny relatively when we say he
is not begotten. Further, what is unbegotten, unless not begotten?
We do not escape, therefore, from the relative predicament, when he
is called unbegotten. For as begotten is not said in relation to
self, but in that he is <i>of</i> a begetter; so when one is called
unbegotten, he is not so called in relation to himself, but it is
declared that he is not <i>of</i> a begetter. Both meanings,
however, turn upon the same predicament, which is called that of
relation. But that which is asserted relatively does not denote
substance, and accordingly, although begotten and unbegotten are
diverse, they do not denote a different substance; because, as son
is referred to father, and not son to not father, so it follows
inevitably that begotten must be referred to begetter, and
not-begotten to not-begetter.<note place="end" n="572" id="iv.i.vii.vii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.vii-p4"> The terms &#8220;unbegotten&#8221; and
&#8220;begotten&#8221; are interchangeable with the terms Father and Son.
This follows from the relation of a substantive to its adjective.
In whatever sense a substantive is employed, in the same sense must
the adjective formed from it be employed. Consequently, if the
first person of the Trinity may be called Father in a sense that
implies deity, he may be called Unbegotten in the same sense. And
if the second person may be called Son in a sense implying deity,
he may be called Begotten in the same sense. The Ancient church
often employed the adjective, and spoke of God the Unbegotten and
God the Begotten (Justin Martyr, <i>Apol</i>. i. 25, 53; ii. 12,
13. Clem. Alex. <i>Stromata</i> v. xii.). This phraseology sounds
strange to the Modern church, yet the latter really says the same
thing when it speaks of God the Father, and God the
Son.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note></p>

are of authority, have said, in that they could not find any other
more suitable way by which to enunciate in words that which they
understood without words. For, in truth, as the Father is not the
Son, and the Son is not the Father, and that Holy Spirit who is
also called the gift of God is neither the Father nor the Son,
certainly they are three. And so it is said plurally, &#8220;I and my

three essences, so we do not say three greatnesses, or three who
are great. For in things which are great by partaking of greatness,
to which it is one thing to <i>be</i>, and another to be <i>
great</i>, as a great house, and a great mountain, and a great
mind; in these things, I say, greatness is one thing, and that
which is great because of greatness is another, and a great house,
certainly, is not absolute greatness itself. But that is absolute
greatness by which not only a great house is great, and any great
mountain is great, but also by which every other thing whatsoever
is great, which is called great; so that greatness itself is one
thing, and those things are another which are called great from it.
And this greatness certainly is primarily great, and in a much more
excellent way than those things which are great by partaking of it.
But since God is not great with that greatness which is not
Himself, so that God, in being great, is, as it were, partaker of
that greatness;&#8212;otherwise that will be a greatness greater than
God, whereas there is nothing greater than God; therefore, He is
great with that greatness by which He Himself is that same
greatness. And, therefore, as we do not say three essences, so
neither do we say three greatnesses; for it is the same thing to
God to be, and to be great. For the same reason neither
<pb n="93" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_93.html" id="iv.i.vii.x-Page_93"/>do we
say three greats, but one who is great; since God is not great by
partaking of greatness, but He is great by Himself being great,
because He Himself is His own greatness. Let the same be said also
of the goodness, and of the eternity, and of the omnipotence of
God, and, in short, of all the predicaments which can be predicated
of God, as He is spoken of in respect to Himself, not
metaphorically and by similitude, but properly, if indeed anything
can be spoken of Him properly, by the mouth of man.</p>

Trinity, some things severally are specially predicated, these are
in no way said in reference to themselves in themselves, but either
in mutual reference, or in respect to the creature; and, therefore,
it is manifest that such things are spoken relatively, not in the
way of substance. For the Trinity is called one God, great, good,
eternal, omnipotent; and the same God Himself may be called His own
deity, His own magnitude, His own goodness, His own eternity, His
own omnipotence: but the Trinity cannot in the same way be called
the Father, except perhaps metaphorically, in respect to the
creature, on account of the adoption of sons. For that which is

certainly not to be understood as if the Son were excepted, or the
Holy Spirit were excepted; which one Lord our God we rightly call
also our Father, as regenerating us by His grace. Neither can the
Trinity in any wise be called the Son, but it can be called, in its

and the Son is a spirit, and the Father is holy and the Son is

Spirit, who is not the Trinity, but is understood as in the
Trinity, is spoken of in His proper name of the Holy Spirit
relatively, since He is referred both to the Father and to the Son,
because the Holy Spirit is the Spirit both of the Father and of the
Son. But the relation is not itself apparent in that name, but it
is apparent when He is called the gift of God;<note place="end" n="585" id="iv.i.vii.xi-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.xi-p5"> <scripRef passage="Acts viii. 20" id="iv.i.vii.xi-p5.2" parsed="|Acts|8|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.8.20">Acts viii. 20</scripRef></p></note> for He is the gift of the Father

certainly of the Holy Spirit Himself. When we say, therefore, the
gift of the giver, and the giver of the gift, we speak in both
cases relatively in reciprocal reference. Therefore the Holy Spirit
is a certain unutterable communion of the Father and the Son; and
on that account, perhaps, He is so called, because the same name is
suitable to both the Father and the Son. For He Himself is called
specially that which they are called in common; because both the
Father is a spirit and the Son a spirit, both the Father is holy
and the Son holy.<note place="end" n="588" id="iv.i.vii.xi-p7.3"><p id="iv.i.vii.xi-p8"> [The reason which Augustin here assigns, why the name
Holy Spirit is given to the third person&#8212;namely, because
spirituality is a characteristic of both the Father and Son, from
both of whom he proceeds&#8212;is not that assigned in the more
developed trinitarianism. The explanation in this latter is, that
the third person is denominated the Spirit because of the peculiar
manner in which the divine essence is <i>communicated</i> to
him&#8212;namely, by <i>spiration</i> or out-breathing: <i>spiritus
quia spiratus</i>. This is supported by the etymological
signification of <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.vii.xi-p8.1">
&#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;</span>, which is breath; and
by the symbolical action of Christ in 
<scripRef passage="John xx. 22" id="iv.i.vii.xi-p8.3" parsed="|John|20|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.20.22">John
xx. 22</scripRef>, which suggests the eternal spiration, or out-breathing
of the third person. The third trinitarian person is no more
spiritual, in the sense of immaterial, than the first and second
persons, and if the term &#8220;Spirit&#8221; is to be taken in this the
ordinary signification, the &#8220;trinitarian relation,&#8221; or personal
peculiarity, as Augustin remarks, &#8220;is not itself apparent in this
name;&#8221; because it would mention nothing distinctive of the third
person, and not belonging to the first and second. But taken
technically to denote the spiration or out-breathing by the Father
and Son, the trinitarian peculiarity is apparent in the
name.</p>
<p id="iv.i.vii.xi-p9">And the epithet
&#8220;Holy&#8221; is similarly explained. The third person is the Holy
Spirit, not because he is any more holy than the first and second,
but because he is the <i>source</i> and <i>author</i> of holiness
in all created spirits. This is eminently and officially his work.
In this way also, the epithet &#8220;Holy&#8221;&#8212;which in its ordinary
use would specify nothing peculiar to the third person,&#8212;mentions
a characteristic that differentiates him from the Father and
Son.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> In order,
therefore, that the communion of both may be signified from a name
which is suitable to both, the Holy Spirit is called the gift of
both. And this Trinity is one God, alone, good, great, eternal,
omnipotent; itself its own unity, deity, greatness, goodness,
eternity, omnipotence.</p>

us&#8212;since we have said that the Holy Spirit is so called
relatively, not the Trinity itself, but He who is in the
Trinity&#8212;that the designation of Him to whom He is referred, does
not seem to answer in turn to His designation. For we cannot, as we
say the servant of a master, and the master of a servant, the son
of a father and the father of a son, so also say here&#8212;because
these things are said relatively. For we speak of the Holy Spirit
of the Father; but, on the other hand, we do not speak of the
Father of the Holy Spirit, lest the Holy Spirit should be
understood to be His Son. So also we speak of the Holy Spirit of
the Son; but we do not speak of the Son of the <pb n="94" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_94.html" id="iv.i.vii.xii-Page_94"/>Holy Spirit,
lest the Holy Spirit be understood to be His Father. For it is the
case in many relatives, that no designation is to be found by which
those things which bear relation to each other may [in name]
mutually correspond to each other. For what is more clearly spoken
relatively than the word earnest? Since it is referred to that of
which it is an earnest, and an earnest is always an earnest of
something. Can we then, as we say, the earnest of the Father and of
the Son,<note place="end" n="589" id="iv.i.vii.xii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.xii-p3"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. v. 5" id="iv.i.vii.xii-p3.2" parsed="|2Cor|5|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.5">2 Cor. v. 5</scripRef>, and <scripRef passage="Eph. i. 14" id="iv.i.vii.xii-p3.3" parsed="|Eph|1|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.1.14">Eph. i.

therefore, relatively, and He is also relatively said to be the
Beginning, and whatever else there may be of the kind; but He is
called the Father in relation to the Son, the Beginning in relation
to all things, which are from Him. So the Son is relatively so
called; He is called also relatively the Word and the Image. And in
all these appellations He is referred to the Father, but the Father
is called by none of them. And the Son is also called the
Beginning; for when it was said to Him, &#8220;Who art Thou?&#8221; He
replied, &#8220;Even the Beginning, who also speak to you.&#8221;<note place="end" n="590" id="iv.i.vii.xiii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.xiii-p3"> <scripRef passage="John viii. 25" id="iv.i.vii.xiii-p3.2" parsed="|John|8|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.8.25">John viii. 25</scripRef></p></note> But is He,
pray, the Beginning of the Father? For He intended to show Himself
to be the Creator when He said that He was the Beginning, as the
Father also is the beginning of the creature in that all things are
from Him. For creator, too, is spoken relatively to creature, as
master to servant. And so when we say, both that the Father is the
Beginning, and that the Son is the Beginning, we do not speak of
two beginnings of the creature; since both the Father and the Son
together is one beginning in respect to the creature, as one
Creator, as one God. But if whatever remains within itself and
produces or works anything is a beginning to that thing which it
produces or works; then we cannot deny that the Holy Spirit also is
rightly called the Beginning, since we do not separate Him from the
appellation of Creator: and it is written of Him that He works; and
assuredly, in working, He remains within Himself; for He Himself is
not changed and turned into any of the things which He works. And
see what it is that He works: &#8220;But the manifestation of the
Spirit,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is given to every man to profit withal. For
to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the
word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same
Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to
another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another
the discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to
another the interpretation of tongues: but all these worketh that
one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He
will;&#8221; certainly as God&#8212;for who can work such great things but
God?&#8212;but &#8220;it is the same God which worketh all in all.&#8221;<note place="end" n="591" id="iv.i.vii.xiii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.xiii-p4"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xii. 6-11" id="iv.i.vii.xiii-p4.2" parsed="|1Cor|12|6|12|11" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.6-1Cor.12.11">1 Cor. xii. 6&#8211;11</scripRef></p></note> For if we

of the Holy Spirit &#8220;begins&#8221; by spiration from the Father and

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vii.xv-p2">16. But it is asked further,
whether, as the Son, by being born, has not only this, that He is
the Son, but that He is absolutely; and so also the Holy Spirit, by
being given, has not only this, that He is given, but that He is
absolutely&#8212;whether therefore He was, before He was given, but was
not yet a <i>gift</i>; or whether, for the very reason that God was
about to give Him, He was already a gift also before He was given.
But if He does not proceed unless when He is given, and assuredly
could not proceed before there was one to whom He might be given;
how, in that case, was He [absolutely] in His very substance, if He
is not unless because He is given? just as the Son, by being born,
not only has this, that He is a Son, which is said relatively, but
His very substance absolutely, so that He is. Does the Holy Spirit
proceed always, and proceed not in time, but from eternity, but
because He so proceeded that He was capable of being given, was
already a gift even before there was one to whom He might be given?
For there is a difference in meaning between a gift and a thing
that has been given. For a gift may exist even before it is given;
but it cannot be called a thing that has been given unless it has
been given.</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.vii.xvi-p1.1">Chapter
16.&#8212;What is Said of God in Time, is Said Relatively, Not
Accidentally.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vii.xvi-p2">17. Nor let it trouble us that the
Holy Spirit, although He is co-eternal with the Father and the Son,
yet is called something which exists in time; as, for instance,
this very thing which we have called Him, a thing that has been
given. For the Spirit is a gift eternally, but a thing that has
been given in time. For if a lord also is not so called unless when
he begins to have a slave, that appellation likewise is relative
and in time to God; for the creature is not from all eternity, of
which He is the Lord. How then shall we make it good that relative
terms themselves are not accidental, since nothing happens
accidentally to God in time, because He is incapable of change, as
we have argued in the beginning of this discussion? Behold! to be
the Lord, is not eternal to God; otherwise we should be compelled
to say that the creature also is from eternity, since He would not
be a lord from all eternity unless the creature also was a servant
from all eternity. But as he cannot be a slave who has not a lord,
neither can he be a lord who has not a slave. And if there be any
one who says that God, indeed, is alone eternal, and that times
are <pb n="96" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_96.html" id="iv.i.vii.xvi-Page_96"/>not eternal on account of their variety and
changeableness, but that times nevertheless did not begin to be in
time (for there was no time before times began, and therefore it
did not happen to God in time that He should be Lord, since He was
Lord of the very times themselves, which assuredly did not begin in
time): what will he reply respecting man, who was made in time, and
of whom assuredly He was not the Lord before he was of whom He was
to be Lord? Certainly to be the Lord of man happened to God in
time. And that all dispute may seem to be taken away, certainly to
be your Lord, or mine, who have only lately begun to be, happened
to God in time. Or if this, too, seems uncertain on account of the
obscure question respecting the soul, what is to be said of His
being the Lord of the people of Israel? since, although the nature
of the soul already existed, which that people had (a matter into
which we do not now inquire), yet that people existed not as yet,
and the time is apparent when it began to exist. Lastly, that He
should be Lord of this or that tree, or of this or that corn crop,
which only lately began to be, happened in time; since, although
the matter itself already existed, yet it is one thing to be Lord
of the matter (<i>materi&#230;</i>), another to be Lord of the already
created nature (<i>natur&#230;</i>).<note place="end" n="599" id="iv.i.vii.xvi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.xvi-p3"> [&#8220;Matter&#8221; denotes the material
as created <i>ex nihilo</i>: &#8220;nature&#8221; the material as formed
into individuals. In this reference, Augustin speaks of &#8220;the
nature of the soul&#8221; of the people of Israel as existing while
&#8220;as yet that people existed not&#8221; individually&#8212; having in mind
their race-existence in Adam.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> For man, too, is lord of the wood
at one time, and at another he is lord of the chest, although
fabricated of that same wood; which he certainly was not at the
time when he was already the lord of the wood. How then shall we
make it good that nothing is said of God according to accident,
except because nothing happens to His nature by which He may be
changed, so that those things are relative accidents which happen
in connection with some change of the things of which they are
spoken. As a friend is so called relatively: for he does not begin
to be one, unless when he has begun to love; therefore some change
of will takes place, in order that he may be called a friend. And
money, when it is called a price, is spoken of relatively, and yet
it was not changed when it began to be a price; nor, again, when it
is called a pledge, or any other thing of the kind. If, therefore,
money can so often be spoken of relatively with no change of
itself, so that neither when it begins, nor when it ceases to be so
spoken of, does any change take place in that nature or form of it,
whereby it is money; how much more easily ought we to admit,
concerning that unchangeable substance of God, that something may
be so predicated relatively in respect to the creature, that
although it begin to be so predicated in time, yet nothing shall be
understood to have happened to the substance itself of God, but
only to that creature in respect to which it is predicated?
&#8220;Lord,&#8221; it is said, &#8220;Thou hast been made our refuge.&#8221;<note place="end" n="600" id="iv.i.vii.xvi-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.xvi-p4"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xc." id="iv.i.vii.xvi-p4.2" parsed="|Ps|90|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.90">Ps. xc.</scripRef>1</p></note> God,
therefore, is said to be our refuge relatively, for He is referred
to us, and He then becomes our refuge when we flee to Him; pray
does anything come to pass then in His nature, which, before we
fled to Him, was not? In us therefore some change does take place;
for we were worse before we fled to Him, and we become better by
fleeing to Him: but in Him there is no change. So also He begins to
be our Father, when we are regenerated through His grace, since He
gave us power to become the sons of God.<note place="end" n="601" id="iv.i.vii.xvi-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.xvi-p5"> <scripRef passage="John i. 12" id="iv.i.vii.xvi-p5.2" parsed="|John|1|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.12">John i. 12</scripRef></p></note> Our substance therefore is changed
for the better, when we become His sons; and He at the same time
begins to be our Father, but without any change of His own
substance. Therefore that which begins to be spoken of God in time,
and which was not spoken of Him before, is manifestly spoken of Him
relatively; yet not according to any accident of God, so that
anything should have happened to Him, but clearly according to some
accident of that, in respect to which God begins to be called
something relatively. When a righteous man begins to be a friend of
God, he himself is changed; but far be it from us to say, that God
loves any one in time with as it were a new love, which was not in
Him before, with whom things gone by have not passed away and
things future have been already done. Therefore He loved all His
saints before the foundation of the world, as He predestinated
them; but when they are converted and find them; then they are said
to begin to be loved by Him, that what is said may be said in that
way in which it can be comprehended by human affections. So also,
when He is said to be wroth with the unrighteous, and gentle with
the good, they are changed, not He: just as the light is
troublesome to weak eyes, pleasant to those that are strong;
namely, by their change, not its own.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.viii.i-p2">1. <span class="c19" id="iv.i.viii.i-p2.1">
Some</span>think themselves hindered from
admitting the equality of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, because
it is written, &#8220;Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of
God;&#8221; in that, on this ground, there does not appear to be
equality; because the Father is not Himself power and wisdom, but
the begetter of power and wisdom. And, in truth, the question is
usually asked with no common earnestness, in what way God can be
called the Father of power and wisdom. For the apostle says,
&#8220;Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.&#8221;<note place="end" n="602" id="iv.i.viii.i-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.viii.i-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 24" id="iv.i.viii.i-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|1|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.24">1 Cor. i. 24</scripRef></p></note> And hence
some on our side have reasoned in this way against the Arians, at
least against those who at first set themselves up against the
Catholic faith. For Arius himself is reported to have said, that if
He is a Son, then He was born; if He was born, there was a time
when the Son was not: not understanding that even to be born is, to
God, from all eternity; so that the Son is co-eternal with the
Father, as the brightness which is produced and is spread around by
fire is co-eval with it, and would be co-eternal, if fire were
eternal. And therefore some of the later Arians have abandoned that
opinion, and have confessed that the Son of God did not begin to be
in time. But among the arguments which those on our side used to
hold against them who said that there was a time when the Son was
not, some were wont to introduce such an argument as this: If the
Son of God is the power and wisdom of God, and God was never
without power and wisdom, then the Son is co-eternal with God the
Father; but the apostle says, &#8220;Christ the power of God, and the
wisdom of God;&#8221; and a man must be senseless to say that God at
any time had not power or wisdom; therefore there was no time when
the Son was not.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.viii.i-p4">2. Now this argument compels us to
say that God the Father is not wise, except by having the wisdom
which He begat, not by the Father in Himself being wisdom itself.
Further, if it be so, just as the Son also Himself is called God of
God, Light of Light, we must consider whether He can be called
wisdom of wisdom, if God the Father is not wisdom itself, but only
the begetter of wisdom. And if we hold this, why is He not the
begetter also of His own greatness, and of His own goodness, and of
His own eternity, and of His own omnipotence; so that He is not
Himself His own greatness, and His own goodness, and His own
eternity, and His own omnipotence; but is great with that greatness
which He begat, and good with that goodness, and eternal with that
eternity, and omnipotent with that omnipotence, which was born of
Him; just as He Himself is not His own wisdom, but is wise with
that wisdom which was born of Him? For we need not be afraid of
being compelled to say <pb n="98" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_98.html" id="iv.i.viii.i-Page_98"/>that there are many sons of God,
over and above the adoption of the creature, co-eternal with the
Father, if He be the begetter of His own greatness, and goodness,
and eternity, and omnipotence. Because it is easy to reply to this
cavil, that it does not at all follow, because many things are
named, that He should be the Father of many co-eternal <i>sons</i>;
just as it does not follow that He is the Father of two sons,
because Christ is said to be the power of God, and the wisdom of
God. For that certainly is the power which is the wisdom, and that
is the wisdom which is the power; and in like manner, therefore, of
the rest also; so that that is the greatness which is the power, or
any other of those things which either have been mentioned above,
or may hereafter be mentioned.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.viii.ii-p2">3. But if nothing is spoken of the
Father as such, except that which is spoken of Him in relation to
the Son, that is, that He is His father, or begetter, or beginning;
and if also the begetter is by consequence a beginning to that
which he begets of himself; but whatever else is spoken of Him is
so spoken as <i>with</i> the Son, or rather <i>in</i> the Son;
whether that He is great with that greatness which He begat, or
just with that justice which He begat, or good with that goodness
which He begat, or powerful with that force or power which He
begat, or wise with that wisdom which He begat: yet the Father is
not said to be greatness itself, but the begetter of greatness; but
the Son, as He is called the Son as such, is not so called <i>
with</i> the Father but in relation <i>to</i> the Father, so is not
great in and by himself, but <i>with</i> the Father, of whom He is
the greatness; and so also is called wise <i>with</i> the Father,
of whom He Himself is the wisdom; just as the Father is called wise
<i>with</i> the Son, because He is wise with that wisdom which He
begat; therefore the one is not called without the other, whatever
they are called in respect to themselves; that is, whatever they
are called that manifests their essential nature, both are so
called together;&#8212;if these things are so, then the Father is not
God without the Son, nor the Son God without the Father, but both
together are God. And that which is said, &#8220;In the beginning was
the Word,&#8221; means that the Word was in the Father. Or if &#8220;In the
beginning&#8221; is intended to mean, Before all things; then in that
which follows, &#8220;And the Word was with God,&#8221; the Son alone is
understood to be the Word, not the Father and Son together, as
though both were one Word (for He is the Word in the same way as He
is the Image, but the Father and Son are not both together the
Image, but the Son alone is the Image of the Father: just as He is
also the Son of the Father, for both together are not the Son). But
in that which is added, &#8220;And the Word was with God,&#8221; there is
much reason to understand thus: &#8220;The Word,&#8221; which is the Son
alone, &#8220;was with God,&#8221; which is not the Father alone, but God
the Father and the Son together.<note place="end" n="603" id="iv.i.viii.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.viii.ii-p3"> [The term &#8220;God,&#8221; in the
proposition, &#8220;the Word was with God,&#8221; must refer to the Father,
not to &#8220;the Father and Son together,&#8221; because the Son could not
be said to be &#8220;with&#8221; himself. St. John says that &#8220;the word
was God&#8221; (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.viii.ii-p3.1">&#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962;</span>). The

&#952;&#949;&#8056;&#957;</span>). The presence of the
article in this instance denotes one of the divine persons in the
essence: namely, the Father, with whom the Word was from eternity,
and upon whose &#8220;bosom&#8221; he was from eternity. (<scripRef passage="John i. 18" id="iv.i.viii.ii-p3.5" parsed="|John|1|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.18">John i. 18</scripRef>).&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> But what wonder is there, if this
can be said in the case of some twofold things widely different
from each other? For what are so different as soul and body? Yet we
can say the soul was with a man, that is, in a man; although the
soul is not the body, and man is both soul and body together. So
that what follows in the Scripture, &#8220;And the Word was God,&#8221;<note place="end" n="604" id="iv.i.viii.ii-p3.6"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.viii.ii-p4"> <scripRef passage="John i. 1" id="iv.i.viii.ii-p4.2" parsed="|John|1|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.1">John i. 1</scripRef></p></note> may be
understood thus: The Word, which is not the Father, was God
together with the Father. Are we then to say thus, that the Father
is the begetter of His own greatness, that is, the begetter of His
own power, or the begetter of His own wisdom; and that the Son is
greatness, and power, and wisdom; but that the great, omnipotent,
and wise God, is both together? How then God <i>of</i> God, Light
of Light? For not both together are God of God, but only the Son is
of God, that is to say, of the Father; nor are both together Light
of Light, but the Son only is of Light, that is, of the Father.
Unless, perhaps, it was in order to intimate and inculcate briefly
that the Son is co-eternal with the Father, that it is said, God of
God, and Light of Light, or anything else of the like kind: as if
to say, This which is not the Son without the Father, <i>of</i>
this which is not the Father without the Son; that is, this Light
which is not Light without the Father, <i>of</i> that Light, <i>
viz</i>. the Father, which is not Light without the Son; so that,
when it is said, God which is not the Son without the Father, and
<i>of</i> God which is not the Father without the Son, it may be
perfectly understood that the Begetter did not precede that which
He begot. And if this be so, then this alone cannot be said of
them, namely, this or that of this or that, which they are not both
together. Just as the Word cannot be said to be <i>of</i>
the <pb n="99" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_99.html" id="iv.i.viii.ii-Page_99"/>Word, because both are not the Word together, but only
the Son; nor image <i>of</i> image, since they are not both

God is blessed and perfect without the human spirit, but the spirit
of man cannot be blessed without God. Nor is it without cause, I
think, that when the Lord said so much in the Gospel according to
John, and so often, of unity itself, whether of His own with the
Father, or of ours interchangeably with ourselves; He has nowhere
said, that we are also one with Himself, but, &#8220;that they maybe
one as we also are one.&#8221;<note place="end" n="609" id="iv.i.viii.iii-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.viii.iii-p6"> <scripRef passage="John xvii. 11" id="iv.i.viii.iii-p6.2" parsed="|John|17|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.17.11">John xvii. 11</scripRef></p></note> Therefore the Father and the Son

greater? For if greater, He is greater by greatness; but whereas

He who begat Him, nor is the Father greater than that greatness,

equal, if not in that which He is, to whom it is not one thing to
be, and another to be great? Or if the Father is greater in
eternity, the Son is not equal in anything whatsoever. For whence
equal? If you say in greatness, that greatness is not equal which
is less eternal, and so of all things else. Or is He perhaps equal
in power, but not equal in wisdom? But how is that power which is
less wise, equal? Or is He equal in wisdom, but not equal in power?
But how is that wisdom equal which is less powerful? It remains,
therefore, that if He is not equal in anything, He is not equal in
all. But Scripture proclaims, that &#8220;He thought it not robbery to

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.viii.iv-p2">6. For in like manner the virtues
which are in the human mind, although each has its own several and
different meaning, yet are in no way mutually separable; so that,
for instance, whosoever were equal in courage, are equal also in
prudence, and temperance, and justice. For if you say that such and
such men are equal in courage, but that one of them is greater in
prudence, it follows that the courage of the other is less prudent,
and so neither are they equal in courage, since the courage of the
former is more prudent. And so you will find it to be the case with
the other virtues, if you consider them one by one. For the
question is not of the strength of the body, but of the courage
of <pb n="100" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_100.html" id="iv.i.viii.iv-Page_100"/>the mind. How much more therefore is this the case in
that unchangeable and eternal substance, which is incomparably more
simple than the human mind is? Since, in the human mind, to be is
not the same as to be strong, or prudent, or just, or temperate;
for a mind can exist, and yet have none of these virtues. But in
God to be is the same as to be strong, or to be just, or to be
wise, or whatever is said of that simple multiplicity, or multifold
simplicity, whereby to signify His substance. Wherefore, whether we
say God of God in such way that this name belongs to each, yet not
so that both together are two Gods, but one God; for they are in
such way united with each other, as according to the apostle&#8217;s
testimony may take place even in diverse and differing substances;
for both the Lord alone is a Spirit, and the spirit of a man alone
is assuredly a spirit; yet, if it cleave to the Lord, &#8220;it is one
spirit:&#8221; how much more there, where there is an absolutely
inseparable and eternal union, so that He may not seem absurdly to
be called as it were the Son of both, when He is called the Son of
God, if that which is called God is only said of both together. Or
perhaps it is, that whatever is said of God so as to indicate His
substance, is not said except of both together, nay of the Trinity
itself together? Whether therefore it be this or that (which needs
a closer inquiry), it is enough for the present to see from what
has been said, that the Son is in no respect equal with the Father,
if He is found to be unequal in anything which has to do with
signifying His substance, as we have already shown. But the apostle
has said that He is equal. Therefore the Son is equal with the
Father in all things, and is of one and the same
substance.</p>

For whether He is the unity of both, or the holiness, or the love,
or therefore the unity because the love, and therefore the love

through whom the two are joined, through whom the Begotten is loved

cleaves to Him so as to follow Him. And it is good for us to cleave
to God, since He will destroy every man who is estranged from
Him. Therefore
the Holy Spirit, whatever it is, is something common both to the
Father and Son. But that communion itself is consubstantial and
co-eternal; and if it may fitly be called friendship, let it be so
called; but it is more aptly called love. And this is also a
substance, since God is a substance, and &#8220;God is love,&#8221; as it

a substance together with the Father and the Son, so that substance
is together with them great, and together with them good, and

to be great or to be good, and the rest, as we have shown above.
For if love is less great therein [<i>i.e.</i> in God] than wisdom,
then wisdom is loved in less degree than according to what it is;
love is therefore equal, in order that wisdom may be loved
according to its being; but wisdom is equal with the Father, as we
have proved above; therefore also the Holy Spirit is equal; and if
equal, equal in all things, on account of the absolute simplicity
which is in that substance. And therefore they are not more than
three: One who loves Him who is from Himself, and One who loves Him
from whom He is, and Love itself. And if this last is nothing, how
is &#8220;God love&#8221;? If it is not substance, how is God
substance?</p>

Substance Both Simple and Manifold.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.viii.vi-p2">8. But if it is asked how that
substance is both simple and manifold: consider, first, why the
creature is manifold, but in no way really simple. And first, all
that is body is composed certainly of parts; so that therein one
part is greater, another less, and the whole is greater than any
part whatever or how great soever. For the heaven and the earth are
parts of the whole bulk of the world; and the earth alone, and the
heaven alone, is composed of innumerable parts; and its third part
is less than the remainder, and the half of it is less than the
whole; and the whole body of the world, which is usually
<pb n="101" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_101.html" id="iv.i.viii.vi-Page_101"/>called
by its two parts, <i>viz</i>. the heaven and the earth, is
certainly greater than the heaven alone or the earth alone. And in
each several body, size is one thing, color another, shape another;
for the same color and the same shape may remain with diminished
size; and the same shape and the same size may remain with the
color changed; and the same shape not remaining, yet the thing may
be just as great, and of the same color. And whatever other things
are predicated together of body can be changed either all together,
or the larger part of them without the rest. And hence the nature
of body is conclusively proved to be manifold, and in no respect
simple. The spiritual creature also, that is, the soul, is indeed
the more simple of the two if compared with the body; but if we
omit the comparison with the body, it is manifold, and itself also
not simple. For it is on this account more simple than the body,
because it is not diffused in bulk through extension of place, but
in each body, it is both whole in the whole, and whole in each
several part of it; and, therefore, when anything takes place in
any small particle whatever of the body, such as the soul can feel,
although it does not take place in the whole body, yet the whole
soul feels it, since the whole soul is not unconscious of it. But,
nevertheless, since in the soul also it is one thing to be
skillful, another to be indolent, another to be intelligent,
another to be of retentive memory; since cupidity is one thing,
fear another, joy another, sadness another; and since things
innumerable, and in innumerable ways, are to be found in the nature
of the soul, some without others, and some more, some less; it is
manifest that its nature is not simple, but manifold. For nothing
simple is changeable, but every creature is changeable.</p>

can say the Father alone, because there is no Father in the Godhead

the only true God is not the Father alone, but the Father and the
Son and the Holy Spirit. For if any one should ask whether the
Father alone is God, how can it be replied that He is not, unless
perhaps we were to say that the Father indeed is God, but that He
is not God alone, but that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are God
alone? But then what shall we do with that testimony of the Lord?
For He was speaking to the Father, and had named the Father as Him
to whom He was speaking, when He says, &#8220;And this is life eternal,

He wished to intimate that the Father alone is the true God; lest
we should not understand any to be God, except the three together,
the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Are we therefore, from the
testimony of the Lord, both to call the Father the one true God,
and the Son the one true God, and the Holy Spirit the one true God,
and the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit together, that is, the
Trinity itself together, not three true Gods but one true God? Or

is this, &#8220;That they may know Thee, and Jesus Christ whom Thou
hast sent, the one true God?&#8221; Why then did He omit to mention the
Holy Spirit? Is it because it follows, that whenever we name One
who cleaves to One by a harmony so great that through this harmony
both are one, this harmony itself must be understood, although it
is not mentioned? For in that place, too, the apostle seems as it
were to pass over the Holy Spirit; and yet there, too, He is

shall consider somewhat more carefully hereafter. At present the
equality and one and the same substance of the Trinity has been

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.viii.x-p2">11. A certain writer, when he would
briefly intimate the special attributes of each of the persons in
the Trinity, tells us that &#8220;Eternity is in the Father, form in
the Image, use in the Gift.&#8221; And since he was a man of no mean
authority in handling the Scriptures, and in the assertion of the
faith, for it is Hilary who put this in his book (<i>On the
Trinity, ii.</i>); I have searched into the hidden meaning of these
words as far as I can, that is, of the Father, and the Image, and
the Gift, of eternity, and of form, and of use. And I do not think
that he intended more by the word eter<pb n="103" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_103.html" id="iv.i.viii.x-Page_103"/>nity, than
that the Father has not a father from whom He is; but the Son is
from the Father, so as to be, and so as to be co-eternal with Him.
For if an image perfectly fills the measure of that of which it is
the image, then the image is made equal to that of which it is the
image, not the latter to its own image. And in respect to this
image he has named form, I believe on account of the quality of
beauty, where there is at once such great fitness, and prime
equality, and prime likeness, differing in nothing, and unequal in
no respect, and in no part unlike, but answering exactly to Him
whose image it is: where there is prime and absolute life, to whom
it is not one thing to live, and another to be, but the same thing
to be and to live; and prime and absolute intellect, to whom it is
not one thing to live, another to understand, but to understand is
to live, and is to be, and all things are one: as though a perfect
Word (<scripRef passage="John i. 1" id="iv.i.viii.x-p2.2" parsed="|John|1|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.1">John i. 1</scripRef>), to which
nothing is wanting, and a certain skill of the omnipotent and wise
God, full of all living, unchangeable sciences, and all one in it,
as itself is one from one, with whom it is one. Therein God knew
all things which He made by it; and therefore, while times pass
away and succeed, nothing passes away or succeeds to the knowledge
of God. For things which are created are not therefore known by
God, because they have been made; and not rather have been
therefore made, even although changeable, because they are known
unchangeably by Him. Therefore that unspeakable conjunction of the
Father and His image is not without fruition, without love, without
joy. Therefore that love, delight, felicity, or blessedness, if
indeed it can be worthily expressed by any human word, is called by
him, in short, Use; and is the Holy Spirit in the Trinity, not
begotten, but the sweetness of the begetter and of the begotten,
filling all creatures according to their capacity with abundant
bountifulness and copiousness, that they may keep their proper
order and rest satisfied in their proper place.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.viii.x-p3">12. Therefore all these things
which are made by divine skill, show in themselves a certain unity,
and form, and order; for each of them is both some one thing, as
are the several natures of bodies and dispositions of souls; and is

and the various learning or skill of souls; and seeks or preserves
a certain order, as are the several weights or combinations of

creature, as is fitting. For in that Trinity is the supreme source
of all things, and the most perfect beauty, and the most blessed

determined to each other, and are in themselves infinite. But here
in corporeal things, one thing alone is not as much as three
together, and two are something more than one; but in that highest
Trinity one is as much as the three together, nor are two anything

Let</span> us now inquire more carefully, so far
as God grants, into that which a little before we deferred; whether
each person also in the Trinity can also by Himself and not with
the other two be called God, or great, or wise, or true, or
omnipotent, or just, or anything else that can be said of God, not
relatively, but absolutely; or whether these things cannot be said
except when the Trinity is understood. For the question is
raised,&#8212;because it is written, &#8220;Christ the power of God, and
the wisdom of God,&#8221;<note place="end" n="627" id="iv.i.ix.i-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.ix.i-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 24" id="iv.i.ix.i-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|1|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.24">1 Cor. i. 24</scripRef></p></note>&#8212;whether He is so the Father of
His own wisdom and His own power, as that He is wise with that
wisdom which He begat, and powerful with that power which He begat;
and whether, since He is always powerful and wise, He always begat
power and wisdom. For if it be so, then, as we have said, why is He
not also the Father of His own greatness by which He is great, and
of His own goodness by which He is good, and of His own justice by
which He is just, and whatever else there is? Or if all these
things are understood, although under more names than one, to be in
the same wisdom and power, so that that is greatness which is
power, that is goodness which is wisdom, and that again is wisdom
which is power, as we have already argued; then let us remember,
that when I mention any one of these, I am to be taken as if I
mentioned all. It is asked, then, whether the Father also by
Himself is wise, and is Himself His own wisdom itself; or whether
He is wise in the same way as He speaks. For He speaks by the Word
which He begat, not by the word which is uttered, and sounds, and
passes away, but by the Word which was with God, and the Word was
God, and all things were made by Him:<note place="end" n="628" id="iv.i.ix.i-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.ix.i-p4"> <scripRef passage="John i. 1, 3" id="iv.i.ix.i-p4.2" parsed="|John|1|1|0|0;|John|1|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.1 Bible:John.1.3">John i. 1, 3</scripRef></p></note> by the Word which is equal to
Himself, by whom He always and unchangeably utters Himself. For He
is not Himself the Word, as He is not the Son nor the image. But in
speaking (putting aside those words of God in time which are
produced in the creature, for they sound and pass away,&#8212;in
speaking then) by that co-eternal Word, He is not understood
singly, but with that Word itself, without whom certainly He does
not speak. Is He then in such way wise as He is one who speaks, so
as to be in such way wisdom, as He is the Word, and so that to be
the Word is to be wisdom, that is, also to be power, so that power
and wisdom and the Word may be <pb n="105" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_105.html" id="iv.i.ix.i-Page_105"/>the same, and be so called
relatively as the Son and the image: and that the Father is not
singly powerful or wise, but together with the power and wisdom
itself which He begat (<i>genuit</i>); just as He is not singly one
who speaks, but by that Word and together with that Word which He
begat; and in like way great by that and together with that
greatness, which He begat? And if He is not great by one thing, and
God by another, but great by that whereby He is God, because it is
not one thing to Him to be great and another to be God; it follows
that neither is He God singly, but by that and together with that
deity (<i>deitas</i>) which He begat; so that the Son is the deity
of the Father, as He is the wisdom and power of the Father, and as
He is the Word and image of the Father. And because it is not one
thing to Him to be, another to be God, the Son is also the essence
of the Father, as He is His Word and image. And hence also&#8212;except
that He is the Father [the Unbegotten]&#8212;the Father is not anything
unless because He has the Son; so that not only that which is meant
by Father (which it is manifest He is not called relatively to
Himself but to the Son, and therefore is the Father because He has
the Son), but that which He is in respect to His own substance is
so called, because He begat His own essence. For as He is great,
only with that greatness which He begat, so also He is, only with
that essence which He begat; because it is not one thing to Him to
be, and another to be great. Is He therefore the Father of His own
essence, in the same way as He is the Father of His own greatness,
as He is the Father of His own power and wisdom? since His
greatness is the same as His power, and His essence the same as His
greatness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ix.i-p5">2. This discussion has arisen from
that which is written, that &#8220;Christ is the power of God, and the
wisdom of God.&#8221; Wherefore our discourse is compressed into these
narrow limits, while we desire to speak things unspeakable; that
either we must say that Christ is not the power of God and the
wisdom of God, and so shamelessly and impiously resist the apostle;
or we must acknowledge that Christ is indeed the power of God and
the wisdom of God, but that His Father is not the Father of His own
power and wisdom, which is not less impious; for so neither will He
be the Father of Christ, because Christ is the power of God and the
wisdom of God; or that the Father is not powerful with His own
power, or wise with His own wisdom: and who shall dare to say this?
Or yet, again, that we must understand, that in the Father it is
one thing to be, another thing to be wise, so that He is not by
that by which He is wise: a thing usually understood of the soul,
which is at some times unwise, at others wise; as being by nature
changeable, and not absolutely and perfectly simple. Or, again,
that the Father is not anything in respect to His own substance;
and that not only that He is the Father, but that He <i>is</i>, is
said relatively to the Son. How then can the Son be of the same
essence as the Father, seeing that the Father, in respect to
Himself, is neither His own essence, nor <i>is</i> at all in
respect to Himself, but even His essence is in relation to the Son?
But, on the contrary, much more is He of one and the same essence,
since the Father and Son are one and the same essence; seeing that
the Father has His being itself not in respect to Himself, but to
the Son, which essence He begat, and by which essence He is
whatever He is. Therefore neither [person] <i>is</i> in respect to
Himself alone; and both exist relatively the one to the other. Or
is the Father alone not called Father of himself, but whatever He
is called, is called relatively to the Son, but the Son is
predicated of in reference to Himself? And if it be so, what is
predicated of Him in reference to Himself? Is it His essence
itself? But the Son is the essence of the Father, as He is the
power and wisdom of the Father, as He is the Word of the Father,
and the image of the Father. Or if the Son is called essence in
reference to Himself, but the Father is not essence, but the
begetter of the essence, and <i>is</i> not in respect to Himself,
but <i>is</i> by that very essence which He begat; as He is great
by that greatness which He begat: therefore the Son is also called
greatness in respect to Himself; therefore He is also called, in
like manner, power, and wisdom, and word, and image. But what can
be more absurd than that He should be called image in respect to
Himself? Or if image and word are not the very same with power and
wisdom, but the former are spoken relatively, and the latter in
respect to self, not to another; then we get to this, that the
Father is not wise with that wisdom which He begat, because He
Himself cannot be spoken relatively to it, and it cannot be spoken
relatively to Him. For all things which are said relatively are
said reciprocally; therefore it remains that even in essence the
Son is spoken of relatively to the Father. But from this is educed
a most unexpected sense: that essence itself is not essence, or at
least that, when it is called essence, not essence but something
relative is intimated. As when <pb n="106" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_106.html" id="iv.i.ix.i-Page_106"/>we speak of a master, essence
is not intimated, but a relative which has reference to a slave;
but when we speak of a man, or any such thing which is said in
respect to self not to something else, then essence is intimated.
Therefore when a man is called a master, man himself is essence,
but he is called master relatively; for he is called man in respect
to himself, but master in respect to his slave. But in regard to
the point from which we started, if essence itself is spoken
relatively, essence itself is not essence. Add further, that all
essence which is spoken of relatively, is also something, although
the relation be taken away; as <i>e.g.</i> in the case of a man who
is a master, and a man who is a slave, and a horse that is a beast
of burden, and money that is a pledge, the man, and the horse, and
the money are spoken in respect to themselves, and are substances
or essences; but master, and slave, and beast of burden, and
pledge, are spoken relatively to something. But if there were not a
man, that is, some substance, there would be none who could be
called relatively a master; and if there were no horse having a
certain essence, there would be nothing that could be called
relatively a beast of burden; so if money were not some kind of
substance, it could not be called relatively a pledge. Wherefore,
if the Father also is not something in respect to Himself then
there is no one at all that can be spoken of relatively to
something. For it is not as it is with color. The color of a thing
is referred to the thing colored, and color is not spoken at all in
reference to substance, but is always of something that is colored;
but that thing of which it is the color, even if it is referred to
color in respect to its being colored, is yet, in respect to its
being a body, spoken of in respect to substance. But in no way may
we think, in like manner, that the Father cannot be called anything
in respect to His own substance, but that whatever He is called, He
is called in relation to the Son; while the same Son is spoken of
both in respect to His own substance and in relation to the Father,
when He is called great greatness, and powerful power, plainly in
respect to Himself, and the greatness and power of the great and
powerful Father, by which the Father is great and powerful. It is
not so; but both are substance, and both are one substance. And as
it is absurd to say that whiteness is not white, so is it absurd to
say that wisdom is not wise; and as whiteness is called white in
respect to itself, so also wisdom is called wise in respect to
itself. But the whiteness of a body is not an essence, since the
body itself is the essence, and that is a quality of it; and hence
also a body is said from that quality to be white, to which body to
be is not the same thing as to be white. For the form in it is one
thing, and the color another; and both are not in themselves, but
in a certain bulk, which bulk is neither form nor color, but is
formed and colored. True wisdom is both wise, and wise in itself.
And since in the case of every soul that becomes wise by partaking
of wisdom, if it again becomes foolish, yet wisdom in itself
remains; nor when that soul was changed into folly is the wisdom
likewise so changed; therefore wisdom is not in him who becomes
wise by it, in the same manner as whiteness is in the body which is
by it made white. For when the body has been changed into another
color, that whiteness will not remain, but will altogether cease to
be. But if the Father who begat wisdom is also made wise by it, and
to be is not to Him the same as to be wise, then the Son is His
quality, not His offspring; and there will no longer be absolute
simplicity in the Godhead. But far be it from being so, since in
truth in the Godhead is absolutely simple essence, and therefore to
be is there the same as to be wise. But if to be is there the same
as to be wise, then the Father is not wise by that wisdom which He
begat; otherwise He did not beget it, but it begat Him. For what
else do we say when we say, that to Him to be is the same as to be
wise, unless that He is by that whereby He is wise? Wherefore, that
which is the cause to Him of being wise, is itself also the cause
to Him that He is; and accordingly, if the wisdom which He begat is
the cause to Him of being wise, it is also the cause to Him that He
is; and this cannot be the case, except either by begetting or by
creating Him. But no one ever said in any sense that wisdom is
either the begetter or the creator of the Father; for what could be
more senseless? Therefore both the Father Himself is wisdom, and
the Son is in such way called the wisdom of the Father, as He is
called the light of the Father; that is, that in the same manner as
light from light, and yet both one light, so we are to understand
wisdom of wisdom, and yet both one wisdom; and therefore also one
essence, since, in God, to be, is the same as to be wise. For what
to be wise is to wisdom, and to be able is to power, and to be
eternal is to eternity, and to be just to justice, and to be great
to greatness, that being itself is to essence. And since in the
Divine simplicity, to be wise is nothing else than to be, therefore
wisdom there is the same as essence.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ix.ii-p2">3. Therefore the Father and the Son
together are one essence, and one greatness, and one truth, and one
wisdom. But the Father and Son both together are not one Word,
because both together are not one Son. For as the Son is referred
to the Father, and is not so called in respect to Himself, so also
the Word is referred to him whose Word it is, when it is called the
Word. Since He is the Son in that He is the Word, and He is the
Word in that He is the Son. Inasmuch, therefore, as the Father and
the Son together are certainly not one Son, it follows that the
Father and the Son together are not the one Word of both. And
therefore He is not the Word in that He is wisdom; since He is not
called the Word in respect to Himself, but only relatively to Him
whose Word He is, as He is called the Son in relation to the
Father; but He is wisdom by that whereby He is essence. And
therefore, because one essence, one wisdom. But since the Word is
also wisdom, yet is not thereby the Word because He is wisdom for
He is understood to be the Word relatively, but wisdom essentially:
let us understand, that when He is called the Word, it is meant,
wisdom that is <i>born</i>, so as to be both the Son and the Image;
and that when these two words are used, namely <i>wisdom</i>
(<i>is</i>) <i>born</i>, in one of the two, namely <i>born</i>,<note place="end" n="629" id="iv.i.ix.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.ix.ii-p3"> [Augustin sometimes denominates

Father; God of God, Light of Light, Essence of
Essence.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> both Word,
and Image, and Son, are understood, and in all these names essence
is not expressed, since they are spoken relatively; but in the
other word, namely <i>wisdom</i>, since it is spoken also in
respect to substance, for wisdom is wise in itself, essence also is
expressed, and that being of His which is to be wise. Whence the
Father and Son together are one wisdom, because one essence, and
singly wisdom of wisdom, as essence of essence. And hence they are
not therefore not one essence, because the Father is not the Son,
and the Son is not the Father, or because the Father is
un-begotten, but the Son is begotten: since by these names only
their <i>relative</i> attributes are expressed. But both together
are one wisdom and one essence; in which to be, is the same as to
be wise. And both together are not the Word or the Son, since to be
is not the same as to be the Word or the Son, as we have already
sufficiently shown that these terms are spoken
relatively.</p>

or is thought before it is pronounced. For this word is completed
in certain spaces of time, but that is eternal, and speaks to us by
enlightening us, what ought to be spoken to men, both of itself and
of the Father. And therefore He says, &#8220;No man knoweth the Son,

it is not what the Father is; because the Word is not the Father,

anything concerning wisdom is declared or narrated in the
Scriptures, whether as itself speaking, or where anything is spoken
of it, the Son chiefly is intimated to us. And by the example of
Him who is the image, let us also not depart from God, since we
also are the Image of God: not indeed that which is equal to Him,
since we are made so by the Father through the Son, and not born of
the Father, as that is. And we are so, because we are enlightened
with light; but that is so, because it is the light that
enlightens; and which, therefore, being without pattern, is to us a
pattern. For He does not imitate any one going before Him, in
respect to the Father, from whom He is never separable at all,
since He is the very same substance with Him from whom He is. But
we by striving imitate Him who abides, and follow Him who stands

made for us a way in time by His humiliation, which is to us an
eternal abiding-place by His divinity. For since to pure
intellectual spirits, who have not fallen through pride, He gives
an example in the form of God and as equal with God and as God; so,
in order that He might also give Himself as an example of returning
to fallen man who on account of the uncleanness of sins and the
punishment of mortality cannot see God, &#8220;He emptied Himself;&#8221;

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p2">7. For the sake, then, of speaking
of things that cannot be uttered, that we may be able in some way
to utter what we are able in no way to utter fully, our Greek
friends have spoken of one essence, three substances; but the
Latins of one essence or substance, three persons; because, as we
have already said,<note place="end" n="646" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p3"> Bk. v. c. 28.</p></note> essence usually means nothing else
than substance in our language, that is, in Latin. And provided
that what is said is understood only in a mystery, such a way of
speaking was sufficient, in order that there might be something to
say when it was asked what the three are, which the true faith
pronounces to be three, when it both declares that the Father is
not the Son, and that the Holy Spirit, which is the gift of God, is
neither the Father nor the Son. When, then, it is asked what the
three are, or who the three are, we betake ourselves to the finding
out of some special or general name under which we may embrace
these three; and no such name occurs to the mind, because the
super-eminence of the Godhead surpasses the power of customary
speech. For God is more truly thought than He is altered, and
exists more truly than He is thought. For when we say that Jacob
was not the same as Abraham, but that Isaac was neither Abraham nor
Jacob, certainly we confess that they are three, Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob. But when it is asked what three, we reply three men,
calling them in the plural by a specific name; but if we were to
say three animals, then by a generic name; for man, as the ancients
have defined him, is a rational, mortal animal: or again, as our
Scriptures usually speak, three souls, since it is fitting to
denominate the whole from the better part, that is, to denominate
both body and soul, which is the whole man, from the soul; for so
it is said that seventy-five souls went down into Egypt with Jacob,
instead of saying so many men.<note place="end" n="647" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p4"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xlvi. 27" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p4.2" parsed="|Gen|46|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.46.27">Gen. xlvi. 27</scripRef>, and <scripRef passage="Deut. x. 22" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p4.3" parsed="|Deut|10|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.10.22">Deut. x.

is not mine, and that a third belonging to some one else is neither
mine nor yours, then we confess that there are three; and if any
one ask what three, we answer three horses by a specific name, but
three animals by a generic one. And yet again, when we say that an
ox is not a horse, but that a dog is neither an ox nor a horse, we
speak of a three; and if any one questions us what three, we do not
speak now by a specific name of three horses, or three oxen, or
three dogs, because the three are not contained under the same
species, but by a generic name, three animals; or if under a higher
genus, three substances, or three creatures, or three natures. But
whatsoever things are expressed in the plural number specifically
by one name, can also be expressed generically by one name. But all
things which are generically called by one name cannot also be
called specifically by one name. For three horses, which is a
specific name, we also call three animals; but, a horse, and an ox,
and a dog, we call only three animals or substances, which are
generic names, or anything else that can be spoken generically
concerning them; but we cannot speak of them as three horses, or
oxen, or dogs, which are specific names; for we express those
things by one name, although in the plural number, which have that
in common that is signified by the name. For Abraham, and Isaac,
and Jacob, have in common that which is man; therefore they are
called three men: a horse also, and an ox, and a dog, have in
common that which is animal; therefore they are called three
animals. So three several laurels we also call three trees; but a
laurel, and a myrtle, and an olive, we call only three trees, or
three substances, or three natures: and so three stones we call
also three bodies; but stone, and wood, and iron, we call only
three bodies, or by any other higher generic name by which they can
be called. Of the Father, therefore, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
seeing that they are three, let us ask what three they are, and
what they have in common. For the being the Father is not common to
them, so that they should be interchangeably fathers <pb n="110" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_110.html" id="iv.i.ix.iv-Page_110"/>to one
another: as friends, since they are so called relatively to each
other, can be called three friends, because they are so mutually to
each other. But this is not the case in the Trinity, since the
Father only is there father; and not Father of two, but of the Son
only. Neither are they three Sons, since the Father there is not
the Son, nor is the Holy Spirit. Neither three Holy Spirits,
because the Holy Spirit also, in that proper meaning by which He is
also called the gift of God, is neither the Father nor the Son.
What three therefore? For if three persons, then that which is
meant by person is common to them; therefore this name is either
specific or generic to them, according to the manner of speaking.
But where there is no difference of nature, there things that are
several in number are so expressed generically, that they can also
be expressed specifically. For the difference of nature causes,
that a laurel, and a myrtle, and an olive, or a horse, and an ox,
and a dog, are not called by the specific name, the former of three
laurels, or the latter of three oxen, but by the generic name, the
former of three trees, and the latter of three animals. But here,
where there is no difference of essence, it is necessary that these
three should have a specific name, which yet is not to be found.
For person is a generic name, insomuch that man also can be so
called, although there is so great a difference between man and
God.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p5">8. Further, in regard to that very
generic (<i>generalis</i>) word, if on this account we say three
persons, because that which person means is common to them
(otherwise they can in no way be so called, just as they are not
called three sons, because that which son means is not common to
them); why do we not also say three Gods? For certainly, since the
Father is a person, and the Son a person, and the Holy Spirit a
person, therefore there are three persons: since then the Father is
God, and the Son God, and the Holy Spirit God, why not three Gods?
Or else, since on account of their ineffable union these three are
together one God, why not also one person; so that we could not say
three persons, although we call each a person singly, just as we
cannot say three Gods, although we call each singly God, whether
the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit? Is it because Scripture
does not say three Gods? But neither do we find that Scripture
anywhere mentions three persons. Or is it because Scripture does
not call these three, either three persons or one person (for we
read of the person of the Lord, but not of the Lord as a person),
that therefore it was lawful through the mere necessity of speaking
and reasoning to say three persons, not because Scripture says it,
but because Scripture does not contradict it: whereas, if we were
to say three Gods, Scripture would contradict it, which says,
&#8220;Hear, O Israel; the Lord thy God is one God?&#8221;<note place="end" n="648" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p6"> <scripRef passage="Deut. vi. 4" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p6.2" parsed="|Deut|6|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.6.4">Deut. vi. 4</scripRef></p></note> Why then is
it not also lawful to say three essences; which, in like manner, as
Scripture does not say, so neither does it contradict? For if
essence is a specific (<i>specialis</i>) name common to three, why
are They not to be called three essences, as Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob are called three men, because man is the specific name common
to all men? But if essence is not a specific name, but a generic
one, since man, and cattle, and tree, and constellation, and angel,
are called essences; why are not these called three essences, as
three horses are called three animals, and three laurels are called
three trees, and three stones three bodies? Or if they are not
called three essences, but one essence, on account of the unity of
the Trinity, why is it not the case, that on account of the same
unity of the Trinity they are not to be called three substances or
three persons, but one substance and one person? For as the name of
essence is common to them, so that each singly is called essence,
so the name of either substance or person is common to them. For
that which must be understood of persons according to our usage,
this is to be understood of substances according to the Greek
usage; for they say three substances, one essence, in the same way
as we say three persons, one essence or substance.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p7">9. What therefore remains, except
that we confess that these terms sprang from the necessity of
speaking, when copious reasoning was required against the devices
or errors of the heretics? For when human weakness endeavored to
utter in speech to the senses of man what it grasps in the secret
places of the mind in proportion to its comprehension respecting
the Lord God its creator, whether by devout faith, or by any
discernment whatsoever; it feared to say three essences, lest any
difference should be understood to exist in that absolute equality.
Again, it could not say that there were not three somewhats
(<i>tria qu&#230;dam</i>), for it was because Sabellius said this that
he fell into heresy. For it must be devoutly believed, as most
certainly known from the Scriptures, and must be grasped by the
mental eye with undoubting perception, that there is both
<pb n="111" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_111.html" id="iv.i.ix.iv-Page_111"/>Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit; and that the Son is
not the same with the Father, nor the Holy Spirit the same with the
Father or the Son. It sought then what three it should call them,
and answered substances or persons; by which names it did not
intend diversity to be meant, but singleness to be denied: that not
only unity might be understood therein from the being called one
essence, but also Trinity from the being called three substances or
persons. For if it is the same thing with God to be (<i>esse</i>)
as to subsist (<i>subsistere</i>), they were not to be called three
substances, in such sense as they are not called three essences;
just as, because it is the same thing with God to be as to be wise,
as we do not say three essences, so neither three wisdoms. For so,
because it is the same thing to Him to be God as to be, it is not
right to say three essences, as it is not right to say three Gods.
But if it is one thing to God to be, another to subsist, as it is
one thing to God to be, another to be the Father or the Lord (for
that which He is, is spoken in respect to Himself, but He is called
Father in relation to the Son, and Lord in relation to the creature
which serves Him); therefore He subsists relatively, as He begets
relatively, and bears rule relatively: so then substance will be no
longer substance, because it will be relative. For as from being,
He is called essence, so from subsisting, we speak of substance.
But it is absurd that substance should be spoken relatively, for
everything subsists in respect to itself; how much more God?<note place="end" n="649" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p8"> [Augustin&#8217;s meaning is, that the
term &#8220;substance&#8221; is not an adequate one whereby to denote a
trinitarian distinction, because in order to denote such a
distinction it must be employed relatively, while in itself it has
an absolute signification. In the next chapter he proceeds to show
this.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ix.v-p2">10. If, however, it is fitting that
God should be said to subsist&#8212;(For this word is rightly applied
to those things, in which as subjects those things are, which are
said to be in a subject, as color or shape in body. For body
subsists, and so is substance; but those things are in the body,
which subsists and is their subject, and they are not substances,
but are in a substance: and so, if either that color or that shape
ceases to be, it does not deprive the body of being a body, because
it is not of the being of body, that it should retain this or that
shape or color; therefore neither changeable nor simple things are
properly called substances.)&#8212;If, I say, God subsists so that He
can be properly called a substance, then there is something in Him
as it were in a subject, and He is not simple, <i>i.e.</i> such
that to Him to be is the same as is anything else that is said
concerning Him in respect to Himself; as, for instance, great,
omnipotent, good, and whatever of this kind is not unfitly said of
God. But it is an impiety to say that God subsists, and is a
subject in relation to His own goodness, and that this goodness is
not a substance or rather essence, and that God Himself is not His
own goodness, but that it is in Him as in a subject. And hence it
is clear that God is improperly called substance, in order that He
may be understood to be, by the more usual name essence, which He
is truly and properly called; so that perhaps it is right that God
alone should be called essence. For He is truly alone, because He
is unchangeable; and declared this to be His own name to His
servant Moses, when He says, &#8220;I am that I am;&#8221; and, &#8220;Thus
shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: He who is hath sent me
unto you.&#8221;<note place="end" n="650" id="iv.i.ix.v-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.ix.v-p3"> <scripRef passage="Ex. iii. 14" id="iv.i.ix.v-p3.2" parsed="|Exod|3|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.3.14">Ex. iii. 14</scripRef></p></note> However,
whether He be called essence, which He is properly called, or
substance, which He is called improperly, He is called both in
respect to Himself, not relatively to anything; whence to God to be
is the same thing as to subsist; and so the Trinity, if one
essence, is also one substance. Perhaps therefore they are more
conveniently called three persons than three
substances.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ix.vi-p2">11. But lest I should seem to favor
ourselves [the Latins], let us make this further inquiry. Although
they [the Greeks] also, if they pleased, as they call three
substances three hypostases, so might call three persons three
&#8220;prosopa,&#8221; yet they preferred that word which, perhaps, was
more in accordance with the usage of their language. For the case
is the same with the word persons also; for to God it is not one
thing to be, another to be a person, but it is absolutely the same
thing. For if to be is said in respect to Himself, but person
relatively; in this way we should say three persons, the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit; just as we speak of three friends, or three
relations, or three neighbors, in that they are so mutually, not
that each one of them is so in respect to himself. Wherefore any
one of these is the friend of the other two, <pb n="112" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_112.html" id="iv.i.ix.vi-Page_112"/>or the
relation, or the neighbor, because these names have a relative
signification. What then? Are we to call the Father the person of
the Son and of the Holy Spirit, or the Son the person of the Father
and of the Holy Spirit, or the Holy Spirit the person of the Father
and of the Son? But neither is the word person commonly so used in
any case; nor in this Trinity, when we speak of the person of the
Father, do we mean anything else than the substance of the Father.
Wherefore, as the substance of the Father is the Father Himself,
not as He is the Father, but as He is, so also the person of the
Father is not anything else than the Father Himself; for He is
called a person in respect to Himself, not in respect to the Son,
or the Holy Spirit: just as He is called in respect to Himself both
God and great, and good, and just, and anything else of the kind;
and just as to Him to be is the same as to be God, or as to be
great, or as to be good, so it is the same thing to Him to be, as
to be a person. Why, therefore, do we not call these three together
one person, as one essence and one God, but say three persons,
while we do not say three Gods or three essences; unless it be
because we wish some one word to serve for that meaning whereby the
Trinity is understood, that we might not be altogether silent, when
asked, what three, while we confessed that they are three? For if
essence is the genus, and substance or person the species, as some
think, then I must omit what I just now said, that they ought to be
called three essences, as they are called three substances or
persons; as three horses are called three horses, and the same are
called three animals, since horse is the species, animal the genus.
For in this case the species is not spoken of in the plural, and
the genus in the singular, as if we were to say that three horses
were one animal; but as they are three horses by the special name,
so they are three animals by the generic one. But if they say that
the name of substance or person does not signify species, but
something singular and individual; so that any one is not so called
a substance or person as he is called a man, for man is common to
all men, but in the same manner as he is called this or that man,
as Abraham, as Isaac, as Jacob, or anyone else who, if present,
could be pointed out with the finger: so will the same reason reach
these too. For as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, are called three
individuals, so are they called three men, and three souls. Why
then are both the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, if we are
to reason about them also according to genus and species and
individual, not so called three essences, as they are called three
substances or persons? But this, as I said, I pass over: but I do
affirm, that if essence is a genus, then a single essence has no
species; just as, because animal is a genus, a single animal has no
species. Therefore the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not three
species of one essence. But if essence is a species, as man is a
species, but those are three which we call substances or persons,
then they have the same species in common, in such way as Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob have in common the species which is called man;
not as man is subdivided into Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, so can one
man also be subdivided into several single men; for this is
altogether impossible, since one man is already a single man. Why
then is one essence subdivided into three substances or persons?
For if essence is a species, as man is, then one essence is as one
man is: or do we, as we say that any three human beings of the same
sex, of the same constitution of body, of the same mind, are one
nature,&#8212;for they are three human beings, but one nature,&#8212;so
also say in the Trinity three substances one essence, or three
persons one substance or essence? But this is somehow a parallel
case, since the ancients also who spoke Latin, before they had
these terms, which have not long come into use, that is, essence or
substance, used for them to say nature. We do not therefore use
these terms according to genus or species, but as if according to a
matter that is common and the same. Just as if three statues were
made of the same gold, we should say three statues one gold, yet
should neither call the gold genus, and the statues species; nor
the gold species, and the statues individuals. For no species goes
beyond its own individuals, so as to comprehend anything external
to them. For when I define what man is, which is a specific name,
every several man that exists is contained in the same individual
definition, neither does anything belong to it which is not a man.
But when I define gold, not statues alone, if they be gold, but
rings also, and anything else that is made of gold, will belong to
gold; and even if nothing were made of it, it would still be called
gold; since, even if there were no gold statues, there will not
therefore be no statues at all. Likewise no species goes beyond the
definition of its genus. For when I define animal, since horse is a
species of this genus, every horse is an animal; but every statue
is not gold. So, although in the case of three golden statues we
should rightly say three statues, one gold; yet we do not so say
it, as to understand gold to be the genus, and the statues to be
species. Therefore neither do we so call the Trinity <pb n="113" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_113.html" id="iv.i.ix.vi-Page_113"/>three
persons or substances, one essence and one God, as though three
somethings subsisted out of one matter [leaving a remainder, <i>i.
e.</i>]; although whatever that is, it is unfolded in these three.
For there is nothing else of that essence besides the Trinity. Yet
we say three persons of the same essence, or three persons one
essence; but we do not say three persons out of the same essence,
as though therein essence were one thing, and person another, as we
can say three statues out of the same gold; for there it is one
thing to be gold, another to be statues. And when we say three men
one nature, or three men of the same nature, they also can be
called three men out of the same nature, since out of the same
nature there can be also three other such men. But in that essence
of the Trinity, in no way can any other person whatever exist out
of the same essence. Further, in these things, one man is not as
much as three men together; and two men are something more than one
man: and in equal statues, three together amount to more of gold
than each singly, and one amounts to less of gold than two. But in
God it is not so; for the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
together is not a greater essence than the Father alone or the Son
alone; but these three substances or persons, if they must be so
called, together are equal to each singly: which the natural man
does not comprehend. For he cannot think except under the
conditions of bulk and space, either small or great, since
phantasms or as it were images of bodies flit about in his
mind.</p>

when he is told that the Father only is God, let him not separate

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.i-p2"><span class="c19" id="iv.i.x.i-p2.1">We</span> have
said elsewhere that those things are predicated specially in the
Trinity as belonging severally to each person, which are predicated
relatively the one to the other, as Father and Son, and the gift of
both, the Holy Spirit; for the Father is not the Trinity, nor the
Son the Trinity, nor the gift the Trinity: but what whenever each
is singly spoken of in respect to themselves, then they are not
spoken of as three in the plural number, but one, the Trinity
itself, as the Father God, the Son God, and the Holy Spirit God;
the Father good, the Son good, and the Holy Spirit good; and the
Father omnipotent, the Son omnipotent, and the Holy Spirit
omnipotent: yet neither three Gods, nor three goods, nor three
omnipotents, but one God, good, omnipotent, the Trinity itself; and
whatsoever else is said of them not relatively in respect to each
other, but individually in respect to themselves. For they are thus
spoken of according to essence, since in them to be is the same as
to be great, as to be good, as to be wise, and whatever else is
said of each person individually therein, or of the Trinity itself,
in respect to themselves. And that therefore they are called three
persons, or three substances, not in order that any difference of
essence may be understood, but that we may be able to answer by
some one word, should any one ask what three, or what three things?
And that there is so great an equality in that Trinity, that not
only the Father is not greater than the Son, as regards divinity,
but neither are the Father and Son together greater than the Holy
Spirit; nor is each individual person, whichever it be of the
three, less than the Trinity itself. This is what we have said; and
if it is handled and repeated frequently, it becomes, no doubt,
more familiarly known: yet some limit, too, must be put to the
discussion, and we must supplicate God with most devout piety, that
He will open our understanding, and take away the inclination of
disputing, in order that our minds may discern the essence of the
truth, that has neither bulk nor moveableness. Now, therefore, so
far as the Creator Himself aids us in His marvellous mercy, let us
consider these subjects, into which we will enter more deeply than
we entered into those which preceded, although they are in truth
the same; preserving the while this rule, that what has not yet
been made clear to our intellect, be nevertheless not loosened from
the firmness of our faith.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.ii-p2">2. For we say that in this Trinity
two or three persons are not anything greater than one of them;
which carnal perception does not receive, for no other reason
except because it perceives as it can the true things which are
created, but cannot discern the truth itself by which they are
created; for if it could, then the very corporeal light would in no
way be more clear than this which we have said. For in respect to
the substance of truth, since it alone truly is, nothing is
greater, unless because it more truly is.<note place="end" n="662" id="iv.i.x.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.x.ii-p3"> [In this and the following
chapter, the meaning of Augustin will be clearer, if the Latin
&#8220;<i>veritas</i>,&#8221; &#8220;<i>vera</i>,&#8221; and &#8220;<i>vere</i>,&#8221; are
rendered occasionally, by &#8220;reality,&#8221; &#8220;real,&#8221; and
&#8220;really.&#8221; He is endeavoring to prove the equality of the three
persons, by the fact that they are equally real (true), and the
degree of their reality (truth) is the same. Real being is true
being; reality is truth. In common phraseology, truth and reality
are synonymous.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> But in respect to whatsoever is
intelligible and unchangeable, no one thing is more truly than
another, since all alike are unchangeably eternal; and that which
therein is called great, is not great from any other source than
from that by which it truly is. Wherefore, where magnitude itself
is truth, whatsoever has more of magnitude must needs have more of
truth; whatsoever therefore has not more of truth, has not also
more of magnitude. Further, whatsoever has more of truth is
certainly more true, just as that is greater which has more of
magnitude; therefore in respect to the substance of truth that is
more great which is more true. But the Father and the Son together
are not more truly than the Father singly, or the Son singly. Both
together, therefore, are not anything greater than each of them
singly. And since also the Holy Spirit equally is truly, the Father
and Son together are not anything greater than He, since neither
are they more truly. The Father also and the Holy Spirit together,
since they do not surpass the Son in truth (for they are not more
truly), do not surpass Him either in magnitude. And so the Son and
the Holy Spirit together are just as great as the Father alone,
since they are as truly. So also the Trinity itself is as great as
each several person therein. For where truth itself is magnitude,
that is not more great which is not more true: since in regard to
the essence of truth, to be true is the same as to be, and to be is
the same as to be great; therefore to be great is the same as to be
true. And in regard to it, therefore, what is equally true must
needs also be equally great.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.iii-p2">3. But in respect to bodies, it may
be the case that this gold and that gold may be equally true
[real], but this may be greater than that, since magnitude is not
the same thing in this case as truth; and it is one thing for it to
be gold, another to be great. So also in the nature of the soul; a
soul is not called great in the same respect in which it is called
true. For he, too, has a true [real] soul who has not a great soul;
since the essence of body and soul is not the essence of the truth
[reality] itself; as is the Trinity, one God, alone, great, true,
truthful, the truth. Of whom if we endeavor to think, so far as He
Himself permits and grants, let us not think of any touch or
embrace in local space, as if of three bodies, or of any
compactness of conjunction, as fables tell of three-bodied Geryon;
but let whatsoever may occur to the mind, that is of such sort as
to be greater in three than in each singly, and less in one than in
two, be rejected without any doubt; for so everything corporeal is
rejected. But also in spiritual things let nothing changeable that
may have occurred to the mind be thought of God. For when we aspire
from this depth to that height, it is a step towards no small
knowledge, if, before we can know what God is, we can already know
what He is not. For certainly He is neither earth nor heaven; nor,
as it were, earth and heaven; nor any such thing as we see in the
heaven; nor any such thing as we do not see, but which perhaps is
in heaven. Neither if you were to magnify in the imagination of

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.x.iv-p1.1">Chapter 3.&#8212;How God May Be Known to Be the Chief Good.
The Mind Does Not Become Good Unless by Turning to God.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.iv-p2">4. Behold again, and see if thou
canst. Thou certainly dost not love anything except what is good,
since good is the earth, with the loftiness of its mountains, and
the due measure of its hills, and the level surface of its plains;
and good is an estate that is pleasant and fertile; and good is a
house that is arranged in due proportions, and is spacious and
bright; and good are animal and animate bodies; and good is air
that is temperate, and salubrious; and good is food that is
agreeable and fit for health; and good is health, without pains or
lassitude; and good is the countenance of man that is disposed in
fit proportions, and is cheerful in look, and bright in color; and
good is the mind of a friend, with the sweetness of agreement, and
with the confidence of love; and good is a righteous man; and good
are riches, since they are readily useful; and good is the heaven,
with its sun, and moon, and stars; and good are the angels, by
their holy obedience; and good is discourse that sweetly teaches
and suitably admonishes the hearer; and good is a poem that is
harmonious in its numbers and weighty in its sense. And why add yet
more and more? This thing is good and that good, but take away this
and that, and regard good itself if thou canst; so wilt thou see
God, not good by a good that is other than Himself, but the good of
all good. For in all these good things, whether those which I have
mentioned, or any else that are to be discerned or thought, we
could not say that one was better than another, when we judge
truly, unless a conception of the good itself had been impressed
upon us, such that according to it we might both approve some
things as good, and prefer one good to another. So God is to be
loved, not this and that good, but the good itself. For the good
that must be sought for the soul is not one above which it is to
fly by judging, but to which it is to cleave by loving; and what
can this be except God? Not a good mind, or a good angel, or the
good heaven, but the good good. For perhaps what I wish to say may
be more easily perceived in this way. For when, for instance, a
mind is called good, as there are two words, so from these words I
understand two things&#8212;one whereby it is mind, and another whereby
it is good. And itself had no share in making itself a mind, for
there was nothing as yet to make itself to be anything; but to make
itself to be a good mind, I see, must be brought about by the will:
not because that by which it is mind is not itself anything
good;&#8212;for how else is it already called, and most truly called,
better than the body?&#8212;but it is not yet called a good mind, for
this reason, that the action of the will still is wanted, by which
it is to become more excellent; and if it has neglected this, then
it is justly blamed, and is rightly called not a good mind. For it
then differs from the mind which does perform this; and since the
latter is praiseworthy, the former doubtless, which does not
perform, it is blameable. But when it does this of set purpose, and
becomes a good mind, it yet cannot attain to being so unless it
turn itself to something which itself is not. And to what can it
turn itself that it may become a good mind, except to the good
which it loves, and seeks, and obtains? And if it turns itself back
again from this, and becomes not good, then by the very act of
turning away from the good, unless that good remain in it from
which it turns away, it cannot again turn itself back thither if it
should wish to amend.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.iv-p3">5. Wherefore there would be no
changeable goods, unless there were the unchangeable good. Whenever
then thou art told of this good thing and that good thing, which
things can also in other respects be called not good, if thou canst
put aside those things which are good by the participation of the
good, and discern that good itself by the participation of which
they are good (for when this or that good thing is spoken of, thou
understandest together with them the good itself also): if, then, I
say thou canst remove these things, and canst discern the good in
itself, then thou wilt have discerned God. And if thou shalt cleave
to Him with love, thou shalt be forthwith blessed. But whereas
other things are not loved, except because they are good,
<pb n="118" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_118.html" id="iv.i.x.iv-Page_118"/>be
ashamed, in cleaving to them, not to love the good itself whence
they are good. That also, which is a mind, only because it is a
mind, while it is not yet also good by the turning itself to the
unchangeable good, but, as I said, is only a mind; whenever it so
pleases us, as that we prefer it even, if we understand aright, to
all corporeal light, does not please us in itself, but in that
skill by which it was made. For it is thence approved as made,
wherein it is seen to have been to be made. This is truth, and
simple good: for it is nothing else than the good itself, and for
this reason also the chief good. For no good can be diminished or
increased, except that which is good from some other good.
Therefore the mind turns itself, in order to be good, to that by
which it comes to be a mind. Therefore the will is then in harmony
with nature, so that the mind may be perfected in good, when that
good is loved by the turning of the will to it, whence that other
good also comes which is not lost by the turning away of the will
from it. For by turning itself from the chief good, the mind loses
the being a good mind; but it does not lose the being a mind. And
this, too, is a good already, and one better than the body. The
will, therefore, loses that which the will obtains. For the mind
already was, that could wish to be turned to that from which it
was: but that as yet was not, that could wish to be before it was.
And herein is our [supreme] good, when we see whether the thing
ought to be or to have been, respecting which we comprehend that it
ought to be or to have been, and when we see that the thing could
not have been unless it ought to have been, of which we also do not
comprehend in what manner it ought to have been. This good then is
not far from every one of us: for in it we live, and move, and have
our being.<note place="end" n="667" id="iv.i.x.iv-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.x.iv-p4"> <scripRef passage="Acts xvii. 27, 28" id="iv.i.x.iv-p4.2" parsed="|Acts|17|27|17|28" osisRef="Bible:Acts.17.27-Acts.17.28">Acts xvii. 27, 28</scripRef></p></note></p>

mind believing what it does not yet see, and hoping and loving what

believed, can be loved. But indisputably we must take care, lest
the mind believing that which it does not see, feign to itself
something which is not, and hope for and love that which is false.
For in that case, it will not be charity out of a pure heart, and
of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned, which is the end of
the commandment, as the same apostle says.<note place="end" n="672" id="iv.i.x.v-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.x.v-p7"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. i. 5" id="iv.i.x.v-p7.2" parsed="|1Tim|1|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.1.5">1 Tim. i. 5</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.v-p8">7. But it must needs be, that, when
by reading or hearing of them we believe in any corporeal things
which we have not seen, the mind frames for itself something under
bodily features and forms, just as it may occur to our thoughts;
which either is not true, or even if it be true, which can most
rarely happen, yet this is of no benefit to us to believe in by
faith, but it is useful for some other purpose, which is intimated
by means of it. For who is there that reads or hears what the
Apostle Paul has written, or what has been written of him, that
does not imagine to himself the countenance both of the apostle
himself, and of all those whose names are there mentioned? And
whereas, among such a multitude of men to whom these books are
known, each imagines in a different way those bodily features and
forms, it is assuredly uncertain which it is that imagines them
more nearly and more like the reality. Nor, indeed, is our faith
busied therein with the bodily countenance of those men; but only
that by the grace of God they so lived and so acted as that
Scripture witnesses: this it is which it is both useful to believe,
and which must not be despaired of, and must be sought. For even
the countenance of our Lord Himself in the flesh is variously
fancied by the diversity of countless imaginations, which yet was
one, whatever it was. Nor in our faith which we have of our
<pb n="119" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_119.html" id="iv.i.x.v-Page_119"/>Lord
Jesus Christ, is that wholesome which the mind imagines for itself,
perhaps far other than the reality, but that which we think of man
according to his kind: for we have a notion of human nature
implanted in us, as it were by rule, according to which we know
forthwith, that whatever such thing we see is a man or the form of
a man.</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.x.vi-p1.1">Chapter 5.&#8212;How the Trinity May Be Loved Though
Unknown.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.vi-p2">Our conception is framed according
to this notion, when we believe that God was made man for us, as an
example of humility, and to show the love of God towards us. For
this it is which it is good for us to believe, and to retain firmly
and unshakenly in our heart, that the humility by which God was
born of a woman, and was led to death through contumelies so great
by mortal men, is the chiefest remedy by which the swelling of our
pride may be cured, and the profound mystery by which the bond of
sin may be loosed. So also, because we know what omnipotence is, we
believe concerning the omnipotent God in the power of His miracles
and of His resurrection, and we frame conceptions respecting
actions of this kind, according to the species and genera of things
that are either ingrafted in us by nature, or gathered by
experience, that our faith may not be feigned. For neither do we
know the countenance of the Virgin Mary; from whom, untouched by a
husband, nor tainted in the birth itself, He was wonderfully born.
Neither have we seen what were the lineaments of the body of
Lazarus; nor yet Bethany; nor the sepulchre, and that stone which
He commanded to be removed when He raised Him from the dead; nor
the new tomb cut out in the rock, whence He Himself arose; nor the
Mount of Olives, from whence He ascended into heaven. And, in
short, whoever of us have not seen these things, know not whether
they are as we conceive them to be, nay judge them more probably
not to be so. For when the aspect either of a place, or a man, or
of any other body, which we happened to imagine before we saw it,
turns out to be the same when it occurs to our sight as it was when
it occurred to our mind, we are moved with no little wonder. So
scarcely and hardly ever does it happen. And yet we believe those
things most steadfastly, because we imagine them according to a
special and general notion, of which we are certain. For we believe
our Lord Jesus Christ to be born of a virgin who was called Mary.
But what a virgin is, or what it is to be born, and what is a
proper name, we do not believe, but certainly know. And whether
that was the countenance of Mary which occurred to the mind in
speaking of those things or recollecting them, we neither know at
all, nor believe. It is allowable, then, in this case to say
without violation of the faith, perhaps she had such or such a
countenance, perhaps she had not: but no one could say without
violation of the Christian faith, that perhaps Christ was born of a
virgin.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.vi-p3">8. Wherefore, since we desire to
understand the eternity, and equality, and unity of the Trinity, as
much as is permitted us, but ought to believe before we understand;
and since we must watch carefully, that our faith be not feigned;
since we must have the fruition of the same Trinity, that we may
live blessedly; but if we have believed anything false of it, our
hope would be worthless, and our charity not pure: how then can we
love, by believing, that Trinity which we do not know? Is it
according to the special or general notion, according to which we
love the Apostle Paul? In whose case, even if he was not of that
countenance which occurs to us when we think of him (and this we do
not know at all), yet we know what a man is. For not to go far
away, this <i>we</i> are; and it is manifest he, too, was this, and
that his soul joined to his body lived after the manner of mortals.
Therefore we believe this of him, which we find in ourselves,
according to the species or genus under which all human nature
alike is comprised. What then do we know, whether specially or
generally, of that most excellent Trinity, as if there were many
such trinities, some of which we had learned by experience, so that
we may believe that Trinity, too, to have been such as they,
through the rule of similitude, impressed upon us, whether a
special or a general notion; and thus love also that thing which we
believe and do not yet know, from the parity of the thing which we
do know? But this certainly is not so. Or is it that, as we love in
our Lord Jesus Christ, that He rose from the dead, although we
never saw any one rise from thence, so we can believe in and love
the Trinity which we do not see, and the like of which we never
have seen? But we certainly know what it is to die, and what it is
to live; because we both live, and from time to time have seen and
experienced both dead and dying persons. And what else is it to
rise again, except to live again, that is, to return to life from
death? When, therefore, we say and believe that there is a Trinity,
we know what a Trinity is, because we know what three are; but this
is not what we love. For we can easily have this whenever we will,
to pass over other things, by just hold<pb n="120" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_120.html" id="iv.i.x.vi-Page_120"/>ing up three
fingers. Or do we indeed love, not every trinity, but <i>the</i>
Trinity, that is God? We love then in the Trinity, that it is God:
but we never saw or knew any other God, because God is One; He
alone whom we have not yet seen, and whom we love by believing. But
the question is, from what likeness or comparison of known things
can we believe, in order that we may love God, whom we do not yet
know?</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.x.vii-p1.1">Chapter 6.&#8212;How the
Man Not Yet Righteous Can Know the Righteous Man Whom He
Loves.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.vii-p2">9. Return then with me, and let us
consider why we love the apostle. Is it at all on account of his
human kind, which we know right well, in that we believe him to
have been a man? Assuredly not; for if it were so, he now is not
him whom we love, since he is no longer that man, for his soul is
separated from his body. But we believe that which we love in him
to be still living, for we love his righteous mind. From what
general or special rule then, except that we know both what a mind
is, and what it is to be righteous? And we say, indeed, not
unfitly, that we therefore know what a mind is, because we too have
a mind. For neither did we ever see it with our eyes, and gather a
special or general notion from the resemblance of more minds than
one, which we had seen; but rather, as I have said before, because
we too have it. For what is known so intimately, and so perceives
itself to be itself, as that by which also all other things are
perceived, that is, the mind itself? For we recognize the movements
of bodies also, by which we perceive that others live besides
ourselves, from the resemblance of ourselves; since we also so move
our body in living as we observe those bodies to be moved. For even
when a living body is moved, there is no way opened to our eyes to
see the mind, a thing which cannot be seen by the eyes; but we
perceive something to be contained in that bulk, such as is
contained in ourselves, so as to move in like manner our own bulk,
which is the life and the soul. Neither is this, as it were, the
property of human foresight and reason, since brute animals also
perceive that not only they themselves live, but also other brute
animals interchangeably, and the one the other, and that we
ourselves do so. Neither do they see our souls, save from the
movements of the body, and that immediately and most easily by some
natural agreement. Therefore we both know the mind of any one from
our own, and believe also from our own of him whom we do not know.
For not only do we perceive that there is a mind, but we can also
know what a mind is, by reflecting upon our own: for we have a
mind. But whence do we know what a righteous man is? For we said
above that we love the apostle for no other reason except that he
is a righteous mind. We know, then, what a righteous man also is,
just as we know what a mind is. But what a mind is, as has been
said, we know from ourselves, for there is a mind in us. But whence
do we know what a righteous man is, if we are not righteous? But if
no one but he who is righteous knows what is a righteous man, no
one but a righteous man loves a righteous man; for one cannot love
him whom one believes to be righteous, for this very reason that
one does believe him to be righteous, if one does not know what it
is to be righteous; according to that which we have shown above,
that no one loves what he believes and does not see, except by some
rule of a general or special notion. And if for this reason no one
but a righteous man loves a righteous man, how will any one wish to
be a righteous man who is not yet so? For no one wishes to be that
which he does not love. But, certainly, that he who is not
righteous may be so, it is necessary that he should wish to be
righteous; and in order that he may wish to be righteous, he loves
the righteous man. Therefore, even he who is not yet righteous,
loves the righteous man.<note place="end" n="673" id="iv.i.x.vii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.x.vii-p3"> [The &#8220;wish&#8221; and &#8220;love&#8221;
which Augustin here attributes to the non-righteous man is not true
and spiritual, but selfish. In chapter vii. 10, he speaks of true
love as distinct from that kind of desire which is a mere wish. The
latter he calls <i>cupiditas</i>. &#8220;That is to be called love
which is true, otherwise it is desire (<i>cupiditas</i>); and so
those who desire (<i>cupidi</i>) are improperly said to love
(<i>diligere</i>), just as they who love (<i>diligunt</i>) are said
improperly to desire (<i>cupere</i>).&#8221;&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> But he cannot love the righteous
man, who is ignorant what a righteous man is. Accordingly, even he
who is not yet righteous, knows what a righteous man is. Whence
then does he know this? Does he see it with his eyes? Is any
corporeal thing righteous, as it is white, or black, or square, or
round? Who could say this? Yet with one&#8217;s eyes one has seen
nothing except corporeal things. But there is nothing righteous in
a man except the mind; and when a man is called a righteous man, he
is called so from the mind, not from the body. For righteousness is
in some sort the beauty of the mind, by which men are beautiful;
very many too who are misshapen and deformed in body. And as the
mind is not seen with the eyes, so neither is its beauty. From
whence then does he who is not yet righteous know what a righteous
man is, and love the righteous man that he may become righteous? Do
certain signs shine forth by the motion of the body, by
<pb n="121" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_121.html" id="iv.i.x.vii-Page_121"/>which
this or that man is manifested to be righteous? But whence does any
one know that these are the signs of a righteous mind when he is
wholly ignorant what it is to be righteous? Therefore he does know.
But whence do we know what it is to be righteous, even when we are
not yet righteous? If we know from without ourselves, we know it by
some bodily thing. But this is not a thing of the body. Therefore
we know in ourselves what it is to be righteous. For I find this
nowhere else when I seek to utter it, except within myself; and if
I ask another what it is to be righteous, he seeks within himself
what to answer; and whosoever hence can answer truly, he has found
within himself what to answer. And when indeed I wish to speak of
Carthage, I seek within myself what to speak, and I find within
myself a notion or image of Carthage; but I have received this
through the body, that is, through the perception of the body,
since I have been present in that city in the body, and I saw and
perceived it, and retained it in my memory, that I might find
within myself a word concerning it, whenever I might wish to speak
of it. For its word is the image itself of it in my memory, not
that sound of two syllables when Carthage is named, or even when
that name itself is thought of silently from time to time, but that
which I discern in my mind, when I utter that dissyllable with my
voice, or even before I utter it. So also, when I wish to speak of
Alexandria, which I never saw, an image of it is present with me.
For whereas I had heard from many and had believed that city to be
great, in such way as it could be told me, I formed an image of it
in my mind as I was able; and this is with me its word when I wish
to speak of it, before I utter with my voice the five syllables
which make the name that almost every one knows. And yet if I could
bring forth that image from my mind to the eyes of men who know
Alexandria, certainly all either would say, It is not it; or if
they said, It is, I should greatly wonder; and as I gazed at it in
my mind, that is, at the image which was as it were its picture, I
should yet not know it to be it, but should believe those who
retained an image they had seen. But I do not so ask what it is to
be righteous, nor do I so find it, nor do I so gaze upon it, when I
utter it; neither am I so approved when I am heard, nor do I so
approve when I hear; as though I have seen such a thing with my
eyes, or learned it by some perception of the body, or heard it
from those who had so learned it. For when I say, and say
knowingly, that mind is righteous which knowingly and of purpose
assigns to every one his due in life and behavior, I do not think
of anything absent, as Carthage, or imagine it as I am able, as
Alexandria, whether it be so or not; but I discern something
present, and I discern it within myself, though I myself am not
that which I discern; and many if they hear will approve it. And
whoever hears me and knowingly approves, he too discerns this same
thing within himself, even though he himself be not what he
discerns. But when a righteous man says this, he discerns
and <pb n="122" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_122.html" id="iv.i.x.vii-Page_122"/>says that which he himself is. And whence also does he
discern it, except within himself? But this is not to be wondered
at; for whence should he discern himself except within himself? The
wonderful thing is, that the mind should see within itself that
which it has seen nowhere else, and should see truly, and should
see the very true righteous mind, and should itself be a mind, and
yet not a righteous mind, which nevertheless it sees within itself.
Is there another mind that is righteous in a mind that is not yet
righteous? Or if there is not, what does it there see when it sees
and says what is a righteous mind, nor sees it anywhere else but in
itself, when itself is not a righteous mind? Is that which it sees
an inner truth present to the mind which has power to behold it?
Yet all have not that power; and they who have power to behold it,
are not all also that which they behold, that is, they are not also
righteous minds themselves, just as they are able to see and to say
what is a righteous mind. And whence will they be able to be so,
except by cleaving to that very same form itself which they behold,
so that from thence they may be formed and may be righteous minds;
not only discerning and saying that the mind is righteous which
knowingly and of purpose assigns to every one that which is his due
in life and behavior, but so likewise that they themselves may live
righteously and be righteous in character, by assigning to every
one that which is his due, so as to owe no man anything, but to
love one another.<note place="end" n="674" id="iv.i.x.vii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.x.vii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Rom. xiii. 8" id="iv.i.x.vii-p4.2" parsed="|Rom|13|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.13.8">Rom. xiii. 8</scripRef></p></note> And whence
can any one cleave to that form but by loving it? Why then do we
love another whom we believe to be righteous, and do not love that
form itself wherein we see what is a righteous mind, that we also
may be able to be righteous? Is it that unless we loved that also,
we should not love him at all, whom through it we love; but whilst
we are not righteous, we love that form too little to allow of our
being able to be righteous? The man therefore who is believed to be
righteous, is loved through that form and truth which he who loves
discerns and understands within himself; but that very form and
truth itself cannot be loved from any other source than itself. For
we do not find any other such thing besides itself, so that by
believing we might love it when it is unknown, in that we here
already know another such thing. For whatsoever of such a kind one
may have seen, is itself; and there is not any other such thing,
since itself alone is such as itself is. He therefore who loves
men, ought to love them either because they are righteous, or that
they may become righteous. For so also he ought to love himself,
either because he is righteous, or that he may become righteous;
for in this way he loves his neighbor as himself without any risk.
For he who loves himself otherwise, loves himself wrongfully, since
he loves himself to this end that he may be unrighteous; therefore
to this end that he may be wicked; and hence it follows next that
he does not love himself; for, &#8220;He who loveth iniquity,<note place="end" n="675" id="iv.i.x.vii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.x.vii-p5"> Violence&#8212;A.V.</p></note> hateth his

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.viii-p11">11. Wherefore they who seek God
through those Powers which rule over the world, or parts of the
world, are removed and cast away far from Him; not by intervals of
space, but by difference of affections: for they endeavor to find a
path outwardly, and forsake their own inward things, within which
is God. Therefore, even although they may either have heard some
holy heavenly Power, or in some way or another may have thought of
it, yet they rather covet its deeds at which human weakness
marvels, but do not imitate the piety by which divine rest is
acquired. For they prefer, through pride, to be able to do that
which an angel does, more than, through devotion, to be that which
an angel is. For no holy being rejoices in his own power, but in
His from whom he has the power which he fitly can have; and he
knows it to be more a mark of power to be united to the Omnipotent
by a pious will, than to be able, by his own power and will, to do
what they may tremble at who are not able to do such things.
Therefore the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, in doing such things, in
order that He might teach better things to those who marvelled at
them, and might turn those who were intent and in doubt about
unusual temporal things to eternal and inner things, says, &#8220;Come
unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest. Take my yoke upon you.&#8221; And He does not say, Learn of me,
because I raise those <pb n="123" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_123.html" id="iv.i.x.viii-Page_123"/>who have been dead four days;
but He says, &#8220;Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart.&#8221;

pride, that is most inflated. And so He goes on to say, &#8220;And ye

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.ix-p2">12. Let no one say, I do not know
what I love. Let him love his brother, and he will love the same
love. For he knows the love with which he loves, more than the
brother whom he loves. So now he can know God more than he knows
his brother: clearly known more, because more present; known more,
because more within him; known more, because more certain. Embrace
the love of God, and by love embrace God. That is love itself,
which associates together all good angels and all the servants of
God by the bond of sanctity, and joins together us and them
mutually with ourselves, and joins us subordinately to Himself. In
proportion, therefore, as we are healed from the swelling of pride,
in such proportion are we more filled with love; and with what is
he full, who is full of love, except with God? Well, but you will
say, I see love, and, as far as I am able, I gaze upon it with my
mind, and I believe the Scripture, saying, that &#8220;God is love; and
he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God;&#8221;<note place="end" n="691" id="iv.i.x.ix-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.x.ix-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 John iv. 16" id="iv.i.x.ix-p3.2" parsed="|1John|4|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.4.16">1 John iv. 16</scripRef></p></note> but when I see love, I do not see
in it the Trinity. Nay, but thou dost see the Trinity if thou seest
love. But if I can I will put you in mind, that thou mayest see
that thou seest it; only let itself be present, that we may be
moved by love to something good. Since, when we love love, we love
one who loves something, and that on account of this very thing,
that he does love something; therefore what does love love, that
love itself also may be loved? For that is not love which loves
nothing. But if it loves itself it must love something, that it may
love itself as love. For as a word indicates something, and
indicates also itself, but does not indicate itself to be a word,
unless it indicates that it does indicate something; so love also
loves indeed itself, but except it love itself as loving something,
it loves itself not as love. What therefore does love love, except
that which we love with love? But this, to begin from that which is
nearest to us, is our brother. And listen how greatly the Apostle
John commends brotherly love: &#8220;He that loveth his brother abideth
in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.&#8221;<note place="end" n="692" id="iv.i.x.ix-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.x.ix-p4"> <scripRef passage="1 John ii. 10" id="iv.i.x.ix-p4.2" parsed="|1John|2|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.2.10">1 John ii. 10</scripRef></p></note> It is
manifest that he placed the perfection of righteousness in the love
of our brother; for he certainly is perfect in whom &#8220;there is no
occasion of stumbling.&#8221; And yet he seems to have passed by the
love of God in silence; which he never would have done, unless
because he intends God to be understood in brotherly love itself.
For in this same epistle, a little further on, he says most plainly
thus: &#8220;Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and
every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that
loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.&#8221; And this passage
declares sufficiently and plainly, that this same brotherly love
itself (for that is brotherly love by which we love each other) is
set forth by so great authority, not only to be from God, but also
to be God. When, therefore, we love our brother from love, we love
our brother from God; neither can it be that we do not love above
all else that same love by which we love our brother: whence it may
be gathered that these two commandments cannot exist unless
interchangeably. For since &#8220;God is love,&#8221; he who loves love
certainly loves God; but he must needs love love, who loves his
brother. And so a little after he says, &#8220;For he that loveth not
his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not
seen&#8221;?<note place="end" n="693" id="iv.i.x.ix-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.x.ix-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 John iv. 7, 8, 20" id="iv.i.x.ix-p5.2" parsed="|1John|4|7|4|8;|1John|4|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.4.7-1John.4.8 Bible:1John.4.20">1 John iv. 7, 8,

reason that he does not see God is, that he does not love his
brother. For he who does not love his brother, abideth not in love;
and he who abideth not in love, abideth not in God, because God is
love. Further, he who abideth not in God, abideth not in light; for
&#8220;God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.&#8221;<note place="end" n="694" id="iv.i.x.ix-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.x.ix-p6"> <scripRef passage="1 John i. 5" id="iv.i.x.ix-p6.2" parsed="|1John|1|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.1.5">1 John i. 5</scripRef></p></note> He therefore
who abideth not in light, what wonder is it if he does not see
light, that is, does not see God, because he is in darkness? But he
sees his brother with human sight, with which God cannot be seen.
But if he loved with spiritual love him whom he sees with human
sight, he would see God, who is love itself, with the inner sight
by which He can be seen. Therefore he who does not love his brother
whom <pb n="124" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_124.html" id="iv.i.x.ix-Page_124"/>he sees, how can he love God, whom on that account he
does not see, because God is love, which he has not who does not
love his brother? Neither let that further question disturb us, how
much of love we ought to spend upon our brother, and how much upon
God: incomparably more upon God than upon ourselves, but upon our
brother as much as upon ourselves; and we love ourselves so much
the more, the more we love God. Therefore we love God and our
neighbor from one and the same love; but we love God for the sake
of God, and ourselves and our neighbors for the sake of
God.</p>

believe him so to have lived? But we do not believe that the
ministers of God ought so to live because we have heard it from any
one, but because we behold it inwardly within ourselves, or rather
above ourselves, in the truth itself. Him, therefore, whom we
believe to have so lived, we love for that which we see. And except
we loved above all else that form which we discern as always
steadfast and unchangeable, we should not for that reason love him,
because we hold fast in our belief that his life, when he was
living in the flesh, was adapted to, and in harmony with, this
form. But somehow we are stirred up the more to the love of this
form itself, through the belief by which we believe some one to
have so lived; and to the hope by which we no more at all despair,
that we, too, are able so to live; we who are men, from this fact
itself, that some men have so lived, so that we both desire this
more ardently, and pray for it more confidently. So both the love
of that form, according to which they are believed to have lived,
makes the life of these men themselves to be loved by us; and their
life thus believed stirs up a more burning love towards that same
form; so that the more ardently we love God, the more certainly and
the more calmly do we see Him, because we behold in God the
unchangeable form of righteousness, according to which we judge
that man ought to live. Therefore faith avails to the knowledge and
to the love of God, not as though of one altogether unknown, or
altogether not loved; but so that thereby He may be known more
clearly, and loved more steadfastly.</p>

which divine Scripture so greatly praises and proclaims, except the
love of good? But love is <i>of</i> some one that loves, and <i>
with</i> love something <i>is</i> loved. Behold, then, there are
three things: he that loves, and that which is loved, and love.
What, then, is love, except a certain life which couples or seeks
to couple together some two things, namely, him that loves, and
that which is loved? And this is so even in outward and carnal
loves. But that we may drink in something more pure and clear, let
us tread down the flesh and ascend to the mind. What does the mind
love in a friend except the mind? There, then, also are three
things: he that loves, and that which is loved, and love. It
remains to ascend also from hence, and to seek those things which
are above, as far as is given to man. But here for a little while
let our purpose rest, not that it may think itself to have found
already what it seeks; but just as usually the place has first to
be found where anything is to be sought, while the thing itself is
not yet found, but we have only found already where to look for it;

suit with the Son, or at all events which does suit with the
Father, or with the Holy Spirit, or with the Trinity; or if, again,
anything concerning the Holy Spirit, which is not fitly a property
of the Holy Spirit, yet is not alien from the Father, or from the
Son, or from the one God the Trinity itself. Even as now our wish
is to see whether the Holy Spirit is properly that love which is
most excellent which if He is not, either the Father is love, or
the Son, or the Trinity itself; since we cannot withstand the most
certain faith and weighty authority of Scripture, saying, &#8220;God is

<div4 type="Chapter" title="The Three Things Which are Found in Love Must Be Considered." n="2" shorttitle="Chapter 2" progress="23.33%" prev="iv.i.xi.i" next="iv.i.xi.iii" id="iv.i.xi.ii"><p class="c39" id="iv.i.xi.ii-p1">

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xi.ii-p1.1">Chapter 2.&#8212;The Three Things
Which are Found in Love Must Be Considered.<note place="end" n="705" id="iv.i.xi.ii-p1.2"><p id="iv.i.xi.ii-p2"> [Augustin here begins his discussion of some ternaries
that are found in the Finite, that illustrate the trinality of the
Infinite. Like all finite analogies, they fail at certain points.
In the case chosen&#8212;namely, the lover, the loved, and love&#8212;the
first two are substances, the last is not. The mind is a substance,
but its activity in loving is not. In chapter iv. 5, Augustin
asserts that &#8220;love and knowledge exist substantially, as the mind
itself does.&#8221; But no psychology, ancient or modern, has ever
maintained that the agencies of a spiritual entity or substance are
themselves spiritual entity or substances. The activities of the
human mind in cognizing, loving, etc., are only its energizing, not
its substance.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.ii-p3">The ambiguity of the Latin
contributes to this error. The mind and its loving, and also the
mind and its cognizing, are denominated &#8220;<i>duo qu&#230;dam</i>&#8221;
the mind, love, and knowledge, are denominated &#8220;<i>tria
qu&#230;dem</i>.&#8221; By bringing the mind and its love and knowledge
under the one term &#8220;<i>qu&#230;dam</i>,&#8221; and then giving the
meaning of &#8220;substance&#8221; to &#8220;thing,&#8221; in &#8220;something,&#8221; the
result follows that all three are alike and equally
&#8220;substantial.&#8221;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.ii-p4">This analogy taken from the mind
and its activities illustrates the trinality of the Divine essence,
but fails to illustrate the substantiality of the three persons.
The three Divine persons are not the Divine essence together with
two of its activities (such, <i>e.g</i>., as creation and
redemption), but the essence in three modes, or &#8220;forms,&#8221; as St.
Paul denominates them in <scripRef passage="Phil. iii. 6" id="iv.i.xi.ii-p4.2" parsed="|Phil|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.3.6">Phil. iii.
6</scripRef></p>

<p class="MsoEndnoteText" id="iv.i.xi.ii-p5">If Augustin could
prove his assertion that the activities of the human spirit in
knowing and loving are strictly &#8220;substantial,&#8221; then this
ternary would illustrate not only the trinality of the essence, but
the essentiality and objectivity of the persons. The fact which he
mentions, that knowledge and love are <i>inseparable</i> from the
knowing and loving mind, does not prove their equal substantiality
with the mind.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note></span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.ii-p6">2. And this being so, let us direct
our attention to those three things which we fancy we have found.
We are not yet speaking of heavenly things, nor yet of God the
Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit, but of that inadequate image,
which yet is an image, that is, man; for our feeble mind perhaps
can gaze upon this more familiarly and more easily. Well then, when
I, who make this inquiry, love anything, there are three things
concerned&#8212;myself, and that which I love, and love itself. For I
do not love love, except I love a lover; for there is no love where
nothing is loved. Therefore there are three things&#8212;he who loves,
and that which is loved, and love. But what if I love none except
myself? Will there not then be two things&#8212;that which I love, and
love? For he who loves and that which is loved are the same when
any one loves himself; just as to love and to be loved, in the same
way, is the very same thing when any one loves himself. Since the
same thing is said, when it is said, he loves himself, and he is
loved by himself. For in that case to love and to be loved are not
two different things: just as he who loves and he who is loved are
not two different persons. But yet, even so, love and what is loved
are still two things. For there is no love when any one loves
himself, except when love itself is loved. But it is one thing to
love one&#8217;s self, another to love one&#8217;s own love. For love is
not loved, unless as already loving something; since where nothing
is loved there is no love. Therefore there are two things when any
one loves himself&#8212;love, and that which is loved. For then he that
loves and that which is loved are one. Whence it seems that it does
not follow that three things are to be understood wherever love is.
For let us put aside from the inquiry all the other many things of
which a man consists; and in order that we may discover clearly
what we are now seeking, as far as in such a subject is possible,
let us treat of the mind alone. The mind, then, when it loves
itself, discloses two things&#8212;mind and love. But what is to love
one&#8217;s self, except to wish to help one&#8217;s self to the enjoyment
of self? And when any one wishes himself to be just as much as he
is, then the will is on a par with the mind, and the love is equal
to him who loves. And if love is a substance, it is certainly not
body, but spirit; and the mind also is not body, but spirit. Yet
love and mind are not two spirits, but one spirit; nor yet two
essences, but one: and yet here are two things that are one, he
that loves and love; or, if you like so to put it, that which is
loved and love. And these two, indeed, are mutually said
relatively. Since he who loves is referred to love, and love to him
who loves. For he who loves, loves with some love, and love is the
love of some one who loves. But mind and spirit are not said
relatively, but express essence. For mind and spirit do not exist
because the mind and spirit of some particular man exists. For if
we subtract the body from that which is man, which is so called
with the conjunction of body, the mind and spirit remain. But if we
subtract him that loves, then there is no love; and if we subtract
love, then there is no one that loves. And therefore, in so far as
they are mutually referred to one another, they are two; but
whereas they are spoken in re<pb n="127" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_127.html" id="iv.i.xi.ii-Page_127"/>spect to themselves, each are
spirit, and both together also are one spirit; and each are mind,
and both together one mind. Where, then, is the trinity? Let us
attend as much as we can, and let us invoke the everlasting light,
that He may illuminate our darkness, and that we may see in
ourselves, as much as we are permitted, the image of
God.</p>
</div4>

<div4 type="Chapter" title="The Image of the Trinity in the Mind of Man Who Knows Himself and Loves Himself. The Mind Knows Itself Through Itself." n="3" shorttitle="Chapter 3" progress="23.56%" prev="iv.i.xi.ii" next="iv.i.xi.iv" id="iv.i.xi.iii"><p class="c39" id="iv.i.xi.iii-p1">

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xi.iii-p1.1">Chapter 3.&#8212;The Image of the
Trinity in the Mind of Man Who Knows Himself and Loves Himself. The
Mind Knows Itself Through Itself.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.iii-p2">3. For the mind cannot love itself,
except also it know itself; for how can it love what it does not
know? Or if any body says that the mind, from either general or
special knowledge, believes itself of such a character as it has by
experience found others to be and therefore loves itself, he speaks
most foolishly. For whence does a mind know another mind, if it
does not know itself? For the mind does not know other minds and
not know itself, as the eye of the body sees other eyes and does
not see itself; for we see bodies through the eyes of the body,
because, unless we are looking into a mirror, we cannot refract and
reflect the rays into themselves which shine forth through those
eyes, and touch whatever we discern,&#8212;a subject, indeed, which is
treated of most subtlely and obscurely, until it be clearly
demonstrated whether the fact be so, or whether it be not. But
whatever is the nature of the power by which we discern through the
eyes, certainly, whether it be rays or anything else, we cannot
discern with the eyes that power itself; but we inquire into it
with the mind, and if possible, understand even this with the mind.
As the mind, then, itself gathers the knowledge of corporeal things
through the senses of the body, so of incorporeal things through
itself. Therefore it knows itself also through itself, since it is
incorporeal; for if it does not know itself, it does not love
itself.</p>

<div4 type="Chapter" title="The Three are One, and Also Equal, Viz. The Mind Itself, and the Love, and the Knowledge of It. That the Same Three Exist Substantially, and are Predicated Relatively. That the Same Three are Inseparable. That the Same Three are Not Joined and Commingled Like Parts, But that They are of One Essence, and are Relatives." n="4" shorttitle="Chapter 4" progress="23.62%" prev="iv.i.xi.iii" next="iv.i.xi.v" id="iv.i.xi.iv"><p class="c39" id="iv.i.xi.iv-p1">

That the Same Three are Not Joined and Commingled Like Parts, But
that They are of One Essence, and are Relatives.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.iv-p2">4. But as there are two things
(<i>duo qu&#230;dam</i>), the mind and the love of it, when it loves
itself; so there are two things, the mind and the knowledge of it,
when it knows itself. Therefore the mind itself, and the love of
it, and the knowledge of it, are three things (<i>tria
qu&#230;dam</i>), and these three are one; and when they are perfect
they are equal. For if one loves himself less than as he is,&#8212;as
for example, suppose that the mind of a man only loves itself as
much as the body of a man ought to be loved, whereas the mind is
more than the body,&#8212;then it is in fault, and its love is not
perfect. Again, if it loves itself more than as it is,&#8212;as if, for
instance, it loves itself as much as God is to be loved, whereas
the mind is incomparably less than God,&#8212;here also it is
exceedingly in fault, and its love of self is not perfect. But it
is in fault more perversely and wrongly still, when it loves the
body as much as God is to be loved. Also, if knowledge is less than
that thing which is known, and which can be fully known, then
knowledge is not perfect; but if it is greater, then the nature
which knows is above that which is known, as the knowledge of the
body is greater than the body itself, which is known by that
knowledge. For knowledge is a kind of life in the reason of the
knower, but the body is not life; and any life is greater than any
body, not in bulk, but in power. But when the mind knows itself,
its own knowledge does not rise above itself, because itself knows,
and itself is known. When, therefore, it knows itself entirely, and
no other thing with itself, then its knowledge is equal to itself;
because its knowledge is not from another nature, since it knows
itself. And when it perceives itself entirely, and nothing more,
then it is neither less nor greater. We said therefore rightly,
that these three things, [mind, love, and knowledge], when they are
perfect, are by consequence equal.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.iv-p3">5. Similar reasoning suggests to
us, if indeed we can any way understand the matter, that these
things [<i>i.e.</i> love and knowledge] exist in the soul, and
that, being as it were involved in it, they are so evolved from it
as to be perceived and reckoned up substantially, or, so to say,
essentially. Not as though in a subject; as color, or shape, or any
other quality or quantity, are in the body. For anything of this
[material] kind does not go beyond the subject in which it is; for
the color or shape of this particular body cannot be also those of
another body. But the mind can also love something besides itself,
with that love with which it loves itself. And further, the mind
does not know itself only, but also many other things. Wherefore
love and knowledge are not contained in the mind as in a subject,
but these also exist <i>substantially, as the mind itself does</i>;
because, even if they are mutually predicated relatively,
yet <pb n="128" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_128.html" id="iv.i.xi.iv-Page_128"/>they exist each severally in their own substance. Nor
are they so mutually predicated relatively as color and the colored
subject are; so that color is in the colored subject, but has not
any proper substance in itself, since colored body is a substance,
but color is in a substance; but as two friends are also two men,
which are substances, while they are said to be men not relatively,
but friends relatively.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.iv-p4">6. But, further, although one who
loves or one who knows is a substance, and <i>knowledge is a
substance</i>, and <i>love is a substance</i>, but he that loves
and love, or, he that knows and knowledge, are spoken of relatively
to each other, as are friends: yet mind or spirit are not
relatives, as neither are men relatives: nevertheless he that loves
and love, or he that knows and knowledge, cannot exist separately
from each other, as men can that are friends. Although it would
seem that friends, too, can be separated in body, not in mind, in
as far as they are friends: nay, it can even happen that a friend
may even also begin to hate a friend and on this account cease to
be a friend while the other does not know it, and still loves him.
But if the love with which the mind loves itself ceases to be, then
the mind also will at the same time cease to love. Likewise, if the
knowledge by which the mind knows itself ceases to be, then the
mind will also at the same time cease to know itself. Just as the
head of anything that has a head is certainly a head, and they are
predicated relatively to each other, although they are also
substances: for both a head is a body, and so is that which has a
head; and if there be no head, then neither will there be that
which has a head. Only these things can be separated from each
other by cutting off, those cannot.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.iv-p5">7. And even if there are some
bodies which cannot be wholly separated and divided, yet they would
not be bodies unless they consisted of their own proper parts. A
part then is predicated relatively to a whole, since every part is
a part of some whole, and a whole is a whole by having all its
parts. But since both part and whole are bodies, these things are
not only predicated relatively, but exist also substantially.
Perhaps, then, the mind is a whole, and the love with which it
loves itself, and the knowledge with which it knows itself, are as
it were its parts, of which two parts that whole consists. Or are
there three equal parts which make up the one whole? But no part
embraces the whole, of which it is a part; whereas, when the mind
knows itself as a whole, that is, knows itself perfectly, then the
knowledge of it extends through the whole of it; and when it loves
itself perfectly, then it loves itself as a whole, and the love of
it extends through the whole of it. Is it, then, as one drink is
made from wine and water and honey, and each single part extends
through the whole, and yet they are three things (for there is no
part of the drink which does not contain these three things; for
they are not joined as if they were water and oil, but are entirely
commingled: and they are all substances, and the whole of that
liquor which is composed of the three is one substance),&#8212;is it, I
say, in some such way as this we are to think these three to be
together, mind, love, and knowledge? But water, wine, and honey are
not of one substance, although one substance results in the drink
made from the commingling of them. And I cannot see how those other
three are not of the same substance, since the mind itself loves
itself, and itself knows itself; and these three so exist, as that
the mind is neither loved nor known by any other thing at all.
These three, therefore, must needs be of one and the same essence;
and for that reason, if they were confounded together as it were by
a commingling, they could not be in any way three, neither could
they be mutually referred to each other. Just as if you were to
make from one and the same gold three similar rings, although
connected with each other, they are mutually referred to each
other, because they are similar. For everything similar is similar
to something, and there is a trinity of rings, and one gold. But if
they are blended with each other, and each mingled with the other
through the whole of their own bulk, then that trinity will fall
through, and it will not exist at all; and not only will it be
called one gold, as it was called in the case of those three rings,
but now it will not be called three things of gold at
all.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.v-p2">8. But in these three, when the
mind knows itself and loves itself, there remains a trinity: mind,
love, knowledge; and this trinity is not confounded together by any
commingling: although they are each severally in themselves and
mutually all in all, or each severally in each two, or each two in
each. Therefore all are in all. For certainly the mind is in
itself, since it is called mind in respect to itself: although it
is said to be knowing, or known, or knowable, relatively to its own
knowledge; and although also as <pb n="129" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_129.html" id="iv.i.xi.v-Page_129"/>loving, and loved, or lovable,
it is referred to love, by which it loves itself. And knowledge,
although it is referred to the mind that knows or is known,
nevertheless is also predicated both as known and knowing in
respect to itself: for the knowledge by which the mind knows itself
is not unknown to itself. And although love is referred to the mind
that loves, whose love it is; nevertheless it is also love in
respect to itself, so as to exist also in itself: since love too is
loved, yet cannot be loved with anything except with love, that is
with itself. So these things are severally in themselves. But so
are they in each other; because both the mind that loves is <i>
in</i> love, and love is in the knowledge of him that loves, and
knowledge is <i>in</i> the mind that knows. And each severally is
in like manner in each two, because the mind which knows and loves
itself, is in its own love and knowledge: and the love of the mind
that loves and knows itself, is in the mind and in its knowledge:
and the knowledge of the mind that knows and loves itself is in the
mind and in its love, because it loves itself that knows, and knows
itself that loves. And hence also each two is in each severally,
since the mind which knows and loves itself, is together with its
own knowledge in love, and together with its own love in knowledge;
and love too itself and knowledge are together in the mind, which
loves and knows itself. But in what way all are in all, we have
already shown above; since the mind loves itself as a whole, and
knows itself as a whole, and knows its own love wholly, and loves
its own knowledge wholly, when these three things are perfect in
respect to themselves. Therefore these three things are
marvellously inseparable from each other, and yet each of them is
severally a substance, and all together are one substance or
essence, whilst they are mutually predicated relatively.<note place="end" n="706" id="iv.i.xi.v-p2.1"><p id="iv.i.xi.v-p3"> [Augustin here illustrates, by the ternary of mind,

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.vi-p2">9. But when the human mind knows
itself and loves itself, it does not know and love anything
unchangeable: and each individual man declares his own particular
mind by one manner of speech, when he considers what takes place in
himself; but defines the human mind abstractly by special or
general knowledge. And so, when he speaks to me of his own
individual mind, as to whether he understands this or that, or does
not understand it, or whether he wishes or does not wish this or
that, I believe; but when he speaks the truth of the mind of man
generally or specially, I recognize and approve. Whence it is
manifest, that each sees a thing in himself, in such way that
another person may believe what he says of it, yet may not see it;
but another [sees a thing] in the truth itself, in such way that
another person also can gaze upon it; of which the former undergoes
changes at successive times, the latter consists in an unchangeable
eternity. For we do not gather a generic or specific knowledge of
the human mind by means of resemblance by seeing many minds with
the eyes of the body: but we gaze upon indestructible truth, from
which to define perfectly, as far as we can, not of what sort is
the mind of any one particular man, but of what sort it ought to be
upon the eternal plan.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.vi-p3">10. Whence also, even in the case
of the images of things corporeal which are drawn in through the
bodily sense, and in some way infused into the memory, from which
also those things which have not been seen are thought under a
fancied image, whether otherwise than they really are, or even
perchance as they are;&#8212;even here too, we are proved either to
accept or reject, within ourselves, by other rules which remain
altogether unchangeable above our mind, when we approve or reject
anything rightly. For both when I recall the walls of Carthage
which I have seen, and imagine to myself the walls of Alexandria
which I have not seen, and, in preferring this to that among forms
which in both cases are imaginary, make that preference upon
grounds of reason; the judgment of truth from above is still strong
and clear, and rests firmly upon the utterly indestructible rules
of its own right; and if it is covered as it were by cloudiness of
corporeal images, yet is not wrapt up and confounded in
them.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.vi-p4">11. But it makes a difference,
whether, <pb n="130" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_130.html" id="iv.i.xi.vi-Page_130"/>under that or in that darkness, I am shut off as it were
from the clear heaven; or whether (as usually happens on lofty
mountains), enjoying the free air between both, I at once look up
above to the calmest light, and down below upon the densest clouds.
For whence is the ardor of brotherly love kindled in me, when I
hear that some man has borne bitter torments for the excellence and
steadfastness of faith? And if that man is shown to me with the
finger, I am eager to join myself to him, to become acquainted with
him, to bind him to myself in friendship. And accordingly, if
opportunity offers, I draw near, I address him, I converse with
him, I express my goodwill towards him in what words I can, and
wish that in him too in turn should be brought to pass and
expressed goodwill towards me; and I endeavor after a spiritual
embrace in the way of belief, since I cannot search out so quickly
and discern altogether his innermost heart. I love therefore the
faithful and courageous man with a pure and genuine love. But if he
were to confess to me in the course of conversation, or were
through unguardedness to show in any way, that either he believes
something unseemly of God, and desires also something carnal in
Him, and that he bore these torments on behalf of such an error, or
from the desire of money for which he hoped, or from empty
greediness of human praise: immediately it follows that the love
with which I was borne towards him, displeased, and as it were
repelled, and taken away from an unworthy man, remains in that
form, after which, believing him such as I did, I had loved him;
unless perhaps I have come to love him to this end, that he may
become such, while I have found him not to be such in fact. And in
that man, too, nothing is changed: although it can be changed, so
that he may become that which I had believed him to be already. But
in my mind there certainly is something changed, <i>viz</i>., the
estimate I had formed of him, which was before of one sort, and now
is of another: and the same love, at the bidding from above of
unchangeable righteousness, is turned aside from the purpose of
enjoying, to the purpose of taking counsel. But the form itself of
unshaken and stable truth, wherein I should have enjoyed the
fruition of the man, believing him to be good, and wherein likewise
I take counsel that he may be good, sheds in an immoveable eternity
the same light of incorruptible and most sound reason, both upon
the sight of my mind, and upon that cloud of images, which I
discern from above, when I think of the same man whom I had seen.
Again, when I call back to my mind some arch, turned beautifully
and symmetrically, which, let us say, I saw at Carthage; a certain
reality that had been made known to the mind through the eyes, and
transferred to the memory, causes the imaginary view. But I behold
in my mind yet another thing, according to which that work of art
pleases me; and whence also, if it displeased me, I should correct
it. We judge therefore of those particular things according to that
[form of eternal truth], and discern that form by the intuition of
the rational mind. But those things themselves we either touch if
present by the bodily sense, or if absent remember their images as
fixed in our memory, or picture, in the way of likeness to them,
such things as we ourselves also, if we wished and were able, would
laboriously build up: figuring in the mind after one fashion the
images of bodies, or seeing bodies through the body; but after
another, grasping by simple intelligence what is above the eye of
the mind, <i>viz</i>., the reasons and the unspeakably beautiful
skill of such forms.</p>

desire or by love: not that the creature ought not to be loved; but
if that love [of the creature] is referred to the Creator, then it
will not be desire (<i>cupiditas</i>), but love (<i>charitas</i>).
For it is desire when the creature is loved for itself. And then it
does not help a man through making use of it, but corrupts him in
the enjoying it. When, therefore, the creature is either equal to
us or inferior, we must use the inferior in order to God, but we
must enjoy the equal duly in God. For as thou oughtest to enjoy
thyself, not in thyself, but in Him who made thee, so also him whom
thou lovest as thyself. Let us enjoy, therefore, both ourselves and
our brethren in the Lord; and hence let us not dare to yield, and
as it were to relax, ourselves to ourselves in the direction
downwards. Now a word is born, when, being thought out, it pleases
us either to the effect of sinning, or to that of doing right.
Therefore love, as it were a mean, conjoins our word and the mind
from which it is conceived, and without any confusion binds itself
as a third with them, in an incorporeal embrace.</p>

itself, as is the case in the love of spiritual things. For
instance, he who knows righteousness perfectly, and loves it
perfectly, is already righteous; even if no necessity exist of
working according to it outwardly through the members of the body.
But in the love of carnal and temporal things, as in the offspring
of animals, the conception of the word is one thing, the bringing
forth another. For here what is conceived by desiring is born by
attaining. Since it does not suffice to avarice to know and to love
gold, except it also have it; nor to know and love to eat, or to
lie with any one, unless also one does it; nor to know and love
honors and power, unless they actually come to pass. Nay, all these

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.x-p2">15. It is rightly asked then,
whether all knowledge is a word, or only knowledge that is loved.
For we also know the things which we hate; but what we do not like,
cannot be said to be either conceived or brought forth by the mind.
For not all things which in anyway touch it, are conceived by it;
but some only reach the point of being known, but yet are not
spoken as words, as for instance those of which we speak now. For
those are called words in one way, which occupy spaces of time by
their syllables, whether they are pronounced or only thought; and
in another way, all that is known is called a word imprinted on the
mind, as long as it can be brought forth from the memory and
defined, even though we dislike the thing itself; and in another
way still, when we like that which is conceived in the mind. And
that which the apostle says, must be taken according to this last
kind of word, &#8220;No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the
Holy Ghost;&#8221;<note place="end" n="717" id="iv.i.xi.x-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xi.x-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xii. 3" id="iv.i.xi.x-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|12|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.3">1 Cor. xii. 3</scripRef></p></note> since those
also say this, but according to another meaning of the term

the case of things which we hate, when we rightly dislike and
rightly censure them, we approve and like the censure bestowed upon
them, and it becomes a word. Nor is it the knowledge of vices that
displeases us, but the <pb n="132" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_132.html" id="iv.i.xi.x-Page_132"/>vices themselves. For I like to
know and define what intemperance is; and this is its word. Just as
there are known faults in art, and the knowledge of them is rightly
approved, when a connoisseur discerns the species or the privation
of excellence, as to affirm and deny that it is or that it is not;
yet to be without excellence and to fall away into fault, is worthy
of condemnation. And to define intemperance, and to say its word,
belongs to the art of morals; but to be intemperate belongs to that
which that art censures. Just as to know and define what a solecism
is, belongs to the art of speaking; but to be guilty of one, is a
fault which the same art reprehends. A word, then, which is the
point we wish now to discern and intimate, is knowledge together
with love. Whenever, then, the mind knows and loves itself, its
word is joined to it by love. And since it loves knowledge and
knows love, both the word is in love and love is in the word, and
both are in him who loves and speaks.<note place="end" n="719" id="iv.i.xi.x-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xi.x-p5"> [The meaning of this obscure
chapter seems to be, that only what the mind is pleased with, is
the real expression and index of the mind&#8212;its true &#8220;word.&#8221;
The true nature of the mind is revealed in its sympathies. But this
requires some qualification. For in the case of contrary qualities,
like right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, the real nature of the
mind is seen also in its antipathy as well as in its sympathy; in
its hatred of wrong as well as in its love of right. Each alike is
a true index of the mind, because each really implies the
other.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.xi-p2">16. But all knowledge according to
species is like the thing which it knows. For there is another
knowledge according to privation, according to which we speak a
word only when we condemn. And this condemnation of a privation is
equivalent to praise of the species, and so is approved. The mind,
then, contains some likeness to a known species, whether when
liking that species or when disliking its privation. And hence, in
so far as we know God, we are like Him, but not like to the point
of equality, since we do not know Him to the extent of His own
being. And as, when we speak of bodies by means of the bodily
sense, there arises in our mind some likeness of them, which is a
phantasm of the memory; for the bodies themselves are not at all in
the mind, when we think them, but only the likenesses of those
bodies; therefore, when we approve the latter for the former, we
err, for the approving of one thing for another is an error; yet
the image of the body in the mind is a thing of a better sort than
the species of the body itself, inasmuch as the former is in a
better nature, <i>viz</i>. in a living substance, as the mind is:
so when we know God, although we are made better than we were
before we knew Him, and above all when the same knowledge being
also liked and worthily loved becomes a word, and so that knowledge
becomes a kind of likeness of God; yet that knowledge is of a lower
kind, since it is in a lower nature; for the mind is creature, but
God is Creator. And from this it may be inferred, that when the
mind knows and approves itself, this same knowledge is in such way
its word, as that it is altogether on a par and equal with it, and
the same; because it is neither the knowledge of a lower essence,
as of the body, nor of a higher, as of God. And whereas knowledge
bears a likeness to that which it knows, that is, of which it is
the knowledge; in this case it has perfect and equal likeness, when
the mind itself, which knows, is known. And so it is both image and
word; because it is uttered concerning that mind to which it is
equalled in knowing, and that which is begotten is equal to the

the Offspring of the Mind, as Knowledge is So. The Solution of the
Question. The Mind with the Knowledge of Itself and the Love of
Itself is the Image of the Trinity.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.xii-p2">17. What then is love? Will it not
be an image? Will it not be a word? Will it not be begotten? For
why does the mind beget its knowledge when it knows itself, and not
beget its love when it loves itself? For if it is the cause of its
own knowing, for the reason that it is knowable, it is also the
cause of its own love because it is lovable. It is hard, then, to
say why it does not beget both. For there is a further question
also respecting the supreme Trinity itself, the omnipotent God the
Creator, after whose image man is made, which troubles men, whom
the truth of God invites to the faith by human speech; <i>viz</i>.
why the Holy Spirit is not also to be either believed or understood
to be begotten by God the Father, so that He also may be called a
Son. And this question we are endeavoring in some way to
investigate in the human mind, in order that from a lower image, in
which our own nature itself as it were answers, upon being
questioned, in a way more familiar to ourselves, we may be able to
direct a more practised mental vision from the enlightened creature
to the unchangeable light; assuming, however, that the truth itself
has persuaded us, that as no Christian doubts the Word of God to be
the Son, so that the Holy Spirit is love. Let us return, then, to a
more careful questioning and consideration upon this subject of
that image which is the creature, that is, of the rational mind;
wherein the knowl<pb n="133" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_133.html" id="iv.i.xi.xii-Page_133"/>edge of some things coming into
existence in time, but which did not exist before, and the love of
some things which were not loved before, opens to us more clearly
what to say: because to speech also itself, which must be disposed
in time, that thing is easier of explanation which is comprehended
in the order of time.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.xii-p3">18. First, therefore, it is clear
that a thing may possibly be knowable, that is, such as can be
known, and yet that it may be unknown; but that it is not possible
for that to be known which is not knowable. Wherefore it must be
clearly held that everything whatsoever that we know begets at the
same time in us the knowledge of itself; for knowledge is brought
forth from both, from the knower and from the thing known. When,
therefore, the mind knows itself, it alone is the parent of its own
knowledge; for it is itself both the thing known and the knower of
it. But it was knowable to itself also before it knew itself, only
the knowledge of itself was not in itself so long as it did not
know itself. In knowing itself, then, it begets a knowledge of
itself equal to itself; since it does not know itself as less than
itself is, nor is its knowledge the knowledge of the essence of
some one else, not only because itself knows, but also because it
knows itself, as we have said above. What then is to be said of
love; why, when the mind loves itself, it should not seem also to
have begotten the love of itself? For it was lovable to itself even
before it loved itself since it could love itself; just as it was
knowable to itself even before it knew itself, since it could know
itself. For if it were not knowable to itself, it never could have
known itself; and so, if it were not lovable to itself, it never
could have loved itself. Why therefore may it not be said by loving
itself to have begotten its own love, as by knowing itself it has
begotten its own knowledge? Is it because it is thereby indeed
plainly shown that this is the principle of love, whence it
proceeds? for it proceeds from the mind itself, which is lovable to
itself before it loves itself, and so is the principle of its own
love by which it loves itself: but that this love is not therefore
rightly said to be begotten by the mind, as is the knowledge of
itself by which the mind knows itself, because in the case of
knowledge the thing has been found already, which is what we call
brought forth or discovered;<note place="end" n="720" id="iv.i.xi.xii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xi.xii-p4"> &#8220;<i>Partum</i>&#8221; or
&#8220;<i>repertum</i>.&#8221;</p></note> and this is commonly preceded by an
inquiry such as to find rest when that end is attained. For inquiry
is the desire of finding, or, what is the same thing, of
discovering.<note place="end" n="721" id="iv.i.xi.xii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xi.xii-p5"> 
&#8220;<i>Reperiendi</i>.&#8221;</p></note> But those
things which are discovered are as it were brought forth, whence
they are like offspring; but wherein, except in the case itself of
knowledge? For in that case they are as it were uttered and
fashioned. For although the things existed already which we found
by seeking, yet the knowledge of them did not exist, which
knowledge we regard as an offspring that is born. Further, the
desire (<i>appetitus</i>) which there is in seeking proceeds from
him who seeks, and is in some way in suspense, and does not rest in
the end whither it is directed, except that which is sought be
found and conjoined with him who seeks. And this desire, that is,
inquiry,&#8212;although it does not seem to be love, by which that
which is known is loved, for in this case we are still striving to
know,&#8212;yet it is something of the same kind. For it can be called
will (<i>voluntas</i>), since every one who seeks wills
(<i>vult</i>) to find; and if that is sought which belongs to
knowledge, every one who seeks wills to know. But if he wills
ardently and earnestly, he is said to study (<i>studere</i>): a
word that is most commonly employed in the case of pursuing and
obtaining any branches of learning. Therefore, the bringing forth
of the mind is preceded by some desire, by which, through seeking
and finding what we wish to know, the offspring, <i>viz</i>.
knowledge itself, is born. And for this reason, that desire by
which knowledge is conceived and brought forth, cannot rightly be
called the bringing forth and the offspring; and the same desire
which led us to long for the knowing of the thing, becomes the love
of the thing when known, while it holds and embraces its accepted
offspring, that is, knowledge, and unites it to its begetter. And
so there is a kind of image of the Trinity in the mind itself, and
the knowledge of it, which is its offspring and its word concerning
itself, and love as a third, and these three are one, and one
substance.<note place="end" n="722" id="iv.i.xi.xii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xi.xii-p6"> [It is not these three together
that <i>constitute</i> the one substance. The mind alone is the
substance&#8212;the knowledge and the love being only two activities of
it. When the mind is not cognizing or loving, it is still an entire
mind. As previously remarked in the annotation on IX. ii. this
ternary will completely illustrate a trinality of a certain kind,
but not that of the Trinity; in which the &#8220;<i>tria qu&#230;dam</i>&#8221;
are three subsistences, each of which is so substantial as to be
the subject of attributes, and to be able to employ them. The human
mind is substantial enough to possess and employ the attributes of
knowledge and love. We say that the mind knows and loves. But an
<i>activity</i> of the mind is not substantial enough to possess
and employ the attributes of knowledge and love. We cannot say that
the loving loves; or the loving knows; or the knowing loves,
etc.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> Neither is
the offspring less, since the mind knows itself according to the
measure of its own being; nor is the love less, since it loves
itself according to the measure both of its own knowledge and of
its own being.</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xii.i-p1.1">Chapter 1.&#8212;The Love of the
Studious Mind, that Is, of One Desirous to Know, is Not the Love of
a Thing Which It Does Not Know.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.i-p2">1. <span class="c19" id="iv.i.xii.i-p2.1">
Let</span> us now proceed, then, in due order,
with a more exact purpose, to explain this same point more
thoroughly. And first, since no one can love at all a thing of
which he is wholly ignorant, we must carefully consider of what
sort is the love of those who are studious, that is, of those who
do not already know, but are still desiring to know any branch of
learning. Now certainly, in those things whereof the word study is
not commonly used, love often arises from hearsay, when the
reputation of anything for beauty inflames the mind to the seeing
and enjoying it; since the mind knows generically wherein consist
the beauties of corporeal things, from having seen them very
frequently, and since there exists within a faculty of approving
that which outwardly is longed for. And when this happens, the love
that is called forth is not of a thing wholly unknown, since its
genus is thus known. But when we love a good man whose face we
never saw, we love him from the knowledge of his virtues, which
virtues we know [abstractly] in the truth itself. But in the case
of learning, it is for the most part the authority of others who
praise and commend it that kindles our love of it; although
nevertheless we could not burn with any zeal at all for the study
of it, unless we had already in our mind at least a slight
impression of the knowledge of each kind of learning. For who, for
instance, would devote any care and labor to the learning of
rhetoric, unless he knew before that it was the science of
speaking? Sometimes, again, we marvel at the results of learning
itself, which we have heard of or experienced; and hence burn to
obtain, by learning, the power of attaining these results. Just as
if it were said to one who did not know his letters, that there is
a kind of learning which enables a man to send words, wrought with
the hand in silence, to one who is ever so far absent, for him in
turn to whom they are sent to gather these words, not with his
ears, but with his eyes; and if the man were to see the thing
actually done, is not that man, since he desires to know how he can
do this thing, altogether moved to study with a view to the result
which he already knows and holds? So it is that the studious zeal
of those who learn is kindled: for that of which any one is utterly
ignorant, he can in no way love.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.i-p3">2. So also, if any one hear an
unknown sign, as, for instance, the sound of some word of which he
does not know the signification, he desires to know what it is;
that is, he desires to know what thing it is which it is agreed
shall be brought to mind by that sound: as if he heard the word <i>
temetum</i><note place="end" n="723" id="iv.i.xii.i-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xii.i-p4"> Wine.</p></note> uttered, and
not knowing, should ask what it is. He must then know already that
it is a sign, <i>i.e.</i> that the word is not an empty sound, but
that something is signified by it; for in other respects this
trisyllabic word is known to him already, and has already impressed
its articulate form upon his mind through the sense of hearing. And
then what more is to be required in him, that he may go on to a
greater knowledge of that of which all the letters and all the
spaces of its several sounds are already known, unless that it
shall at the same time have become known to him that it is a sign,
and shall have also moved him with the desire of knowing of what it
is the sign? The more, then, the thing is known, yet not fully
known, the more the mind desires to know concerning it what remains
to be known. For if he <pb n="135" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_135.html" id="iv.i.xii.i-Page_135"/>knew it to be only such and
such a spoken word, and did not know that it was the sign of
something, he would seek nothing further, since the sensible thing
is already perceived as far as it can be by the sense. But because
he knows it to be not only a spoken word, but also a sign, he
wishes to know it perfectly; and no sign is known perfectly, except
it be known of what it is the sign. He then who with ardent
carefulness seeks to know this, and inflamed by studious zeal
perseveres in the search; can such an one be said to be without
love? What then does he love? For certainly nothing can be loved
unless it is known. For that man does not love those three
syllables which he knows already. But if he loves this in them,
that he knows them to signify something, this is not the point now
in question, for it is not this which he seeks to know. But we are
now asking what it is he loves, in that which he is desirous to
know, but which certainly he does not yet know; and we are
therefore wondering why he loves, since we know most assuredly that
nothing can be loved unless it be known. What then does he love,
except that he knows and perceives in the reason of things what
excellence there is in learning, in which the knowledge of all
signs is contained; and what benefit there is in the being skilled
in these, since by them human fellowship mutually communicates its
own perceptions, lest the assemblies of men should be actually
worse than utter solitude, if they were not to mingle their
thoughts by conversing together? The soul, then, discerns this
fitting and serviceable species, and knows it, and loves it; and he
who seeks the meaning of any words of which he is ignorant, studies
to render that species perfect in himself as much as he can: for it
is one thing to behold it in the light of truth, another to desire
it as within his own capacity. For he beholds in the light of truth
how great and how good a thing it is to understand and to speak all
tongues of all nations, and so to hear no tongue and to be heard by
none as from a foreigner. The beauty, then, of this knowledge is
already discerned by thought, and the thing being known is loved;
and that thing is so regarded, and so stimulates the studious zeal
of learners, that they are moved with respect to it, and desire it
eagerly in all the labor which they spend upon the attainment of
such a capacity, in order that they may also embrace in practice
that which they know beforehand by reason. And so every one, the
nearer he approaches that capacity in hope, the more fervently
desires it with love; for those branches of learning are studied
the more eagerly, which men do not despair of being able to attain;
for when any one entertains no hope of attaining his end, then he
either loves lukewarmly or does not love at all, howsoever he may
see the excellence of it. Accordingly, because the knowledge of all
languages is almost universally felt to be hopeless, every one
studies most to know that of his own nation; but if he feels that
he is not sufficient even to comprehend this perfectly, yet no one
is so indolent in this knowledge as not to wish to know, when he
hears an unknown word, what it is, and to seek and learn it if he
can. And while he is seeking it, certainly he has a studious zeal
of learning, and seems to love a thing he does not know; but the
case is really otherwise. For that species touches the mind, which
the mind knows and thinks, wherein the fitness is clearly visible
which accrues from the associating of minds with one another, in
the hearing and returning of known and spoken words. And this
species kindles studious zeal in him who seeks what indeed he knows
not, but gazes upon and loves the unknown form to which that
pertains. If then, for example, any one were to ask, What is <i>
temetum</i> (for I had instanced this word already), and it were
said to him, What does this matter to you? he will answer, Lest
perhaps I hear some one speaking, and understand him not; or
perhaps read the word somewhere, and know not what the writer
meant. Who, pray, would say to such an inquirer, Do not care about
understanding what you hear; do not care about knowing what you
read? For almost every rational soul quickly discerns the beauty of
that knowledge, through which the thoughts of men are mutually made
known by the enunciation of significant words; and it is on account
of this fitness thus known, and because known therefore loved, that
such an unknown word is studiously sought out. When then he hears
and learns that wine was called &#8220;<i>temetum</i>&#8221; by our
forefathers, but that the word is already quite obsolete in our
present usage of language, he will think perhaps that he has still
need of the word on account of this or that book of those
forefathers. But if he holds these also to be superfluous, perhaps
he does now come to think the word not worth remembering, since he
sees it has nothing to do with that species of learning which he
knows with the mind, and gazes upon, and so loves.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.i-p5">3. Wherefore in all cases the love
of a studious mind, that is, of one that wishes to know what it
does not know, is not the love of that thing which it does not
know, but of that which it knows; on account of which it
<pb n="136" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_136.html" id="iv.i.xii.i-Page_136"/>wishes
to know what it does not know. Or if it is so inquisitive as to be
carried away, not for any other cause known to it, but by the mere
love of knowing things unknown; then such an inquisitive person is,
doubtless distinguishable from an ordinary student, yet does not,
any more than he, love things he does not know; nay, on the
contrary, he is more fitly said to hate things he knows not, of
which he wishes that there should be none, in wishing to know
everything. But lest any one should lay before us a more difficult
question, by declaring that it is just as impossible for any one to
hate what he does not know, as to love what he does not know, we
will not withstand what is true; but it must be understood that it
is not the same thing to say he loves to know things unknown, as to
say he loves things unknown. For it is possible that a man may love
to know things unknown; but it is not possible that he should love
things unknown. For the word to know is not placed there without
meaning; since he who loves to know things unknown, does not love
the unknown things themselves, but the knowing of them. And unless
he knew what knowing means, no one could say confidently, either
that he knew or that he did not know. For not only he who says I
know, and says so truly, must needs know what knowing is; but he
also who says, I do not know, and says so confidently and truly,
and knows that he says so truly, certainly knows what knowing is;
for he both distinguishes him who does not know from him who knows,
when he looks into himself and says truly I do not know; and
whereas he knows that he says this truly, whence should he know it,
if he did not know what knowing is?</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xii.ii-p1.1">Chapter 2.&#8212;No One at All Loves Things
Unknown.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.ii-p2">4. No studious person, then, no
inquisitive person, loves things he does not know, even while he is
urgent with the most vehement desire to know what he does not know.
For he either knows already generically what he loves, and longs to
know it also in some individual or individuals, which perhaps are
praised, but not yet known to him; and he pictures in his mind an
imaginary form by which he may be stirred to love. And whence does
he picture this, except from those things which he has already
known? And yet perhaps he will not love it, if he find that form
which was praised to be unlike that other form which was figured
and in thought most fully known to his mind. And if he has loved
it, he will begin to love it from that time when he learned it;
since a little before, that form which was loved was other than
that which the mind that formed it had been wont to exhibit to
itself. But if he shall find it similar to that form which report
had proclaimed, and to be such that he could truly say I was
already loving thee; yet certainly not even then did he love a form
he did not know, since he had known it in that likeness. Or else we
see somewhat in the species of the eternal reason, and therein love
it; and when this is manifested in some image of a temporal thing,
and we believe the praises of those who have made trial of it, and
so love it, then we do not love anything unknown, according to that
which we have already sufficiently discussed above. Or else, again,
we love something known, and on account of it seek something
unknown; and so it is by no means the love of the thing unknown
that possesses us, but the love of the thing known, to which we
know the unknown thing belongs, so that we know that too which we
seek still as unknown; as a little before I said of an unknown
word. Or else, again, every one loves the very knowing itself, as
no one can fail to know who desires to know anything. For these
reasons they seem to love things unknown who wish to know anything
which they do not know, and who, on account of their vehement
desire of inquiry, cannot be said to be without love. But how
different the case really is, and that nothing at all can be loved
which is not known, I think I must have persuaded every one who
carefully looks upon truth. But since the examples which we have
given belong to those who desire to know something which they
themselves are not, we must take thought lest perchance some new
notion appear, when the mind desires to know itself.</p>

<div4 type="Chapter" title="That When the Mind Loves Itself, It is Not Unknown to Itself." n="3" shorttitle="Chapter 3" progress="25.55%" prev="iv.i.xii.ii" next="iv.i.xii.iv" id="iv.i.xii.iii"><p class="c39" id="iv.i.xii.iii-p1">

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xii.iii-p1.1">Chapter 3.&#8212;That
When the Mind Loves Itself, It is Not Unknown to Itself.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.iii-p2">5. What, then, does the mind love,
when it seeks ardently to know itself, whilst it is still unknown
to itself? For, behold, the mind seeks to know itself, and is
excited thereto by studious zeal. It loves, therefore; but what
does it love? Is it itself? But how can this be when it does not
yet know itself, and no one can love what he does not know? Is it
that report has declared to it its own species, in like way as we
commonly hear of people who are absent? Perhaps, then, it does not
love itself, but loves that which it imagines of itself, which is
perhaps widely different from what itself is: or if the phantasy in
the mind is like the mind itself, and 
<pb n="137" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_137.html" id="iv.i.xii.iii-Page_137"/>so when it loves this
fancied image, it loves itself before it knew itself, because it
gazes upon that which is like itself; then it knew other minds from
which to picture itself, and so is known to itself generically.
Why, then, when it knows other minds, does it not know itself,
since nothing can possibly be more present to it than itself? But
if, as other eyes are more known to the eyes of the body, than
those eyes are to themselves; then let it not seek itself, because
it never will find itself. For eyes can never see themselves except
in looking-glasses; and it cannot be supposed in any way that
anything of that kind can be applied also to the contemplation of
incorporeal things, so that the mind should know itself, as it
were, in a looking-glass. Or does it see in the reason of eternal
truth how beautiful it is to know one&#8217;s self, and so loves this
which it sees, and studies to bring it to pass in itself? because,
although it is not known to itself, yet it is known to it how good
it is, that it should be known to itself. And this, indeed, is very
wonderful, that it does not yet know itself, and yet knows already
how excellent a thing it is to know itself. Or does it see some
most excellent end, <i>viz</i>. its own serenity and blessedness,
by some hidden remembrance, which has not abandoned it, although it
has gone far onwards, and believes that it cannot attain to that
same end unless it know itself? And so while it loves that, it
seeks this; and loves that which is known, on account of which it
seeks that which is unknown. But why should the remembrance of its
own blessedness be able to last, and the remembrance of itself not
be able to last as well; that so it should know itself which wishes
to attain, as well as know that to which it wishes to attain? Or
when it loves to know itself, does it love, not itself, which it
does not yet know, but the very act of knowing; and feel the more
annoyed that itself is wanting to its own knowledge wherewith it
wishes to embrace all things? And it knows what it is to know; and
whilst it loves this, which it knows, desires also to know itself.
Whereby, then, does it know its own knowing, if it does not know
itself? For it knows that it knows other things, but that it does
not know itself; for it is from hence that it knows also what
knowing is. In what way, then, does that which does not know
itself, know itself as knowing anything? For it does not know that
some other mind knows, but that itself does so. Therefore it knows
itself. Further, when it seeks to know itself, it knows itself now
as seeking. Therefore again it knows itself. And hence it cannot
altogether not know itself, when certainly it does so far know
itself as that it knows itself as not knowing itself. But if it
does not know itself not to know itself, then it does not seek to
know itself. And therefore, in the very fact that it seeks itself,
it is clearly convicted of being more known to itself than unknown.
For it knows itself as seeking and as not knowing itself, in that
it seeks to know itself.</p>

<div4 type="Chapter" title="How the Mind Knows Itself, Not in Part, But as a Whole." n="4" shorttitle="Chapter 4" progress="25.70%" prev="iv.i.xii.iii" next="iv.i.xii.v" id="iv.i.xii.iv"><p class="c39" id="iv.i.xii.iv-p1">

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xii.iv-p1.1">Chapter 4.&#8212;How the Mind
Knows Itself, Not in Part, But as a Whole.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.iv-p2">6. What then shall we say? Does
that which knows itself in part, not know itself in part? But it is
absurd to say, that it does not as a whole know what it knows. I do
not say, it knows wholly; but what it knows, it as a whole knows.
When therefore it knows anything about itself, which it can only
know as a whole, it knows itself as a whole. But it does know that
itself knows something, while yet except as a whole it cannot know
anything. Therefore it knows itself as a whole. Further, what in it
is so known to itself, as that it lives? And it cannot at once be a
mind, and not live, while it has also something over and above, <i>
viz</i>., that it understands: for the souls of beasts also live,
but do not understand. As therefore a mind is a whole mind, so it
lives as a whole. But it knows that it lives. Therefore it knows
itself as a whole. Lastly, when the mind seeks to know itself, it
already knows that it is a mind: otherwise it knows not whether it
seeks itself, and perhaps seeks one thing while intending to seek
another. For it might happen that itself was not a mind, and so, in
seeking to know a mind, that it did not seek to know itself.
Wherefore since the mind, when it seeks to know what mind is, knows
that it seeks itself, certainly it knows that itself is a mind.
Furthermore, if it knows this in itself, that it is a mind, and a
whole mind, then it knows itself as a whole. But suppose it did not
know itself to be a mind, but in seeking itself only knew that it
did seek itself. For so, too, it may possibly seek one thing for
another, if it does not know this: but that it may not seek one
thing for another, without doubt it knows what it seeks. But if it
knows what it seeks, and seeks itself, then certainly it knows
itself. What therefore more does it seek? But if it knows itself in
part, but still seeks itself in part, then it seeks not itself, but
part of itself. For when we speak of the mind itself, we speak of
it as a whole. Further, because it knows that it is not yet found
by itself as a whole, it knows how much the whole is. And so it
seeks that <pb n="138" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_138.html" id="iv.i.xii.iv-Page_138"/>which is wanting, as we are wont to seek to recall to
the mind something that has slipped from the mind, but has not
altogether gone away from it; since we can recognize it, when it
has come back, to be the same thing that we were seeking. But how
can mind come into mind, as though it were possible for the mind
not to be in the mind? Add to this, that if, having found a part,
it does not seek itself as a whole, yet it as a whole seeks itself.
Therefore as a whole it is present to itself, and there is nothing
left to be sought: for that is wanting which is sought, not the
mind which seeks. Since therefore it as a whole seeks itself,
nothing of it is wanting. Or if it does not as a whole seek itself,
but the part which has been found seeks the part which has not yet
been found then the mind does not seek itself, of which no part
seeks itself. For the part which has been found, does not seek
itself; nor yet does the part itself which has not yet been found,
seek itself; since it is sought by that part which has been already
found. Wherefore, since neither the mind as a whole seeks itself,
nor does any part of it seek itself, the mind does not seek itself
at all.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.v-p2">7. Why therefore is it enjoined
upon it, that it should know itself? I suppose, in order that, it
may consider itself, and live according to its own nature; that is,
seek to be regulated according to its own nature, <i>viz</i>.,
under Him to whom it ought to be subject, and above those things to
which it is to be preferred; under Him by whom it ought to be
ruled, above those things which it ought to rule. For it does many
things through vicious desire, as though in forgetfulness of
itself. For it sees some things intrinsically excellent, in that
more excellent nature which is God: and whereas it ought to remain
steadfast that it may enjoy them, it is turned away from Him, by
wishing to appropriate those things to itself, and not to be like
to Him by His gift, but to be what He is by its own, and it begins
to move and slip gradually down into less and less, which it thinks
to be more and more; for it is neither sufficient for itself, nor
is anything at all sufficient for it, if it withdraw from Him who
is alone sufficient: and so through want and distress it becomes
too intent upon its own actions and upon the unquiet delights which
it obtains through them: and thus, by the desire of acquiring
knowledge from those things that are without, the nature of which
it knows and loves, and which it feels can be lost unless held fast
with anxious care, it loses its security, and thinks of itself so
much the less, in proportion as it feels the more secure that it
cannot lose itself. So, whereas it is one thing not to know
oneself, and another not to think of oneself (for we do not say of
the man that is skilled in much learning, that he is ignorant of
grammar, when he is only not thinking of it, because he is thinking
at the time of the art of medicine);&#8212;whereas, then, I say it is
one thing not to know oneself, and another not to think of oneself,
such is the strength of love, that the mind draws in with itself
those things which it has long thought of with love, and has grown
into them by the close adherence of diligent study, even when it
returns in some way to think of itself. And because these things
are corporeal which it loved externally through the carnal senses;
and because it has become entangled with them by a kind of daily
familiarity, and yet cannot carry those corporeal things themselves
with itself internally as it were into the region of incorporeal
nature; therefore it combines certain images of them, and thrusts
them thus made from itself into itself. For it gives to the forming
of them somewhat of its own substance, yet preserves the while
something by which it may judge freely of the species of those
images; and this something is more properly the mind, that is, the
rational understanding, which is preserved that it may judge. For
we see that we have those parts of the soul which are informed by
the likenesses of corporeal things, in common also with
beasts.</p>

lovingly and intimately connects itself with these images, as even
to consider itself to be something of the same kind. For so it is
conformed to them to some extent, not by being this, but by
thinking it is so: not that it thinks itself to be an image, but
outright that very thing itself of which it entertains the image.
For there still lives in it the power of distinguishing the
corporeal thing which it leaves without, from the image of that
corporeal thing which it contains therefrom within itself: except
when these images are so projected as if felt without and not
thought within, as in the case of people who are asleep, or mad, or
in a trance.</p>

itself to be something of this kind, it thinks itself to be a
corporeal thing; and since it is perfectly conscious of its own
superiority, by which it rules the body, it has hence come to pass
that the question has been raised what part of the body has the
greater power in the body; and the opinion has been held that this
is the mind, nay, that it is even the whole soul altogether. And
some accordingly think it to be the blood, others the brain, others
the heart; not as the Scripture says, &#8220;I will praise Thee, O
Lord, with my whole heart;&#8221; and, &#8220;Thou shall love the Lord thy

metaphor is transferred from the body to the soul; but they have
simply thought it to be that small part itself of the body, which
we see when the inward parts are rent asunder. Others, again, have
believed the soul to be made up of very minute and individual
corpustules, which they call atoms, meeting in themselves and
cohering. Others have said that its substance is air, others fire.
Others have been of opinion that it is no substance at all, since
they could not think any substance unless it is body, and they did
not find that the soul was body; but it was in their opinion the
tempering together itself of our body, or the combining together of
the elements, by which that flesh is as it were conjoined. And
hence all of these have held the soul to be mortal; since, whether
it were body, or some combination of body, certainly it could not
in either case continue always without death. But they who have
held its substance to be some kind of life the reverse of
corporeal, since they have found it to be a life that animates and
quickens every living body, have by consequence striven also,
according as each was able, to prove it immortal, since life cannot
be without life.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.vii-p4">For as to that fifth kind of body,
I know not what, which some have added to the four well-known
elements of the world, and have said that the soul was made of
this, I do not think we need spend time in discussing it in this
place. For either they mean by body what we mean by it, <i>
viz.</i>, that of which a part is less than the whole in extension
of place, and they are to be reckoned among those who have believed
the mind to be corporeal: or if they call either all substance, or
all changeable substance, body, whereas they know that not all
substance is contained in extension of place by any length and
breadth and height, we need not contend with them about a question
of words.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.vii-p5">10. Now, in the case of all these
opinions, any one who sees that the nature of the mind is at once
substance, and yet not corporeal,&#8212;that is, that it does not
occupy a less extension of place with a less part of itself, and a
greater with a greater,&#8212;must needs see at the same time that they
who are of opinion that it is corporeal<note place="end" n="725" id="iv.i.xii.vii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xii.vii-p6"> [The distinction between corporeal

concerning mind, but because they associate with it qualities
without which they are not able to conceive any nature at all. For
if you bid them conceive of existence that is without corporeal
phantasms, they hold it merely nothing. And so the mind would not
seek itself, as though wanting to itself. For what is so present to
knowledge as that which is present to the mind? Or what is so
present to the mind as the mind itself? And hence what is called
&#8220;invention,&#8221; if we consider the origin of the word, what else
does it mean, unless that to find out<note place="end" n="726" id="iv.i.xii.vii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xii.vii-p7"> <i>Invenire</i></p></note> is to &#8220;come into&#8221; that which is

they may be said to be known; since we did not endeavor by seeking
to come into them, that is to invent or find them out. And
therefore, as the mind itself really seeks those things which are
sought by the eyes or by any other sense of the body (for the mind
directs even the carnal sense, and then finds out or invents, when
that sense comes to the things which are sought); so, too, it finds
out or invents other things which it ought to know, not with the
medium of corporeal sense, but through itself, when it &#8220;comes
into&#8221; them; and this, whether in the case of the higher substance
that is in God, or of the other parts of the soul; just as it does
when it judges of bodily images themselves, for it finds these
within, in the soul, impressed through the body.</p>

Inquires into Itself. Whence Comes the Error of the Soul Concerning
Itself.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.viii-p2">11. It is then a wonderful
question, in what manner the soul seeks and finds itself; at what
it aims in order to seek, or whither it comes, that it may come
into or find out. For what is so much in the mind as the mind
itself? But because it is <i>in</i> those things which it thinks of
with love, and is wont to be in sensible, that is, in corporeal
things with love, it is unable to be in itself without the images
of those corporeal things. And hence shameful error arises to block
its way, whilst it cannot separate from itself the images of
sensible things, so as to see itself alone. For they have
marvellously cohered with it by the close adhesion of love. And
herein consists its uncleanness; since, while it strives to think
of itself alone, it fancies itself to be that, without which it
cannot think of itself. When, therefore, it is bidden to become
acquainted with itself, let it not seek itself as though it were
withdrawn from itself; but let it withdraw that which it has added
to itself. For itself lies more deeply within, not only than those
sensible things, which are clearly without, but also than the
images of them; which are indeed in some part of the soul, <i>
viz</i>., that which beasts also have, although these want
understanding, which is proper to the mind. As therefore the mind
is within, it goes forth in some sort from itself, when it exerts
the affection of love towards these, as it were, footprints of many
acts of attention. And these footprints are, as it were, imprinted
on the memory, at the time when the corporeal things which are
without are perceived in such way, that even when those corporeal
things are absent, yet the images of them are at hand to those who
think of them. Therefore let the mind become acquainted with
itself, and not seek itself as if it were absent; but fix upon
itself the act of [voluntary] attention, by which it was wandering
among other things, and let it think of itself. So it will see that
at no time did it ever not love itself, at no time did it ever not
know itself; but by loving another thing together with itself it
has confounded itself with it, and in some sense has grown one with
it. And so, while it embraces diverse things, as though they were
one, it has come to think those things to be one which are
diverse.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.ix-p2">12. Let it not therefore seek to
discern itself as though absent, but take pains to discern itself
as present. Nor let it take knowledge of itself as if it did not
know itself, but let it distinguish itself from that which it knows
to be another. For how will it take pains to obey that very precept
which is given it, &#8220;Know thyself,&#8221; if it knows not either what
&#8220;know&#8221; means or what &#8220;thyself&#8221; means? But if it knows both,
then it knows also itself. Since &#8220;know thyself&#8221; is not so said
to the mind as is &#8220;Know the cherubim and the seraphim;&#8221; for
they are absent, and we believe concerning them, and according to
that belief they are declared to be certain celestial powers. Nor
yet again as it is said, Know the will of that man: for this it is
not within our reach to perceive at all, either by sense or
understanding, unless by corporeal signs actually set forth; and
this in such a way that we rather believe than understand. Nor
again as it is said to a man, Behold thy own face; which he can
only do in a looking-glass. For even our own face itself is out of
the reach of our own seeing it; because it is not there where our
look can be directed. But when it is said to the mind, Know
thyself; then it knows itself by that very act by which it
understands the word &#8220;thyself;&#8221; and this for no other reason
than that it is present to itself. But if it does not understand
what is said, then certainly it does not do as it is bid to do. And
therefore it is bidden to do that thing which it does do, when it
understands the very precept that bids it.</p>

<div4 type="Chapter" title="Every Mind Knows Certainly Three Things Concerning Itself&#8212;That It Understands, that It Is, and that It Lives." n="10" shorttitle="Chapter 10" progress="26.35%" prev="iv.i.xii.ix" next="iv.i.xii.xi" id="iv.i.xii.x"><p class="c39" id="iv.i.xii.x-p1">

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.x-p2">13. Let it not then add anything to
that which it knows itself to be, when it is bidden to know itself.
For it knows, at any rate, that this is said to itself; namely, to
the self that is, and that lives, and that understands. But a dead
body also is, and cattle live; but neither a dead body nor cattle
understand. Therefore it so knows that it so is, and that it so
lives, as an understanding is and lives. When, therefore, for
example&#8217;s sake, the mind thinks itself air, it thinks that air
understands; it knows, however, that itself understands, but it
does not know itself to be air, but only thinks so. Let it separate
that which it thinks itself; let it discern that which it knows;
let this remain to it, about which not even have they doubted who
have thought the mind to be this corporeal thing or that. For
certainly every mind does not consider 
<pb n="141" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_141.html" id="iv.i.xii.x-Page_141"/>itself to be air; but
some think themselves fire, others the brain, and some one kind of
corporeal thing, others another, as I have mentioned before; yet
all know that they themselves understand, and are, and live; but
they refer understanding to that which they understand, but to be,
and to live, to themselves. And no one doubts, either that no one
understands who does not live, or that no one lives of whom it is
not true that he is; and that therefore by consequence that which
understands both is and lives; not as a dead body is which does not
live, nor as a soul lives which does not understand, but in some
proper and more excellent manner. Further, they know that they
will, and they equally know that no one can will who is not and who
does not live; and they also refer that will itself to something
which they will with that will. They know also that they remember;
and they know at the same time that nobody could remember, unless
he both was and lived; but we refer memory itself also to
something, in that we remember those things. Therefore the
knowledge and science of many things are contained in two of these
three, memory and understanding; but will must be present, that we
may enjoy or use them. For we enjoy things known, in which things
themselves the will finds delight for their own sake, and so
reposes; but we use those things, which we refer to some other
thing which we are to enjoy. Neither is the life of man vicious and
culpable in any other way, than as wrongly using and wrongly
enjoying. But it is no place here to discuss this.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.x-p3">14. But since we treat of the
nature of the mind, let us remove from our consideration all
knowledge which is received from without, through the senses of the
body; and attend more carefully to the position which we have laid
down, that all minds know and are certain concerning themselves.
For men certainly have doubted whether the power of living, of
remembering, of understanding, of willing, of thinking, of knowing,
of judging, be of air, or of fire, or of the brain, or of the
blood, or of atoms, or besides the usual four elements of a fifth
kind of body, I know not what; or whether the combining or
tempering together of this our flesh itself has power to accomplish
these things. And one has attempted to establish this, and another
to establish that. Yet who ever doubts that he himself lives, and
remembers, and understands, and wills, and thinks, and knows, and
judges? Seeing that even if he doubts, he lives; if he doubts, he
remembers why he doubts; if he doubts, he understands that he
doubts; if he doubts, he wishes to be certain; if he doubts, he
thinks; if he doubts, he knows that he does not know; if he doubts,
he judges that he ought not to assent rashly. Whosoever therefore
doubts about anything else, ought not to doubt of all these things;
which if they were not, he would not be able to doubt of
anything.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.x-p4">15. They who think the mind to be
either a body or the combination or tempering of the body, will
have all these things to seem to be in a subject, so that the
substance is air, or fire, or some other corporeal thing, which
they think to be the mind; but that the understanding
(<i>intelligentia</i>) is in this corporeal thing as its quality,
so that this corporeal thing is the subject, but the understanding
is in the subject: <i>viz</i>. that the mind is the subject, which
they judge to be a corporeal thing, but the understanding
[intelligence], or any other of those things which we have
mentioned as certain to us, is in that subject. They also hold
nearly the same opinion who deny the mind itself to be body, but
think it to be the combination or tempering together of the body;
for there is this difference, that the former say that the mind
itself is the substance, in which the understanding [intelligence]
is, as in a subject; but the latter say that the mind itself is in
a subject, <i>viz.</i> in the body, of which it is the combination
or tempering together. And hence, by consequence, what else can
they think, except that the understanding also is in the same body
as in a subject?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.x-p5">16. And all these do not perceive
that the mind knows itself, even when it seeks for itself, as we
have already shown. But nothing is at all rightly said to be known
while its substance is not known. And therefore, when the mind
knows itself, it knows its own substance; and when it is certain
about itself, it as certain about its own substance. But it is
certain about itself, as those things which are said above prove
convincingly; although it is not at all certain whether itself is
air, or fire, or some body, or some function of body. Therefore it
is not any of these. And to that whole which is bidden to know
itself, belongs this, that it is certain that it is not any of
those things of which it is uncertain, and is certain that it is
that only, which only it is certain that it is. For it thinks in
this way of fire, or air, and whatever else of the body it thinks
of. Neither can it in any way be brought to pass that it should so
think that which itself is, as it thinks that which itself is not.
Since it thinks all these things through an imaginary phantasy,
whether fire, or air, or this or that body, or that part or
combination and tempering together of the body: nor assuredly is it
said to be all those things, but <pb n="142" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_142.html" id="iv.i.xii.x-Page_142"/>some one of them. But if it
were any one of them, it would think this one in a different manner
from the rest <i>viz</i>. not through an imaginary phantasy, as
absent things are thought, which either themselves or some of like
kind have been touched by the bodily sense; but by some inward, not
feigned, but true presence (for nothing is more present to it than
itself); just as it thinks that itself lives, and remembers, and
understands, and wills. For it knows these things in itself, and
does not imagine them as though it had touched them by the sense
outside itself, as corporeal things are touched. And if it attaches
nothing to itself from the thought of these things, so as to think
itself to be something of the kind, then whatsoever remains to it
from itself that alone is itself.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.xi-p2">17. Putting aside, then, for a
little while all other things, of which the mind is certain
concerning itself, let us especially consider and discuss these
three&#8212;memory, understanding, will. For we may commonly discern in
these three the character of the abilities of the young also; since
the more tenaciously and easily a boy remembers, and the more
acutely he understands, and the more ardently he studies, the more
praiseworthy is he in point of ability. But when the question is
about any one&#8217;s learning, then we ask not how solidly and easily
he remembers, or how shrewdly he understands; but what it is that
he remembers, and what it is that he understands. And because the
mind is regarded as praiseworthy, not only as being learned, but
also as being good, one gives heed not only to what he remembers
and what he understands, but also to what he wills (<i>velit</i>);
not how ardently he wills, but first what it is he wills, and then
how greatly he wills it. For the mind that loves eagerly is then to
be praised, when it loves that which ought to be loved eagerly.
Since, then, we speak of these three&#8212;ability, knowledge,
use&#8212;the first of these is to be considered under the three heads,
of what a man can do in memory, and understanding, and will. The
second of them is to be considered in regard to that which any one
has in his memory and in his understanding, which he has attained
by a studious will. But the third, <i>viz</i>. use, lies in the
will, which handles those things that are contained in the memory
and understanding, whether it refer them to anything further, or
rest satisfied with them as an end. For to use, is to take up
something into the power of the will; and to enjoy, is to use with
joy, not any longer of hope, but of the actual thing. Accordingly,
every one who enjoys, uses; for he takes up something into the
power of the will, wherein he also is satisfied as with an end. But
not every one who uses, enjoys, if he has sought after that, which
he takes up into the power of the will, not on account of the thing
itself, but on account of something else.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.xi-p3">18. Since, then, these three,
memory, understanding, will, are not three lives, but one life; nor
three minds, but one mind; it follows certainly that neither are
they three substances, but one substance. Since memory, which is
called life, and mind, and substance, is so called in respect to
itself; but it is called memory, relatively to something. And I
should say the same also of understanding and of will, since they
are called understanding and will relatively to something; but each
in respect to itself is life, and mind, and essence. And hence
these three are one, in that they are one life, one mind, one
essence; and whatever else they are severally called in respect to
themselves, they are called also together, not plurally, but in the
singular number. But they are three, in that wherein they are
mutually referred to each other; and if they were not equal, and
this not only each to each, but also each to all, they certainly
could not mutually contain each other; for not only is each
contained by each, but also all by each. For I remember that I have
memory and understanding, and will; and I understand that I
understand, and will, and remember; and I will that I will, and
remember, and understand; and I remember together my whole memory,
and understanding, and will. For that of my memory which I do not
remember, is not in my memory; and nothing is so much in the memory
as memory itself. Therefore I remember the whole memory. Also,
whatever I understand I know that I understand, and I know that I
will whatever I will; but whatever I know I remember. Therefore I
remember the whole of my understanding, and the whole of my will.
Likewise, when I understand these three things, I understand them
together as whole. For there is none of things intelligible which I
do not understand, except what I do not know; but what I do not
know, I neither remember, nor will. Therefore, whatever of things
intelligible I do not understand, it follows also that I neither
remember nor will. And whatever of things intelligible I remember
and will, it fol<pb n="143" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_143.html" id="iv.i.xii.xi-Page_143"/>lows that I understand. My will
also embraces my whole understanding and my whole memory whilst I
use the whole that I understand and remember. And, therefore, while
all are mutually comprehended by each, and as wholes, each as a
whole is equal to each as a whole, and each as a whole at the same
time to all as wholes; and these three are one, one life, one mind,
one essence.<note place="end" n="728" id="iv.i.xii.xi-p3.1"><p id="iv.i.xii.xi-p4"> [This ternary of memory, understanding, and will, is a
better analogue to the Trinity than the preceding one in chapter
IX&#8212;namely, mind, knowledge, and love. Memory, understanding, and
will have equal substantiality, while mind, knowledge, and love
have not. The former are three <i>faculties</i>, in each of which
is the whole mind or spirit. The memory is the whole mind as
remembering; the understanding is the whole mind as cognizing; and
the will is the whole mind as determining. The one essence of the
mind is in each of these three modes, each of which is distinct
from the others; and yet there are not three essences or minds. In
the other ternary, of mind, knowledge, and love, the last two are
not faculties but single <i>acts</i> of the mind. A particular act
of cognition is not the whole mind in the <i>general</i> mode of
cognition. This would make it a faculty. A particular act of
loving, or of willing, is not the whole mind in the <i>general</i>
mode of loving, or of willing. This would make the momentary and
transient act a permanent faculty. This ternary fails, as we have
noticed in a previous annotation (IX. ii. 2), in that only the mind
is a substance.</p>

<p class="MsoEndnoteText" id="iv.i.xii.xi-p5">The ternary of
memory, understanding, and will is an adequate analogue to the
Trinity in respect to equal substantiality. But it fails when the
separate <i>consciousness</i> of the Trinitarian distinctions is
brought into consideration. The three faculties of memory,
understanding, and will, are not so objective to each other as to
admit of three forms of consciousness, of the use of the personal
pronouns, and of the personal actions that are ascribed to the
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It also fails, in that these three
are not <i>all</i> the modes of the mind. There are other
faculties: <i>e. g.</i>, the imagination. The whole essence of the
mind is in this also.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.xii-p2">19. Are we, then, now to go upward,
with whatever strength of purpose we may, to that chiefest and
highest essence, of which the human mind is an inadequate image,
yet an image? Or are these same three things to be yet more
distinctly made plain in the soul, by means of those things which
we receive from without, through the bodily sense, wherein the
knowledge of corporeal things is impressed upon us in time? Since
we found the mind itself to be such in its own memory, and
understanding, and will, that since it was understood always to
know and always to will itself, it was understood also at the same
time always to remember itself, always to understand and love
itself, although not always to think of itself as <i>separate</i>
from those things which are not itself; and hence its memory of
itself, and understanding of itself, are with difficult discerned
in it. For in this case, where these two things are very closely
conjoined, and one is not preceded by the other by any time at all,
it looks as if they were not two things, but one called by two
names; and love itself is not so plainly felt to exist when the
sense of need does not disclose it, since what is loved is always
at hand. And hence these things may be more lucidly set forth, even
to men of duller minds, if such topics are treated of as are
brought within reach of the mind in time, and happen to it in time;
while it remembers what it did not remember before, and sees what
it did not see before, and loves what it did not love before. But
this discussion demands now another beginning, by reason of the
measure of the present book.</p>

No</span> one doubts that, as the inner man is
endued with understanding, so is the outer with bodily sense. Let
us try, then, if we can, to discover in this outer man also, some
trace, however slight, of the Trinity, not that itself also is in
the same manner the image of God. For the opinion of the apostle is
evident, which declares the <i>inner</i> man to be renewed in the
knowledge of God after the image of Him that created him:<note place="end" n="729" id="iv.i.xiii.i-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiii.i-p3"> <scripRef passage="Col. iii. 10" id="iv.i.xiii.i-p3.2" parsed="|Col|3|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.3.10">Col. iii. 10</scripRef></p></note> whereas he

then, so far as we can, in that which perishes, some image of the
Trinity, if not so express, yet perhaps more easy to be discerned.
For that outer man also is not called man to no purpose, but
because there is in it some likeness of the inner man. And owing to
that very order of our condition whereby we are made mortal and
fleshly, we handle things visible more easily and more familiarly
than things intelligible; since the former are outward, the latter
inward; and the former are perceived by the bodily sense, the
latter are understood by the mind; and we ourselves, <i>i.e.</i>
our minds, are not sensible things, that is, bodies, but
intelligible things, since we are life. And yet, as I said, we are
so familiarly occupied with bodies, and our thought has projected
itself outwardly with so wonderful a proclivity towards bodies,
that, when it has been withdrawn from the uncertainty of things
corporeal, that it may be fixed with a much more certain and stable
knowledge in that which is spirit, it flies back to those bodies,
and seeks rest there whence it has drawn weakness. And to this its
feebleness we must suit our argument; so that, if we would endeavor
at any time to distinguish more aptly, and intimate more readily,
the inward spiritual thing, we must take examples of likenesses
from outward things pertaining to the body. The outer man, then,
endued as he is with the bodily sense, is conversant with bodies.
And this bodily sense, as is easily observed, is fivefold; seeing,
hearing, smelling, tasting, touching. But it is both a good deal of
trouble, and is not necessary, that we should inquire of all these
five senses about that which we seek. For that which one of them
declares to us, holds also good in the rest. Let us use, then,
principally the testimony of the eyes. For this bodily <pb n="145" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_145.html" id="iv.i.xiii.i-Page_145"/>sense far
surpasses the rest; and in proportion to its difference of kind, is
nearer to the sight of the mind.</p>

Sight, Which Differ in Their Own Nature. In What Manner from a
Visible Thing Vision is Produced, or the Image of that Thing Which
is Seen. The Matter is Shown More Clearly by an Example. How These
Three Combine in One.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.ii-p2">2. When, then, we see any corporeal
object, these three things, as is most easy to do, are to be
considered and distinguished: First, the object itself which we
see; whether a stone, or flame, or any other thing that can be seen
by the eyes; and this certainly might exist also already before it
was seen; next, vision or the act of seeing, which did not exist
before we perceived the object itself which is presented to the
sense; in the third place, that which keeps the sense of the eye in
the object seen, so long as it is seen, <i>viz</i>. the attention
of the mind. In these three, then, not only is there an evident
distinction, but also a diverse nature. For, first, that visible
body is of a far different nature from the sense of the eyes,
through the incidence of which sense upon it vision arises. And
what plainly is vision itself other than perception informed by
that thing which is perceived? Although there is no vision if the
visible object be withdrawn, nor could there be any vision of the
kind at all if there were no body that could be seen; yet the body
by which the sense of the eyes is informed, when that body is seen,
and the form itself which is imprinted by it upon the sense, which
is called vision, are by no means of the same substance. For the
body that is seen is, in its own nature, separable; but the sense,
which was already in the living subject, even before it saw what it
was able to see, when it fell in with something visible,&#8212;or the
vision which comes to be in the sense from the visible body when
now brought into connection with it and seen,&#8212;the sense, then, I
say, or the vision, that is, the sense informed from without,
belongs to the nature of the living subject, which is altogether
other than that body which we perceive by seeing, and by which the
sense is not so formed as to be sense, but as to be vision. For
unless the sense were also in us before the presentation to us of
the sensible object, we should not differ from the blind, at times
when we are seeing nothing, whether in darkness, or when our eyes
are closed. But we differ from them in this, that there is in us,
even when we are not seeing, that whereby we are able to see, which
is called the sense; whereas this is not in them, nor are they
called blind for any other reason than because they have it not.
Further also, that attention of the mind which keeps the sense in
that thing which we see, and connects both, not only differs from
that visible thing in its nature; in that the one is mind, and the
other body; but also from the sense and the vision itself: since
this attention is the act of the mind alone; but the sense of the
eyes is called a bodily sense, for no other reason than because the
eyes themselves also are members of the body; and although an
inanimate body does not perceive, yet the soul commingled with the
body perceives through a corporeal instrument, and that instrument
is called sense. And this sense, too, is cut off and extinguished
by suffering on the part of the body, when any one is blinded;
while the mind remains the same; and its attention, since the eyes
are lost, has not, indeed, the sense of the body which it may join,
by seeing, to the body without it, and so fix its look thereupon
and see it, yet by the very effort shows that, although the bodily
sense be taken away, itself can neither perish nor be diminished.
For there remains unimpaired a desire [<i>appetitus</i>] of seeing,
whether it can be carried into effect or not. These three, then,
the body that is seen, and vision itself, and the attention of mind
which joins both together, are manifestly distinguishable, not only
on account of the properties of each, but also on account of the
difference of their natures.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.ii-p3">3. And since, in this case, the
sensation does not proceed from that body which is seen, but from
the body of the living being that perceives, with which the soul is
tempered together in some wonderful way of its own; yet vision is
produced, that is, the sense itself is informed, by the body which
is seen; so that now, not only is there the power of sense, which
can exist also unimpaired even in darkness, provided the eyes are
sound, but also a sense actually informed, which is called vision.
Vision, then, is produced from a thing that is visible; but not
from that alone, unless there be present also one who sees.
Therefore vision is produced from a thing that is visible, together
with one who sees; in such way that, on the part of him who sees,
there is the sense of seeing and the intention of looking and
gazing at the object; while yet that information of the sense,
which is called vision, is imprinted only by the body which is
seen, that is, by some visible thing; which being taken away, that
form <pb n="146" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_146.html" id="iv.i.xiii.ii-Page_146"/>remains no more which was in the sense so long as that
which was seen was present: yet the sense itself remains, which
existed also before anything was perceived; just as the trace of a
thing in water remains so long as the body itself, which is
impressed on it, is in the water; but if this has been taken away,
there will no longer be any such trace, although the water remains,
which existed also before it took the form of that body. And
therefore we cannot, indeed, say that a visible thing produces the
sense; yet it produces the form, which is, as it were, its own
likeness, which comes to be in the sense, when we perceive anything
by seeing. But we do not distinguish, through the same sense, the
form of the body which we see, from the form which is produced by
it in the sense of him who sees; since the union of the two is so
close that there is no room for distinguishing them. But we
rationally infer that we could not have sensation at all, unless
some similitude of the body seen was wrought in our own sense. For
when a ring is imprinted on wax, it does not follow that no image
is produced, because we cannot discern it unless when it has been
separated. But since, after the wax is separated, what was made
remains, so that it can be seen; we are on that account easily
persuaded that there was already also in the wax a form impressed
from the ring before it was separated from it. But if the ring were
imprinted upon a fluid, no image at all would appear when it was
withdrawn; and yet none the less for this ought the reason to
discern that there was in that fluid before the ring was withdrawn
a form of the ring produced from the ring, which is to be
distinguished from that form which is in the ring, whence that form
was produced which ceases to be when the ring is withdrawn,
although that in the ring remains, whence the other was produced.
And so the [sensuous] perception of the eyes may not be supposed to
contain no image of the body, which is seen as long as it is seen,
[merely] because when that is withdrawn the image does not remain.
And hence it is very difficult to persuade men of duller mind that
an image of the visible thing is formed in our sense, when we see
it, and that this same form is vision.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.ii-p4">4. But if any perhaps attend to
what I am about to mention, they will find no such trouble in this
inquiry. Commonly, when we have looked for some little time at a
light, and then shut our eyes, there seem to play before our eyes
certain bright colors variously changing themselves, and shining
less and less until they wholly cease; and these we must understand
to be the remains of that form which was wrought in the sense,
while the shining body was seen, and that these variations take
place in them as they slowly and step by step fade away. For the
lattices, too, of windows, should we happen to be gazing at them,
appear often in these colors; so that it is evident that our sense
is affected by such impressions from that thing which is seen. That
form therefore existed also while we were seeing, and at that time
it was more clear and express. But it was then closely joined with
the species of that thing which was being perceived, so that it
could not be at all distinguished from it; and this was vision
itself. Why, even when the little flame of a lamp is in some way,
as it were, doubled by the divergent rays of the eyes, a twofold
vision comes to pass, although the thing which is seen is one. For
the same rays, as they shoot forth each from its own eye, are
affected severally, in that they are not allowed to meet evenly and
conjointly, in regarding that corporeal thing, so that one combined
view might be formed from both. And so, if we shut one eye, we
shall not see two flames, but one as it really is. But why, if we
shut the left eye, that appearance ceases to be seen, which was on
the right; and if, in turn, we shut the right eye, that drops out
of existence which was on the left, is a matter both tedious in
itself, and not necessary at all to our present subject to inquire
and discuss. For it is enough for the business in hand to consider,
that unless some image, precisely like the thing we perceive, were
produced in our sense, the appearance of the flame would not be
doubled according to the number of the eyes; since a certain way of
perceiving has been employed, which could separate the union of
rays. Certainly nothing that is really single can be seen as if it
were double by one eye, draw it down, or press, or distort it as
you please, if the other is shut.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.ii-p5">5. The case then being so, let us
remember how these three things, although diverse in nature, are
tempered together into a kind of unity; that is, the form of the
body which is seen, and the image of it impressed on the sense,
which is vision or sense informed, and the will of the mind which
applies the sense to the sensible thing, and retains the vision
itself in it. The first of these, that is, the visible thing
itself, does not belong to the nature of the living being, except
when we discern our own body. But the second belongs to that nature
to this extent, that it is wrought in the body, and through the
body in the soul; for it is wrought in the sense, which is neither
without the body nor without the soul. But the third is of the soul
alone, <pb n="147" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_147.html" id="iv.i.xiii.ii-Page_147"/>because it is the will. Although then the substances of
these three are so different, yet they coalesce into such a unity
that the two former can scarcely be distinguished, even with the
intervention of the reason as judge, namely the form of the body
which is seen, and the image of it which is wrought in the sense,
that is, vision. And the will so powerfully combines these two, as
both to apply the sense, in order to be informed, to that thing
which is perceived, and to retain it when informed in that thing.
And if it is so vehement that it can be called love, or desire, or
lust, it vehemently affects also the rest of the body of the living
being; and where a duller and harder matter does not resist,
changes it into like shape and color. One may see the little body
of a chameleon vary with ready change, according to the colors
which it sees. And in the case of other animals, since their
grossness of flesh does not easily admit change, the offspring, for
the most part, betray the particular fancies of the mothers,
whatever it is that they have beheld with special delight. For the
more tender, and so to say, the more formable, are the primary
seeds, the more effectually and capably they follow the bent of the
soul of the mother, and the phantasy that is wrought in it through
that body, which it has greedily beheld. Abundant instances might
be adduced, but one is sufficient, taken from the most trustworthy
books; <i>viz</i>. what Jacob did, that the sheep and goats might
give birth to offspring of various colors, by placing variegated
rods before them in the troughs of water for them to look at as
they drank, at the time they had conceived.<note place="end" n="731" id="iv.i.xiii.ii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiii.ii-p6"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xxx. 37-41" id="iv.i.xiii.ii-p6.2" parsed="|Gen|30|37|30|41" osisRef="Bible:Gen.30.37-Gen.30.41">Gen. xxx. 37&#8211;41</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.iii-p2">6. The rational soul, however,
lives in a degenerate fashion, when it lives according to a trinity
of the <i>outer</i> man; that is, when it applies to those things
which form the bodily sense from without, not a praiseworthy will,
by which to refer them to some useful end, but a base desire, by
which to cleave to them. Since even if the form of the body, which
was corporeally perceived, be withdrawn, its likeness remains in
the memory, to which the will may again direct its eye, so as to be
formed thence from within, as the sense was formed from without by
the presentation of the sensible body. And so that trinity is
produced from memory, from internal vision, and from the will which
unites both. And when these three things are combined into one,
from that combination<note place="end" n="732" id="iv.i.xiii.iii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiii.iii-p3"> <i>Coactus</i></p></note> itself they are called
conception.<note place="end" n="733" id="iv.i.xiii.iii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiii.iii-p4"> <i>Cogitatio</i></p></note> And in these
three there is no longer any diversity of substance. For neither is
the sensible body there, which is altogether distinct from the
nature of the living being, nor is the bodily sense there informed
so as to produce vision, nor does the will itself perform its
office of applying the sense, that is to be informed, to the
sensible body, and of retaining it in it when informed; but in
place of that bodily species which was perceived from without,
there comes the memory retaining that species which the soul has
imbibed through the bodily sense; and in place of that vision which
was outward when the sense was informed through the sensible body,
there comes a similar vision within, while the eye of the mind is
informed from that which the memory retains, and the corporeal
things that are thought of are absent; and the will itself, as
before it applied the sense yet to be informed to the corporeal
thing presented from without, and united it thereto when informed,
so now converts the vision of the recollecting mind to memory, in
order that the mental sight may be informed by that which the
memory has retained, and so there may be in the conception a like
vision. And as it was the reason that distinguished the visible
appearance by which the bodily sense was informed, from the
similitude of it, which was wrought in the sense when informed in
order to produce vision (otherwise they had been so united as to be
thought altogether one and the same); so, although that phantasy
also, which arises from the mind thinking of the appearance of a
body that it has seen, consists of the similitude of the body which
the memory retains, together with that which is thence formed in
the eye of the mind that recollects; yet it so seems to be one and
single, that it can only be discovered to be two by the judgment of
reason, by which we understand that which remains in the memory,
even when we think it from some other source, to be a different
thing from that which is brought into being when we remember, that
is, come back again to the memory, and there find the same
appearance. And if this were not now there, we should say that we
had so forgotten as to be altogether unable to recollect. And if
the eye of him who recollects were not informed from that thing
which was in the memory, the vision of the thinker could in no way
take place; but the conjunction of both, that is, of that which the
memory retains, and of that which is thence expressed so as to
inform the eye of him who recollects, makes them ap<pb n="148" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_148.html" id="iv.i.xiii.iii-Page_148"/>pear as if
they were one, because they are exceedingly like. But when the eye
of the concipient is turned away thence, and has ceased to look at
that which was perceived in the memory, then nothing of the form
that was impressed thereon will remain in that eye, and it will be
informed by that to which it had again been turned, so as to bring
about another conception. Yet that remains which it has left in the
memory, to which it may again be turned when we recollect it, and
being turned thereto may be informed by it, and become one with
that whence it is informed.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.iv-p2">7. But if that will which moves to
and fro, hither and thither, the eye that is to be informed, and
unites it when formed, shall have wholly converged to the inward
phantasy, and shall have absolutely turned the mind&#8217;s eye from
the presence of the bodies which lie around the senses, and from
the very bodily senses themselves, and shall have wholly turned it
to that image, which is perceived within; then so exact a likeness
of the bodily species expressed from the memory is presented, that
not even reason itself is permitted to discern whether the body
itself is seen without, or only something of the kind thought of
within. For men sometimes either allured or frightened by over-much
thinking of visible things, have even suddenly uttered words
accordingly, as if in real fact they were engaged in the very midst
of such actions or sufferings. And I remember some one telling me
that he was wont to perceive in thought, so distinct and as it were
solid, a form of a female body, as to be moved, as though it were a
reality. Such power has the soul over its own body, and such
influence has it in turning and changing the quality of its
[corporeal] garment; just as a man may be affected when clothed, to
whom his clothing sticks. It is the same kind of affection, too,
with which we are beguiled through imaginations in sleep. But it
makes a very great difference, whether the senses of the body are
lulled to torpor, as in the case of sleepers, or disturbed from
their inward structure, as in the case of madmen, or distracted in
some other mode, as in that of diviners or prophets; and so from
one or other of these causes, the intention of the mind is forced
by a kind of necessity upon those images which occur to it, either
from memory, or by some other hidden force through certain
spiritual commixtures of a similarly spiritual substance: or
whether, as sometimes happens to people in health and awake, that
the will occupied by thought turns itself away from the senses, and
so informs the eye of the mind by various images of sensible
things, as though those sensible things themselves were actually
perceived. But these impressions of images not only take place when
the will is directed upon such things by desiring them, but also
when, in order to avoid and guard against them, the mind is carried
away to look upon these very thing so as to <i>flee</i> from them.
And hence, not only desire, but fear, causes both the bodily eye to
be informed by the sensible things themselves, and the mental eye
(<i>acies</i>) by the images of those sensible things. Accordingly,
the more vehement has been either fear or desire, the more
distinctly is the eye informed, whether in the case of him who
[sensuously] perceives by means of the body that which lies close
to him in place, or in the case of him who conceives from the image
of the body which is contained in the memory. What then a body in
place is to the bodily sense, that, the similitude of a body in
memory is to the eye of the mind; and what the vision of one who
looks at a thing is to that appearance of the body from which the
sense is informed, that, the vision of a concipient is to the image
of the body established in the memory, from which the eye of the
mind is informed; and what the intention of the will is towards a
body seen and the vision to be combined with it, in order that a
certain unity of three things may therein take place, although
their nature is diverse, that, the same intention of the will is
towards combining the image of the body which is in the memory, and
the vision of the concipient, that is, the form which the eye of
the mind has taken in returning to the memory, in order that here
too a certain unity may take place of three things, not now
distinguished by diversity of nature, but of one and the same
substance; because this whole is within, and the whole is one
mind.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.v-p2">8. But as, when [both] the form and
species of a body have perished, the will cannot recall to it the
sense of perceiving; so, when the image which memory bears is
blotted out by forgetfulness, the will will be unable to
force <pb n="149" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_149.html" id="iv.i.xiii.v-Page_149"/>back the eye of the mind by recollection, so as to be
formed thereby. But because the mind has great power to imagine not
only things forgotten, but also things that it never saw, or
experienced, either by increasing, or diminishing, or changing, or
compounding, after its pleasure, those which have not dropped out
of its remembrance, it often imagines things to be such as either
it knows they are not, or does not know that they are. And in this
case we have to take care, lest it either speak falsely that it may
deceive, or hold an opinion so as to be deceived. And if it avoid
these two evils, then imagined phantasms do not hinder it: just as
sensible things experienced or retained by memory do not hinder it,
if they are neither passionately sought for when pleasant, nor
basely shunned when unpleasant. But when the will leaves better
things, and greedily wallows in these, then it becomes unclean; and
they are so thought of hurtfully, when they are present, and also
more hurtfully when they are absent. And he therefore lives badly
and degenerately who lives according to the trinity of the <i>
outer</i> man; because it is the purpose of using things sensible
and corporeal, that has begotten also that trinity, which although
it imagines within, yet imagines things without. For no one could
use those things even well, unless the images of things perceived
by the senses were retained in the memory. And unless the will for
the greatest part dwells in the higher and interior things, and
unless that will itself, which is accommodated either to bodies
without, or to the images of them within, refers whatever it
receives in them to a better and truer life, and rests in that end
by gazing at which it judges that those things ought to be done;
what else do we do, but that which the apostle prohibits us from
doing, when he says, &#8220;Be not conformed to this world&#8221;?<note place="end" n="734" id="iv.i.xiii.v-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiii.v-p3"> <scripRef passage="Rom. xii. 2" id="iv.i.xiii.v-p3.2" parsed="|Rom|12|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.12.2">Rom. xii. 2</scripRef></p></note> And
therefore that trinity is not an image of God since it is produced
in the mind itself through the bodily sense, from the lowest, that
is, the corporeal creature, than which the mind is higher. Yet
neither is it altogether dissimilar: for what is there that has not
a likeness of God, in proportion to its kind and measure, seeing

He Himself is supremely good? In so far, therefore, as anything
that is, is good, in so far plainly it has still some likeness of
the supreme good, at however great a distance; and if a natural
likeness, then certainly a right and well-ordered one; but if a
faulty likeness, then certainly a debased and perverse one. For
even souls in their very sins strive after nothing else but some
kind of likeness of God, in a proud and preposterous, and, so to
say, slavish liberty. So neither could our first parents have been

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.v-p6">9. Of that vision then; that is, of
the form which is wrought in the sense of him who sees; the form of
the bodily thing from which it is wrought, is, as it were, the
parent. But it is not a true parent; whence neither is that a true
offspring; for it is not altogether born therefrom, since something
else is applied to the bodily thing in order that it may be formed
from it, namely, the sense of him who sees. And for this reason, to
love this is to be estranged.<note place="end" n="737" id="iv.i.xiii.v-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiii.v-p7"> <i>Vid. Retract</i>. Bk. II. c. 15, where Augustin adds that it is possible

both, <i>viz</i>. the quasi-parent and the quasi-child, is more
spiritual than either of them. For that bodily thing which is
discerned, is not spiritual at all. But the vision which comes into
existence in the sense, has something spiritual mingled with it,
since it cannot come into existence without the soul. But it is not
wholly spiritual; since that which is formed is a sense of the
body. Therefore the will which unites both is confessedly more
spiritual, as I have said; and so it begins to suggest
(<i>insinuare</i>), as it were, the person of the Spirit in the
Trinity. But it belongs more to the sense that is formed, than to
the bodily thing whence it is formed. For the sense and will of an
animate being belongs to the soul, not to the stone or other bodily
thing that is seen. It does not therefore proceed from that bodily
thing as from a parent; yet neither does it proceed from that other
as it were offspring, namely, the vision and form that is in the
sense. For the will existed before the vision came to pass, which
will applied the sense that was to be formed to the bodily thing
that was to be discerned; but it was not yet satisfied. For how
could that which was not yet seen satisfy? And satisfaction means a
will that rests content. And, therefore, we can neither call the
will the quasi-offspring of vision, since it existed before vision;
nor the quasi-parent, since that vision was not formed and
expressed <pb n="150" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_150.html" id="iv.i.xiii.v-Page_150"/>from the will, but from the bodily thing that was
seen.</p>

6.&#8212;Of What Kind We are to Reckon the Rest (Requies), and End
(Finis), of the Will in Vision.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.vi-p2">10. Perhaps we can rightly call
vision the end and rest of the will, only with respect to this one
object [namely, the bodily thing that is visible]. For it will not
will nothing else merely because it sees something which it is now
willing. It is not therefore the whole will itself of the man, of
which the end is nothing else than blessedness; but the will
provisionally directed to this one object, which has as its end in
seeing, nothing but vision, whether it refer the thing seen to any
other thing or not. For if it does not refer the vision to anything
further, but wills only to see this, there can be no question made
about showing that the end of the will is the vision; for it is
manifest. But if it does refer it to anything further, then
certainly it does will something else, and it will not be now a
will merely to see; or if to see, not one to see the particular
thing. Just as, if any one wished to see the scar, that from thence
he might learn that there had been a wound; or wished to see the
window, that through the window he might see the passers-by: all
these and other such acts of will have their own proper [proximate]
ends, which are referred to that [final] end of the will by which
we will to live blessedly, and to attain to that life which is not
referred to anything else, but suffices of itself to him who loves
it. The will then to see, has as its end vision; and the will to
see this particular thing, has as its end the vision of this
particular thing. Therefore the will to see the scar, desires its
own end, that is, the vision of the scar, and does not reach beyond
it; for the will to prove that there had been a wound, is a
distinct will, although dependent upon that, of which the end also
is to prove that there had been a wound. And the will to see the
window, has as its end the vision of the window; for that is
another and further will which depends upon it, <i>viz</i>. to see
the passers-by through the window, of which also the end is the
vision of the passers-by. But all the several wills that are bound
to each other, are at once right, if that one is good, to which all
are referred; and if that is bad, then all are bad. And so the
connected series of right wills is a sort of road which consists as
it were of certain steps, whereby to ascend to blessedness; but the
entanglement of depraved and distorted wills is a bond by which he
will be bound who thus acts, so as to be cast into outer
darkness.<note place="end" n="738" id="iv.i.xiii.vi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiii.vi-p3"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 22.13" id="iv.i.xiii.vi-p3.1" parsed="|Matt|22|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.13">Matt. xxii. 13</scripRef></p></note> Blessed

the will being in repose, which we call its end, if it is still
referred to something further, as if we should say that the foot is
at rest in walking, when it is placed there, whence yet another
foot may be planted in the direction of the man&#8217;s steps. But if
something so satisfies, that the will acquiesces in it with a
certain delight; it is nevertheless not yet that to which the man
ultimately tends; but this too is referred to something further, so
as to be regarded not as the native country of a citizen, but as a
place of refreshment, or even of stopping, for a
traveller.</p>

<div4 type="Chapter" title="There is Another Trinity in the Memory of Him Who Thinks Over Again What He Has Seen." n="7" shorttitle="Chapter 7" progress="28.25%" prev="iv.i.xiii.vi" next="iv.i.xiii.viii" id="iv.i.xiii.vii"><p class="c39" id="iv.i.xiii.vii-p1">

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xiii.vii-p1.1">Chapter 7.&#8212;There is Another Trinity in the Memory of
Him Who Thinks Over Again What He Has Seen.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.vii-p2">11. But yet again, take the case of
another trinity, more inward indeed than that which is in things
sensible, and in the senses, but which is yet conceived from
thence; while now it is no longer the sense of the body that is
informed from the body, but the eye of the mind that is informed
from the memory, since the species of the body which we perceived
from without has inhered in the memory itself. And that species,
which is in the memory, we call the quasi-parent of that which is
wrought in the phantasy of one who conceives. For it was in the
memory also, before we conceived it, just as the body was in place
also before we [sensuously] perceived it, in order that vision
might take place. But when it is conceived, then from that form
which the memory retains, there is copied in the mind&#8217;s eye
(<i>acie</i>) of him who conceives, and by remembrance is formed,
that species, which is the quasi-offspring of that which the memory
retains. But neither is the one a true parent, nor the other a true
offspring. For the mind&#8217;s vision which is formed from memory when
we think anything by recollection, does not proceed from that
species which we remember as seen; since we could not indeed have
remembered those things, unless we had seen them; yet the mind&#8217;s
eye, which is informed by the recollection, existed also before we
saw the body that we remember; and therefore how much more before
we committed it to memory? Although therefore the form which is
wrought in the mind&#8217;s eye of him who remembers, is wrought
<pb n="151" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_151.html" id="iv.i.xiii.vii-Page_151"/>from
that form which is in the memory; yet the mind&#8217;s eye itself does
not exist from thence, but existed before it. And it follows, that
if the one is not a true parent, neither is the other a true
offspring. But both that quasi-parent and that quasi-offspring
suggest something, whence the inner and truer things may appear
more practically and more certainly.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.vii-p3">12. Further, it is more difficult
to discern clearly, whether the will which connects the vision to
the memory is not either the parent or the offspring of some one of
them; and the likeness and equality of the same nature and
substance cause this difficulty of distinguishing. For it is not
possible to do in this case, as with the sense that is formed from
without (which is easily discerned from the sensible body, and
again the will from both), on account of the difference of nature
which is mutually in all three, and of which we have treated
sufficiently above. For although this trinity, of which we at
present speak, is introduced into the mind from without; yet it is
transacted within, and there is no part of it outside of the nature
of the mind itself. In what way, then, can it be demonstrated that
the will is neither the quasi-parent, nor the quasi-offspring,
either of the corporeal likeness which is contained in the memory,
or of that which is copied thence in recollecting; when it so
unites both in the act of conceiving, as that they appear singly as
one, and cannot be discerned except by reason? It is then first to
be considered that there cannot be any will to remember, unless we
retain in the recesses of the memory either the whole, or some
part, of that thing which we wish to remember. For the very will to
remember cannot arise in the case of a thing which we have
forgotten altogether and absolutely; since we have already
remembered that the thing which we wish to remember is or has been,
in our memory. For example, if I wish to remember what I supped on
yesterday, either I have already remembered that I did sup, or if
not yet this, at least I have remembered something about that time
itself, if nothing else; at all events, I have remembered
yesterday, and that part of yesterday in which people usually sup,
and what supping is. For if I had not remembered anything at all of
this kind, I could not wish to remember what I supped on yesterday.
Whence we may perceive that the will of remembering proceeds,
indeed, from those things which are retained in the memory, with
the addition also of those which, by the act of discerning, are
copied thence through recollection; that is, from the combination
of something which we have remembered, and of the vision which was
thence wrought, when we remembered, in the mind&#8217;s eye of him who
thinks. But the will itself which unites both requires also some
other thing, which is, as it were, close at hand, and adjacent to
him who remembers. There are, then, as many trinities of this kind
as there are remembrances; because there is no one of them wherein
there are not these three things, <i>viz</i>. that which was stored
up in the memory also before it was thought, and that which takes
place in the conception when this is discerned, and the will that
unites both, and from both and itself as a third, completes one
single thing. Or is it rather that we so recognize some one trinity
in this kind, as that we are to speak generally, of whatever
corporeal species lie hidden in the memory, as of a single unity,
and again of the general vision of the mind which remembers and
conceives such things, as of a single unity, to the combination of
which two there is to be joined as a third the will that combines
them, that this whole may be a certain unity made up from
three?</p>

<div4 type="Chapter" title="Different Modes of Conceiving." n="8" shorttitle="Chapter 8" progress="28.46%" prev="iv.i.xiii.vii" next="iv.i.xiii.ix" id="iv.i.xiii.viii"><p class="c39" id="iv.i.xiii.viii-p1">

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xiii.viii-p1.1">Chapter 8.&#8212;Different Modes of Conceiving.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.viii-p2">But since the eye of the mind
cannot look at all things together, in one glance, which the memory
retains, these trinities of thought alternate in a series of
withdrawals and successions, and so that trinity becomes most
innumerably numerous; and yet not infinite, if it pass not beyond
the number of things stored up in the memory. For, although we
begin to reckon from the earliest perception which any one has of
material things through any bodily sense, and even take in also
those things which he has forgotten, yet the number would
undoubtedly be certain and determined, although innumerable. For we
not only call infinite things innumerable, but also those, which,
although finite, exceed any one&#8217;s power of reckoning.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.viii-p3">13. But we can hence perceive a
little more clearly that what the memory stores up and retains is a
different thing from that which is thence copied in the conception
of the man who remembers, although, when both are combined
together, they appear to be one and the same; because we can only
remember just as many species of bodies as we have actually seen,
and so great, and such, as we have actually seen; for the mind
imbibes them into the memory from the bodily sense; whereas the
things seen in conception, although drawn from those things which
are in the memory, yet are multiplied 
<pb n="152" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_152.html" id="iv.i.xiii.viii-Page_152"/>and varied innumerably,
and altogether without end. For I remember, no doubt, but one sun,
because according to the fact, I have seen but one; but if I
please, I conceive of two, or three, or as many as I will; but the
vision of my mind, when I conceive of many, is formed from the same
memory by which I remember one. And I remember it just as large as
I saw it. For if I remember it as larger or smaller than I saw it,
then I no longer remember what I saw, and so I do not remember it.
But because I remember it, I remember it as large as I saw it; yet
I conceive of it as greater or as less according to my will. And I
remember it as I saw it; but I conceive of it as running its course
as I will, and as standing still where I will, and as coming whence
I will, and whither I will. For it is in my power to conceive of it
as square, although I remember it as round; and again, of what
color I please, although I have never seen, and therefore do not
remember, a green sun; and as the sun, so all other things. But
owing to the corporeal and sensible nature of these forms of
things, the mind falls into error when it imagines them to exist
without, in the same mode in which it conceives them within, either
when they have already ceased to exist without, but are still
retained in the memory, or when in any other way also, that which
we remember is formed in the mind, not by faithful recollection,
but after the variations of thought.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.viii-p4">14. Yet it very often happens that
we believe also a true narrative, told us by others, of things
which the narrators have themselves perceived by their senses. And
in this case, when we conceive the things narrated to us, as we
hear them, the eye of the mind does not seem to be turned back to
the memory, in order to bring up visions in our thoughts; for we do
not conceive these things from our own recollection, but upon the
narration of another; and that trinity does not here seem to come
to its completion, which is made when the species lying hid in the
memory, and the vision of the man that remembers, are combined by
will as a third. For I do not conceive that which lay hid in my
memory, but that which I hear, when anything is narrated to me. I
am not speaking of the words themselves of the speaker, lest any
one should suppose that I have gone off to that other trinity,
which is transacted without, in sensible things, or in the senses:
but I am conceiving of those species of material things, which the
narrator signifies to me by words and sounds; which species
certainly I conceive of not by remembering, but by hearing. But if
we consider the matter more carefully, even in this case, the limit
of the memory is not overstepped. For I could not even understand
the narrator, if I did not remember generically the individual
things of which he speaks, even although I then hear them for the
first time as connected together in one tale. For he who, for
instance, describes to me some mountain stripped of timber, and
clothed with olive trees, describes it to me who remembers the
species both of mountains, and of timber, and of olive trees; and
if I had forgotten these, I should not know at all of what he was
speaking, and therefore could not conceive that description. And so
it comes to pass, that every one who conceives things corporeal,
whether he himself imagine anything, or hear, or read, either a
narrative of things past, or a foretelling of things future, has
recourse to his memory, and finds there the limit and measure of
all the forms at which he gazes in his thought. For no one can
conceive at all, either a color or a form of body, which he never
saw, or a sound which he never heard, or a flavor which he never
tasted, or a scent which he never smelt, or any touch of a
corporeal thing which he never felt. But if no one conceives
anything corporeal except what he has [sensuously] perceived,
because no one remembers anything corporeal except what he has thus
perceived, then, as is the limit of perceiving in bodies, so is the
limit of thinking in the memory. For the sense receives the species
from that body which we perceive, and the memory from the sense;
but the mental eye of the concipient, from the memory.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.viii-p5">15. Further, as the will applies
the sense to the bodily object, so it applies the memory to the
sense, and the eye of the mind of the concipient to the memory. But
that which harmonizes those things and unites them, itself also
disjoins and separates them, that is, the will. But it separates
the bodily senses from the bodies that are to be perceived, by
movement of the body, either to hinder our perceiving the thing, or
that we may cease to perceive it: as when we avert our eyes from
that which we are unwilling to see, or shut them; so, again, the
ears from sounds, or the nostrils from smells. So also we turn away
from tastes, either by shutting the mouth, or by casting the thing
out of the mouth. In touch, also, we either remove the bodily
thing, that we may not touch what we do not wish, or if we were
already touching it, we fling or push it away. Thus the will acts
by movement of the body, so that the bodily sense shall not be
joined to the sensible things. And it does this according to
its <pb n="153" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_153.html" id="iv.i.xiii.viii-Page_153"/>power; for when it endures hardship in so doing, on
account of the condition of slavish mortality, then torment is the
result, in such wise that nothing remains to the will save
endurance. But the will averts the memory from the sense; when,
through its being intent on something else, it does not suffer
things present to cleave to it. As any one may see, when often we
do not seem to ourselves to have heard some one who was speaking to
us, because we were thinking of something else. But this is a
mistake; for we did hear, but we do not remember, because the words
of the speaker presently slipped out of the perception of our ears,
through the bidding of the will being diverted elsewhere, by which
they are usually fixed in the memory. Therefore, we should say more
accurately in such a case, we do not remember, than, we did not
hear; for it happens even in reading, and to myself very
frequently, that when I have read through a page or an epistle, I
do not know what I have read, and I begin it again. For the purpose
of the will being fixed on something else, the memory was not so
applied to the bodily sense, as the sense itself was applied to the
letters. So, too, any one who walks with the will intent on
something else, does not know where he has got to; for if he had
not seen, he would not have walked thither, or would have felt his
way in walking with greater attention, especially if he was passing
through a place he did not know; yet, because he walked easily,
certainly he saw; but because the memory was not applied to the
sense itself in the same way as the sense of the eyes was applied
to the places through which he was passing, he could not remember
at all even the last thing he saw. Now, to will to turn away the
eye of the mind from that which is in the memory, is nothing else
but not to think thereupon.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.ix-p2">16. In this arrangement, then,
while we begin from the bodily species and arrive finally at the
species which comes to be in the intuition (<i>contuitu</i>) of the
concipient, we find four species born, as it were, step by step one
from the other, the second from the first, the third from the
second, the fourth from the third: since from the species of the
body itself, there arises that which comes to be in the sense of
the percipient; and from this, that which comes to be in the
memory; and from this, that which comes to be in the mind&#8217;s eye
of the concipient. And the will, therefore, thrice combines as it
were parent with offspring: first the species of the body with that
to which it gives birth in the sense of the body; and that again
with that which from it comes to be in the memory; and this also,
thirdly, with that which is born from it in the intuition of the
concipient&#8217;s mind. But the intermediate combination which is the
second, although it is nearer to the first, is yet not so like the
first as the third is. For there are two kinds of vision, the one
of [sensuous] perception (<i>sentientis</i>), the other of
conception (<i>cogitantis</i>). But in order that the vision of
conception may come to be, there is wrought for the purpose, in the
memory, from the vision of [sensuous] perception something like it,
to which the eye of the mind may turn itself in conceiving, as the
glance (<i>acies</i>) of the eyes turns itself in [sensuously]
perceiving to the bodily object. I have, therefore, chosen to put
forward two trinities in this kind: one when the vision of
[sensuous] perception is formed from the bodily object, the other
when the vision of conception is formed from the memory. But I have
refrained from commending an intermediate one; because we do not
commonly call it vision, when the form which comes to be in the
sense of him who perceives, is entrusted to the memory. Yet in all
cases the will does not appear unless as the combiner as it were of
parent and offspring; and so, proceed from whence it may, it can be
called neither parent nor offspring.<note place="end" n="741" id="iv.i.xiii.ix-p2.1"><p id="iv.i.xiii.ix-p3"> [Augustin&#8217;s map of consciousness is as follows: (1).
The corporeal species=the external object (outward appearance).
(2). The sensible species=the sensation (appearance for the sense).
(3). The mental species in its first form=present perception. (4).
The mental species in its second form=remembered perception. These
three &#8220;species&#8221; or appearances of the object: namely,
corporeal, sensible, and mental, according to him, are combined in
one synthesis with the object by the operation of the will. By
&#8220;will,&#8221; he does not mean distinct and separate volitions: but
the spontaneity of the ego&#8212;what Kant denominates the mechanism of
the understanding, seen in the spontaneous employment of the
categories of thought, as the mind ascends from empirical sensation

except what we have [sensuously] perceived, nor conceive except
what we remember; why do we often conceive things that are false,
when certainly we do not remember falsely those things which we
have perceived, unless it be because that will (which I have
already taken pains to show as much as I can to be the uniter and
the separater of things of this kind) leads the vision of the
conceiver that is to be formed, after its own will and
pleasure, <pb n="154" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_154.html" id="iv.i.xiii.x-Page_154"/>through the hidden stores of the memory; and, in order
to conceive [imagine] those things which we do not remember, impels
it to take one thing from hence, and another from thence, from
those which we do remember; and these things combining into one
vision make something which is called false, because it either does
not exist externally in the nature of corporeal things, or does not
seem copied from the memory, in that we do not remember that we
ever saw such a thing. For who ever saw a black swan? And therefore
no one remembers a black swan; yet who is there that cannot
conceive it? For it is easy to apply to that shape which we have
come to know by seeing it, a black color, which we have not the
less seen in other bodies; and because we have seen both, we
remember both. Neither do I remember a bird with four feet, because
I never saw one; but I contemplate such a phantasy very easily, by
adding to some winged shape such as I have seen, two other feet,
such as I have likewise seen.<note place="end" n="742" id="iv.i.xiii.x-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiii.x-p3"> <i>Vid. Retract</i>. 11. xv. 2. [Augustin here says that when he wrote the

conjointly, what we remember to have seen singly, we seem not to
conceive that which we remember; while we really do this under the
law of the memory, whence we take everything which we join together
after our own pleasure in manifold and diverse ways. For we do not
conceive even the very magnitudes of bodies, which magnitudes we
never saw, without help of the memory; for the measure of space to
which our gaze commonly reaches through the magnitude of the world,
is the measure also to which we enlarge the bulk of bodies,
whatever they may be, when we conceive them as great as we can. And
reason, indeed, proceeds still beyond, but phantasy does not follow
her; as when reason announces the infinity of number also, which no
vision of him who conceives according to corporeal things can
apprehend. The same reason also teaches that the most minute atoms
are infinitely divisible; yet when we have come to those slight and
minute particles which we remember to have seen, then we can no
longer behold phantasms more slender and more minute, although
reason does not cease to continue to divide them. So we conceive no
corporeal things, except either those we remember, or from those
things which we remember.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.xi-p2">18. But because those things which
are impressed on the memory singly, can be conceived according to
number, measure seems to belong to the memory, but number to the
vision; because, although the multiplicity of such visions is
innumerable, yet a limit not to be transgressed is prescribed for
each in the memory. Therefore, measure appears in the memory,
number in the vision of things: as there is some measure in visible
bodies themselves, to which measure the sense of those who see is
most numerously adjusted, and from one visible object is formed the
vision of many beholders, so that even a single person sees
commonly a single thing under a double appearance, on account of
the number of his two eyes, as we have laid down above. Therefore
there is some measure in those things whence visions are copied,
but in the visions themselves there is number. But the will which
unites and regulates these things, and combines them into a certain
unity, and does not quietly rest its desire of [sensuously]
perceiving or of conceiving, except in those things from whence the
visions are formed, resembles weight. And therefore I would just
notice by way of anticipation these three things, measure, number,
weight, which are to be perceived in all other things also. In the
meantime, I have now shown as much as I can, and to whom I can,
that the will is the uniter of the visible thing and of the vision;
as it were, of parent and of offspring; whether in [sensuous]
perception or in conception, and that it cannot be called either
parent or offspring. Wherefore time admonishes us to seek for this
same trinity in the inner man, and to strive to pass inwards from
that animal and carnal and (as he is called) outward man, of whom I
have so long spoken. And here we hope to be able to find an image
of God according to the Trinity, He Himself helping our efforts,
who as things themselves show, and as Holy Scripture also
witnesses, has regulated all things in measure, and number, and

now, and let us see where lies, as it were, the boundary line
between the outer and inner man. For whatever we have in the mind
common with the beasts, thus much is rightly said to belong to the
outer man. For the outer man is not to be considered to be the body
only, but with the addition also of a certain peculiar life of the
body, whence the structure of the body derives its vigor, and all
the senses with which he is equipped for the perception of outward
things; and when the images of these outward things already
perceived, that have been fixed in the memory, are seen again by
recollection, it is still a matter pertaining to the outer man. And
in all these things we do not differ from the beasts, except that
in shape of body we are not prone, but upright. And we are
admonished through this, by Him who made us, not to be like the
beasts in that which is our better part&#8212;that is, the mind&#8212;while
we differ from them by the uprightness of the body. Not that we are
to throw our mind into those bodily things which are exalted; for
to seek rest for the will, even in such things, is to prostrate the
mind. But as the body is naturally raised upright to those bodily
things which are most elevated, that is, to things celestial; so
the mind, which is a spiritual substance, must be raised upright to
those things which are most elevated in spiritual things, not by
the elation of pride, but by the dutifulness of
righteousness.</p>

both to perceive things corporeal from without, through the senses
of the body, and to fix them in the memory, and remember them, and
in them to seek after things suitable, and shun things
inconvenient. But to note these things, and to retain them not only
as caught up naturally but also as deliberately committed to
memory, and to imprint them again by recollection and conception
when now just slipping away into forgetfulness; in order that as
conception is formed from that which the memory contains, so also
the contents themselves of the memory may be fixed firmly by
thought: to combine again imaginary objects of sight, by taking
this or that of what the memory remembers, and, as it were, tacking
them to one another: to examine after what manner it is that in
this kind things like the true are to be distinguished from the
true, and this not in things spiritual, but in corporeal things
themselves;&#8212;these acts, and the like, although performed in
reference to things sensible, and those which the mind has deduced
through the bodily senses, yet, as they are combined with reason,
so are not common to men and beasts. But it is the part of the
higher reason to judge of these corporeal things according to
incorporeal and eternal reasons; which, unless they were above the
human mind, would certainly not be unchangeable; and yet, unless
something of our own were subjoined to them, we should not be able
to employ them as our measures by which to judge of corporeal
things. But we judge of corporeal things from the rule of
dimensions and figures, which the mind knows to remain
unchangeably.<note place="end" n="744" id="iv.i.xiv.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.ii-p3"> [The distinction drawn here is

has to do with the handling of corporeal and temporal things, is
indeed rational, in that it is not common to us with the beasts;
but it is drawn, as it were, out of that rational substance of our
mind, by which we depend upon and cleave to the intelligible and
unchangeable truth, and which is deputed to handle and direct the
inferior things. For as among all the beasts there was not found
for the man a help like unto him, unless one were taken from
himself, and formed to be his consort: so for that mind, by which
we consult the supernal and inward truth, there is no like help for
such employment as man&#8217;s nature requires among things corporeal
out of those parts of the soul which we have in common with the
beasts. And so a certain part of our reason, not separated so as to

we seek it in the whole mind, without separating the action of the
reason in things temporal from the contemplation of things eternal,
so as to have further to seek some third thing, by which a trinity
may be completed. But this trinity must needs be so discovered in
the whole nature of the mind, as that even if action upon temporal
things were to be withdrawn, for which work that help is necessary,
with a view to which some part of the mind is diverted in order to
deal with these inferior things, yet a trinity would still be found
in the one mind that is no where parted off; and that when this
distribution has been already made, not only a trinity may be
found, but also an image of God, in that alone which belongs to the

me to advance a probable opinion, who lay it down that a trinity of

female and in their offspring; in that the man himself, as it were,
indicates the person of the Father, but that which has so proceeded
from him as to be born, that of the Son; and so the third person as
of the Spirit, is, they say, the woman, who has so proceeded from
the man as not herself to be either son or daughter,<note place="end" n="746" id="iv.i.xiv.v-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.v-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. ii. 22" id="iv.i.xiv.v-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|2|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.2.22">Gen. ii. 22</scripRef></p></note> although it

is not a son. In this erroneous opinion, then, the only point
probably alleged, and indeed sufficiently shown according to the
faith of the Holy Scripture, is this,&#8212;in the account of the
original creation of the woman,&#8212;that what so comes into existence
from some person as to make another person, cannot in every case be
called a son; since the person of the woman came into existence
from the person of the man, and yet she is not called his daughter.
All the rest of this opinion is in truth so absurd, nay indeed so
false, that it is most easy to refute it. For I pass over such a
thing, as to think the Holy Spirit to be the mother of the Son of
God, and the wife of the Father; since perhaps it may be answered
that these things offend us in carnal things, because we think of
bodily conceptions and births. Although these very things
themselves are most chastely thought of by the pure, to whom all
things are pure; but to the defiled and unbelieving, of whom

Christ, born of a virgin according to the flesh, is a
stumbling-block to some of them. But yet in the case of those
supreme spiritual things, after the likeness of which those kinds
of the inferior creature also are made although most remotely, and
where there is nothing that can be injured and nothing corruptible,
nothing born in time, nothing formed from that which is formless,
or whatever like expressions there may be; yet they ought not to
disturb the sober prudence of any one, lest in avoiding empty
disgust he run into pernicious error. Let him accustom himself so
to find in corporeal things the traces of things spiritual, that
when he begins to ascend upwards from thence, under the guidance of
reason, in order to attain to the unchangeable truth itself through
which these things were made, he may not draw with himself to
things above what he despises in things below. For no one ever
blushed to choose for himself wisdom as a wife, because the name of
wife puts into a man&#8217;s thoughts the corruptible connection which

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p2">6. We do not therefore reject this
opinion, because we fear to think of that holy and inviolable and
unchangeable Love, as the spouse of God the Father, existing as it
does from Him, but not as an offspring in order to beget the Word
by which all things are made; but because divine Scripture
evidently shows it to be false. For God said, &#8220;Let us make man in
our image, after our likeness;&#8221; and a little after it is said,
&#8220;So God created man in the image of God.&#8221;<note place="end" n="749" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. i. 26, 27" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|1|26|1|27" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.26-Gen.1.27">Gen. i. 26, 27</scripRef></p></note> Certainly, in that it is of the
plural number, the word &#8220;our&#8221; would not be rightly used if man
were made in the image of one person, whether of the Father, or of
the Son, or of the Holy Spirit; but because he was made in the
image of the Trinity, on that account it is said, &#8220;After our
image.&#8221; But again, lest we should think that three Gods were to
be believed in the Trinity, whereas the same Trinity is one God, it
is said, &#8220;So God created man in the image of God,&#8221; instead of
saying, &#8220;In His own image.&#8221;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p4">7. For such expressions are
customary in the Scriptures; and yet some persons, while
maintaining the Catholic faith, do not carefully attend to them, in
such wise that they think the words, &#8220;God made man in the image
of God,&#8221; to mean that the Father made man after the image of the
Son; and they thus desire to assert that the Son also is called God
in the divine Scriptures, as if there were not other most true and
clear proofs wherein the Son is called not only God, but also the
true God. For whilst they aim at explaining another difficulty in
this text, they become so entangled that they cannot extricate
themselves. For if the Father made man after the image of the Son,
so that he is not the image of the Father, but of the Son, then the
Son is unlike the Father. But if a pious faith teaches us, as it
does, that the Son is like the Father after an equality of essence,
then that which is made in the likeness of the Son must needs also
be made in the likeness of the Father. Further, if the Father made
man not in His own image, but in the image of His Son, why does He
not say, &#8220;Let us make man after Thy image and likeness,&#8221;
whereas He does say, &#8220;our;&#8221; unless it be because the image of
the Trinity was made in man, that in this way man should be the
image of the one true God, because the Trinity itself is the one
true God? Such expressions are innumerable in the Scriptures, but
it will suffice to have produced these. It is so said in the
Psalms, &#8220;Salvation belongeth unto the Lord; Thy blessing is upon
Thy people;&#8221;<note place="end" n="750" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p5"> <scripRef passage="Ps. iii. 8" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p5.2" parsed="|Ps|3|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.3.8">Ps. iii. 8</scripRef></p></note> as if the

heart of the king&#8217;s enemies.&#8221; Things of this kind are found
more rarely in the New Testament. But yet the apostle says to the
Romans, &#8220;Concerning His Son who was made to Him of the seed of
David according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God
with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the
resurrection of the dead of Jesus Christ our Lord;&#8221;<note place="end" n="753" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p8"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 3, 4" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p8.2" parsed="|Rom|1|3|1|4" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.3-Rom.1.4">Rom. i. 3, 4</scripRef></p></note> as though he
were speaking above of some one <pb n="158" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_158.html" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-Page_158"/>else. For what is meant by the
Son of God declared by the resurrection of the dead of Jesus
Christ, except of the same Jesus Christ who was declared to be Son
of God with power? And as then in this passage, when we are told,
&#8220;the Son of God with power of Jesus Christ,&#8221; or &#8220;the Son of
God according to the spirit of holiness of Jesus Christ,&#8221; or
&#8220;the Son of God by the resurrection of the dead of Jesus
Christ,&#8221; whereas it might have been expressed in the ordinary
way, In His own power, or according to the spirit of His own
holiness, or by the resurrection of His dead, or of their dead: as,
I say, we are not compelled to understand another person, but one
and the same, that is, the person of the Son of God our Lord Jesus
Christ; so, when we are told that &#8220;God made man in the image of
God,&#8221; although it might have been more usual to say, after His
own image, yet we are not compelled to understand any other person
in the Trinity, but the one and selfsame Trinity itself, who is one
God, and after whose image man is made.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p9">8. And since the case stands thus,
if we are to accept the same image of the Trinity, as not in one,
but in three human beings, father and mother and son, then the man
was not made after the image of God before a wife was made for him,
and before they procreated a son; because there was not yet a
trinity. Will any one say there was already a trinity, because,
although not yet in their proper form, yet in their original
nature, both the woman was already in the side of the man, and the
son in the loins of his father? Why then, when Scripture had said,
&#8220;God made man after the image of God,&#8221; did it go on to say,
&#8220;God created him; male and female created He them: and God
blessed them&#8221;?<note place="end" n="754" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p10"> <scripRef passage="Gen. i. 27, 28" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p10.2" parsed="|Gen|1|27|1|28" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.27-Gen.1.28">Gen. i. 27, 28</scripRef></p></note> (Or if it is
to be so divided, &#8220;And God created man,&#8221; so that thereupon is
to be added, &#8220;in the image of God created He him,&#8221; and then
subjoined in the third place, &#8220;male and female created He
them;&#8221; for some have feared to say, He made him male and female,
lest something monstrous, as it were, should be understood, as are
those whom they call hermaphrodites, although even so both might be
understood not falsely in the singular number, on account of that
which is said, &#8220;Two in one flesh.&#8221;) Why then, as I began by
saying, in regard to the nature of man made after the image of God,
does Scripture specify nothing except male and female? Certainly,
in order to complete the image of the Trinity, it ought to have
added also son, although still placed in the loins of his father,
as the woman was in his side. Or was it perhaps that the woman also
had been already made, and that Scripture had combined in a short
and comprehensive statement, that of which it was going to explain
afterwards more carefully, how it was done; and that therefore a
son could not be mentioned, because no son was yet born? As if the
Holy Spirit could not have comprehended this, too, in that brief
statement, while about to narrate the birth of the son afterwards
in its own place; as it narrated afterwards in its own place, that
the woman was taken from the side of the man,<note place="end" n="755" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p10.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p11"> <scripRef passage="Gen. ii. 24, 22" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p11.2" parsed="|Gen|2|24|0|0;|Gen|2|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.2.24 Bible:Gen.2.22">Gen. ii. 24, 22</scripRef></p></note> and yet has not omitted here to

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p2">9. We ought not therefore so to
understand that man is made in the image of the supreme Trinity,
that is, in the image of God, as that the same image should be
understood to be in three human beings; especially when the apostle
says that the man is the image of God, and on that account removes
the covering from his head, which he warns the woman to use,
speaking thus: &#8220;For a man indeed ought not to cover his head,
forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the
glory of the man.&#8221; What then shall we say to this? If the woman
fills up the image of the trinity after the measure of her own
person, why is the man still called that image after she has been
taken out of his side? Or if even one person of a human being out
of three can be called the image of God, as each person also is God
in the supreme Trinity itself, why is the woman also not the image
of God? For she is instructed for this very reason to cover her
head, which he is forbidden to do because he is the image of God.<note place="end" n="756" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 7, 5" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|11|7|0|0;|1Cor|11|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.7 Bible:1Cor.11.5">1 Cor. xi. 7, 5</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p4">10. But we must notice how that
which the apostle says, that not the woman but the man is the image
of God, is not contrary to that which is written in Genesis, &#8220;God
created man: in the image of God created He him; male and female
created He them: and He blessed them.&#8221; For this text says that
human nature itself, which is complete [only] in both sexes, was
made in the image of God; and it does not separate the woman from
the image of God which it signifies. For after <pb n="159" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_159.html" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-Page_159"/>saying that
God made man in the image of God, &#8220;He created him,&#8221; it says,
&#8220;male and female:&#8221; or at any rate, punctuating the words
otherwise, &#8220;male and female created He them.&#8221; How then did the
apostle tell us that the man is the image of God, and therefore he
is forbidden to cover his head; but that the woman is not so, and
therefore is commanded to cover hers? Unless, forsooth, according
to that which I have said already, when I was treating of the
nature of the human mind, that the woman together with her own
husband is the image of God, so that that whole substance may be
one image; but when she is referred separately to her quality of
<i>help-meet</i>, which regards the woman herself alone, then she
is not the image of God; but as regards the man alone, he is the
image of God as fully and completely as when the woman too is
joined with him in one. As we said of the nature of the human mind,
that both in the case when as a whole it contemplates the truth it
is the image of God; and in the case when anything is divided from
it, and diverted in order to the cognition of temporal things;
nevertheless on that side on which it beholds and consults truth,
here also it is the image of God, but on that side whereby it is
directed to the cognition of the lower things, it is not the image
of God. And since it is so much the more formed after the image of
God, the more it has extended itself to that which is eternal, and
is on that account not to be restrained, so as to withhold and
refrain itself from thence; therefore the man ought not to cover
his head. But because too great a progression towards inferior
things is dangerous to that rational cognition that is conversant
with things corporeal and temporal; this ought to have power on its
head, which the covering indicates, by which it is signified that
it ought to be restrained. For a holy and pious meaning is pleasing
to the holy angels.<note place="end" n="757" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 10" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p5.2" parsed="|1Cor|11|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.10">1 Cor. xi. 10</scripRef></p></note> For God sees not after the way of
time, neither does anything new take place in His vision and
knowledge, when anything is done in time and transitorily, after
the way in which such things affect the senses, whether the carnal
senses of animals and men, or even the heavenly senses of the
angels.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p6">11. For that the Apostle Paul, when
speaking outwardly of the sex of male and female, figured the
mystery of some more hidden truth, may be understood from this,
that when he says in another place that she is a widow indeed who
is desolate, without children and nephews, and yet that she ought
to trust in God, and to continue in prayers night and day,<note place="end" n="758" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p7"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 5" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p7.2" parsed="|1Tim|5|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.5">1 Tim. v. 5</scripRef></p></note> he here
indicates, that the woman having been brought into the
transgression by being deceived, is brought to salvation by
child-bearing; and then he has added, &#8220;If they continue in faith,
and charity, and holiness, with sobriety.&#8221;<note place="end" n="759" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p8"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. ii. 15" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p8.2" parsed="|1Tim|2|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.2.15">1 Tim. ii. 15</scripRef></p></note> As if it could possibly hurt a good
widow, if either she had not sons, or if those whom she had did not
choose to continue in good works. But because those things which
are called good works are, as it were, the sons of our life,
according to that sense of life in which it answers to the
question, What is a man&#8217;s life? that is, How does he act in these
temporal things? which life the Greeks do not call <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p8.3">&#958;&#969;&#8053;</span> but
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p8.4">&#946;&#8055;&#959;&#962;</span>; and
because these good works are chiefly performed in the way of
offices of mercy, while works of mercy are of no profit, either to
Pagans, or to Jews who do not believe in Christ, or to any heretics
or schismstics whatsoever in whom faith and charity and sober
holiness are not found: what the apostle meant to signify is plain,
and in so far figuratively and mystically, because he was speaking
of covering the head of the woman, which will remain mere empty
words, unless referred to some hidden sacrament.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p9">12. For, as not only most true
reason but also the authority of the apostle himself declares, man
was not made in the image of God according to the shape of his
body, but according to his rational mind. For the thought is a
debased and empty one, which holds God to be circumscribed and
limited by the lineaments of bodily members. But further, does not
the same blessed apostle say, &#8220;Be renewed in the spirit of your
mind, and put on the new man, which is created after God;&#8221;<note place="end" n="760" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p10"> <scripRef passage="Eph. iv. 23, 24" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p10.2" parsed="|Eph|4|23|4|24" osisRef="Bible:Eph.4.23-Eph.4.24">Eph. iv. 23, 24</scripRef></p></note> and in
another place more clearly, &#8220;Putting off the old man,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;with his deeds; put on the new man, which is renewed to the

are renewed in the spirit of our mind, and he is the new man who is
renewed to the knowledge of God after the image of Him that created
him; no one can doubt, that man was made after the image of Him
that created him, not according to the body, nor indiscriminately
according to any part of the mind, but according to the rational
mind, wherein the knowledge of God can exist. And it is according
to this renewal, also, that we are made sons of God by the baptism
of Christ; and putting on the new man, certainly put on Christ
through faith. Who is there, then, <pb n="160" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_160.html" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-Page_160"/>who will hold women to be alien
from this fellowship, whereas they are fellow-heirs of grace with
us; and whereas in another place the same apostle says, &#8220;For ye
are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus; for as many
as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ: there is
neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is
neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus?&#8221;<note place="end" n="762" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p11.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p12"> <scripRef passage="Gal. iii. 26-28" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p12.2" parsed="|Gal|3|26|3|28" osisRef="Bible:Gal.3.26-Gal.3.28">Gal. iii. 26&#8211;28</scripRef></p></note> Pray, have
faithful women then lost their bodily sex? But because they are
there renewed after the image of God, where there is no sex; man is
there made after the image of God, where there is no sex, that is,
in the spirit of his mind. Why, then, is the man on that account
not bound to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of
God, while the woman is bound to do so, because she is the glory of
the man; as though the woman were not renewed in the spirit of her
mind, which spirit is renewed to the knowledge of God after the
image of Him who created him? But because she differs from the man
in bodily sex, it was possible rightly to represent under her
bodily covering that part of the reason which is diverted to the
government of temporal things; so that the image of God may remain
on that side of the mind of man on which it cleaves to the
beholding or the consulting of the eternal reasons of things; and
this, it is clear, not men only, but also women have.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p2">17. Let us now complete, so far as
the Lord helps us, the discussion which we have undertaken,
respecting that part of reason to which knowledge belongs, that is,
the cognizance of things temporal and changeable, which is
necessary for managing the affairs of this life. For as in the case
of that visible wedlock of the two human beings who were made
first, the serpent did not eat of the forbidden tree, but only
persuaded them to eat of it; and the woman did not eat alone, but
gave to her husband, and they eat together; although she alone
spoke with the serpent, and she alone was led away by him:<note place="end" n="775" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 1-6" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|3|1|3|6" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.1-Gen.3.6">Gen. iii. 1&#8211;6</scripRef></p></note> so also in
the case of that hidden and secret kind of wedlock, which is
transacted and discerned in a single human being, the carnal, or as
I may say, since it is directed to the senses of the body, the
sensuous movement of the soul, which is common to us with beasts,
is shut off from the reason of wisdom. For certainly bodily things
are perceived by the sense of the body; but spiritual things, which
are eternal and unchangeable, are understood by the reason of
wisdom. But the reason of knowledge has appetite very near to it:
seeing that what is called the science or knowledge of actions
reasons concerning the bodily things which are perceived by the
bodily sense; if well, in order that it may refer that knowledge to
the end of the chief good; but if ill, in order that it may enjoy
them as being such good things as those wherein it reposes with a
false blessedness. Whenever, then, that carnal or animal sense
introduces into this purpose of the mind which is conversant about
things temporal and corporeal, <pb n="162" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_162.html" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-Page_162"/>with a view to the offices of a
man&#8217;s actions, by the living force of reason, some inducement to
enjoy itself, that is, to enjoy itself as if it were some private
good of its own, not as the public and common, which is the
unchangeable, good; then, as it were, the serpent discourses with
the woman. And to consent to this allurement, is to eat of the
forbidden tree. But if that consent is satisfied by the pleasure of
thought alone, but the members are so restrained by the authority
of higher counsel that they are not yielded as instruments of
unrighteousness unto sin;<note place="end" n="776" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Rom. vi. 13" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p4.2" parsed="|Rom|6|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.6.13">Rom. vi. 13</scripRef></p></note> this, I think, is to be considered
as if the woman alone should have eaten the forbidden food. But if,
in this consent to use wickedly the things which are perceived
through the senses of the body, any sin at all is so determined
upon, that if there is the power it is also fulfilled by the body;
then that woman must be understood to have given the unlawful food
to her husband with her, to be eaten together. For it is not
possible for the mind to determine that a sin is not only to be
thought of with pleasure, but also to be effectually committed,
unless also that intention of the mind yields, and serves the bad
action, with which rests the chief power of applying the members to
an outward act, or of restraining them from one.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p5">18. And yet, certainly, when the
mind is pleased in thought alone with unlawful things, while not
indeed determining that they are to be done, but yet holding and
pondering gladly things which ought to have been rejected the very
moment they touched the mind, it cannot be denied to be a sin, but
far less than if it were also determined to accomplished it in
outward act. And therefore pardon must be sought for such thoughts
too, and the breast must be smitten, and it must be said,
&#8220;Forgive us our debts;&#8221; and what follows must be done, and must
be joined in our prayer, &#8220;As we also forgive our debtors.&#8221;<note place="end" n="777" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p6"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 6.12" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p6.1" parsed="|Matt|6|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.12">Matt. vi. 12</scripRef></p></note> For it is
not as it was with those two first human beings, of which each one
bare his own person; and so, if the woman alone had eaten the
forbidden food, she certainly alone would have been smitten with
the punishment of death: it cannot, I say, be so said also in the
case of a single human being now, that if the thought, remaining
alone, be gladly fed with unlawful pleasures, from which it ought
to turn away directly, while yet there is no determination that the
bad actions are to be done, but only that they are retained with
pleasure in remembrance, the woman as it were can be condemned
without the man. Far be it from us to believe this. For here is one
person, one human being, and he as a whole will be condemned,
unless those things which, as lacking the will to do, and yet
having the will to please the mind with them, are perceived to be
sins of thought alone, are pardoned through the grace of the
Mediator.<note place="end" n="778" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p6.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p7"> [Augustin here teaches that the

distribution, by which the man is assumed to be the mind, but the
woman the bodily sense, all things seem aptly to agree together if
they are handled with due attention: unless that it is written,

about these and the like subjects seems to me to be the discourse
itself of wisdom. But to depart from evil, which Job says is
knowledge, is without doubt of temporal things. Since it is in
reference to time [and this world] that we are in evil, from which
we ought to abstain that we may come to those good eternal things.
And therefore, whatsoever we do prudently, boldly, temperately, and
justly, belongs to that knowledge or discipline wherewith our
action is conversant in avoiding evil and desiring good; and so
also, whatsoever we gather by the knowledge that comes from
inquiry, in the way of examples either to be guarded against or to
be imitated, and in the way of necessary proofs respecting any
subject, accommodated to our use.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-p10">23. When a discourse then relates
to these things, I hold it to be a discourse belonging to
knowledge, and to be distinguished from a discourse belonging to
wisdom, to which those things belong, which neither have
been, <pb n="164" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_164.html" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-Page_164"/>nor shall be, but are; and on account of that eternity
in which they are, are said to have been, and to be, and to be
about to be, without any changeableness of times. For neither have
they been in such way as that they should cease to be, nor are they
about to be in such way as if they were not now; but they have
always had and always will have that very absolute being. And they
abide, but not as if fixed in some place as are bodies; but as
intelligible things in incorporeal nature, they are so at hand to
the glance of the mind, as things visible or tangible in place are
to the sense of the body. And not only in the case of sensible
things posited in place, there abide also intelligible and
incorporeal reasons of them apart from local space; but also of
motions that pass by in successive times, apart from any transit in
time, there stand also like reasons, themselves certainly
intelligible, and not sensible. And to attain to these with the eye
of the mind is the lot of few; and when they are attained as much
as they can be, he himself who attains to them does not abide in
them, but is as it were repelled by the rebounding of the eye
itself of the mind, and so there comes to be a transitory thought
of a thing not transitory. And yet this transient thought is
committed to the memory through the instructions by which the mind
is taught; that the mind which is compelled to pass from thence,
may be able to return thither again; although, if the thought
should not return to the memory and find there what it had
committed to it, it would be led thereto like an uninstructed
person, as it had been led before, and would find it where it had
first found it, that is to say, in that incorporeal truth, whence
yet once more it may be as it were written down and fixed in the
mind. For the thought of man, for example, does not so abide in
that incorporeal and unchangeable reason of a square body, as that
reason itself abides: if, to be sure, it could attain to it at all
without the phantasy of local space. Or if one were to apprehend
the rhythm of any artificial or musical sound, passing through
certain intervals of time, as it rested without time in some secret
and deep silence, it could at least be thought as long as that song
could be heard; yet what the glance of the mind, transient though
it was, caught from thence, and, absorbing as it were into a belly,
so laid up in the memory, over this it will be able to rumiuate in
some measure by recollection, and to transfer what it has thus
learned into systematic knowledge. But if this has been blotted out
by absolute forgetfulness, yet once again, under the guidance of
teaching, one will come to that which had altogether dropped away,
and it will be found such as it was.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.xv-p2">24. And hence that noble
philosopher Plato endeavored to persuade us that the souls of men
lived even before they bare these bodies; and that hence those
things which are learnt are rather remembered, as having been known
already, than taken into knowledge as things new. For he has told
us that a boy, when questioned I know not what respecting geometry,
replied as if he were perfectly skilled in that branch of learning.
For being questioned step by step and skillfully, he saw what was
to be seen, and said that which he saw.<note place="end" n="791" id="iv.i.xiv.xv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.xv-p3"> [This fine specimen of the
&#8220;obstetric method&#8221; of Socrates is given in Plato&#8217;s dialogue,
Meno.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> But if this had been a recollecting
of things previously known, then certainly every one, or almost
every one, would not have been able so to answer when questioned.
For not every one was a geometrician in the former life, since
geometricians are so few among men that scarcely one can be found
anywhere. But we ought rather to believe, that the intellectual
mind is so formed in its nature as to see those things, which by
the disposition of the Creator are subjoined to things intelligible
in a natural order, by a sort of incorporeal light of an unique
kind; as the eye of the flesh sees things adjacent to itself in
this bodily light, of which light it is made to be receptive, and
adapted to it. For none the more does this fleshly eye, too,
distinguish black things from white without a teacher, because it
had already known them before it was created in this flesh. Why,
lastly, is it possible only in intelligible things that any one
properly questioned should answer according to any branch of
learning, although ignorant of it? Why can no one do this with
things sensible, except those which he has seen in this his present
body, or has believed the information of others who knew them,
whether somebody&#8217;s writings or words? For we must not acquiesce
in their story, who assert that the Samian Pythagoras recollected
some things of this kind, which he had experienced when he was
previously here in another body; and others tell yet of others,
that they experienced something of the same <pb n="165" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_165.html" id="iv.i.xiv.xv-Page_165"/>sort in
their minds: but it may be conjectured that these were untrue
recollections, such as we commonly experience in sleep, when we
fancy we remember, as though we had done or seen it, what we never
did or saw at all; and that the minds of these persons, even though
awake, were affected in this way at the suggestion of malignant and
deceitful spirits, whose care it is to confirm or to sow some false
belief concerning the changes of souls, in order to deceive men.
This, I say, may be conjectured from this, that if they really
remembered those things which they had seen here before, while
occupying other bodies, the same thing would happen to many, nay to
almost all; since they suppose that as the dead from the living,
so, without cessation and continually, the living are coming into
existence from the dead; as sleepers from those that are awake, and
those that are awake from them that sleep.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.xv-p4">25. If therefore this is the right
distinction between wisdom and knowledge, that the intellectual
cognizance of eternal things belongs to wisdom, but the rational
cognizance of temporal things to knowledge, it is not difficult to
judge which is to be preferred or postponed to which. But if we
must employ some other distinction by which to know these two
apart, which without doubt the apostle teaches us are different,
saying, &#8220;To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to
another the word of knowledge, by the same Spirit:&#8221; still the
difference between those two which we have laid down is a most
evident one, in that the intellectual cognizance of eternal things
is one thing, the rational cognizance of temporal things another;
and no one doubts but that the former is to be preferred to the
latter. As then we leave behind those things which belong to the
outer man, and desire to ascend within from those things which we
have in common with beasts, before we come to the cognizance of
things intelligible and supreme, which are eternal, the rational
cognizance of temporal things presents itself. Let us then find a
trinity in this also, if we can, as we found one in the senses of
the body, and in those things which through them entered in the way
of images into our soul or spirit; so that instead of corporeal
things which we touch by corporeal sense, placed as they are
without us, we might have resemblances of bodies impressed within
on the memory from which thought might be formed, while the will as
a third united them; just as the sight of the eyes was formed from
without, which the will applied to the visible thing in order to
produce vision, and united both, while itself also added itself
thereto as a third. But this subject must not be compressed into
this book; so that in that which follows, if God help, it may be
suitably examined, and the conclusions to which we come may be
unfolded.</p>

<p class="c38" id="iv.i.xv-p3">The inquiry is prosecuted
respecting knowledge, in which, as distinguished from wisdom,
Augustin had begun in the former book to look for a kind of
trinity. And occasion is taken of commending Christian faith, and
of explaining how the faith of believers is one and common. Next,
that all desire blessedness, yet that all have not the faith
whereby we arrive at blessedness; and that this faith is defined in
Christ, who in the flesh rose from the dead; and that no one is set
free from the dominion of the devil through forgiveness of sins,
save through Him. It is shown also at length that it was needful
that the devil should be conquered by Christ, not by power, but by
righteousness. Finally, that when the words of this faith are
committed to memory, there is in the mind a kind of trinity, since
there are, first, in the memory the sounds of the words, and this
even when the man is not thinking of them; and next, the mind&#8217;s
eye of his recollection is formed thereupon when he thinks of them;
and, lastly, the will, when he so thinks and remembers, combines
both.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.i-p2">1. <span class="c19" id="iv.i.xv.i-p2.1">In</span> the
book before this, <i>viz</i>. the twelfth of this work, we have
done enough to distinguish the office of the rational mind in
temporal things, wherein not only our knowing but our action is
concerned, from the more excellent office of the same mind, which
is employed in contemplating eternal things, and is limited to
knowing alone. But I think it more convenient that I should insert
somewhat out of the Holy Scriptures, by which the two may more
easily be distinguished.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.i-p3">2. John the Evangelist has thus
begun his Gospel: &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning
with God. All things were made by Him; and without Him was not
anything made that was made. In Him was life; and the life was the
light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness
comprehended it not. There was a man sent from God, whose name was
John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light,
that all men through Him might believe. He was not that Light, but
was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the true Light,
which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the
world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not.
He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. But as many as
received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even
to them that believe on His name: which were born, not of blood,
nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld His
glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father), full of
grace and truth.&#8221;<note place="end" n="792" id="iv.i.xv.i-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.i-p4"> <scripRef passage="John i. 1-14" id="iv.i.xv.i-p4.2" parsed="|John|1|1|1|14" osisRef="Bible:John.1.1-John.1.14">John i. 1&#8211;14</scripRef></p></note> This entire passage, which I
have <pb n="167" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_167.html" id="iv.i.xv.i-Page_167"/>here taken from the Gospel, contains in its earlier
portions what is immutable and eternal, the contemplation of which
makes us blessed; but in those which follow, eternal things are
mentioned in conjunction with temporal things. And hence some
things there belong to knowledge, some to wisdom, according to our
previous distinction in the twelfth book. For the words,&#8212;&#8220;In
the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were
made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made.
In Him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light
shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it
not:&#8221;&#8212;require a contemplative life, and must be discerned by
the intellectual mind; and the more any one has profited in this,
the wiser without doubt will he become. But on account of the
verse, &#8220;The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness
comprehended it not,&#8221; faith certainly was necessary, whereby that
which was not seen might be believed. For by &#8220;darkness&#8221; he
intended to signify the hearts of mortals turned away from light of
this kind, and hardly able to behold it; for which reason he
subjoins, &#8220;There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all
men through Him might believe.&#8221; But here we come to a thing that
was done in time, and belongs to knowledge, which is comprised in
the cognizance of facts. And we think of the man John under that
phantasy which is impressed on our memory from the notion of human
nature. And whether men believe or not, they think this in the same
manner. For both alike know what man is, the outer part of whom,
that is, his body, they have learned through the eyes of the body;
but of the inner, that is, the soul, they possess the knowledge in
themselves, because they also themselves are men, and through
intercourse with men; so that they are able to think what is said,
&#8220;There was a man, whose name was John,&#8221; because they know the
names also by interchange of speech. But that which is there also,
<i>viz</i>. &#8220;sent from God,&#8221; they who hold at all, hold by
faith; and they who do not hold it by faith, either hesitate
through doubt, or deride it through unbelief. Yet both, if they are
not in the number of those over-foolish ones, who say in their
heart &#8220;There is no God,&#8221;<note place="end" n="793" id="iv.i.xv.i-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.i-p5"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xiv. 1" id="iv.i.xv.i-p5.2" parsed="|Ps|14|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.14.1">Ps. xiv. 1</scripRef></p></note> when they hear these words, think
both things, <i>viz</i>. both what God is, and what it is to be
sent from God; and if they do not do this as the things themselves
really are, they do it at any rate as they can.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.i-p6">3. Further, we know from other
sources the faith itself which a man sees to be in his own heart,
if he believes, or not to be there, if he does not believe: but not
as we know bodies, which we see with the bodily eyes, and think of
even when absent through the images of themselves which we retain
in memory; nor yet as those things which we have not seen, and
which we frame howsoever we can in thought from those which we have
seen, and commit them to memory, that we may recur to them when we
will, in order that therein we may similarly by recollection
discern them, or rather discern the images of them, of what sort
soever these are which we have fixed there; nor again as a living
man, whose soul we do not indeed see, but conjecture from our own,
and from corporeal motions gaze also in thought upon the living
man, as we have learnt him by sight. Faith is not so seen in the
heart in which it is, by him whose it is; but most certain
knowledge holds it fast, and conscience proclaims it. Although
therefore we are bidden to believe on this account, because we
cannot see what we are bidden to believe; nevertheless we see faith
itself in ourselves, when that faith is in us; because faith even
in absent things is present, and faith in things which are without
us is within, and faith in things which are not seen is itself
seen, and itself none the less comes into the hearts of men in
time; and if any cease to be faithful and become unbelievers, then
it perishes from them. And sometimes faith is accommodated even to
falsehoods; for we sometimes so speak as to say, I put faith in
him, and he deceived me. And this kind of faith, if indeed it too
is to be called faith, perishes from the heart without blame, when
truth is found and expels it. But faith in things that are true,
passes, as one should wish it to pass, into the things themselves.
For we must not say that faith perishes, when those things which
were believed are seen. For is it indeed still to be called faith,
when faith, according to the definition in the Epistle to the
Hebrews, is the evidence of things not seen?<note place="end" n="794" id="iv.i.xv.i-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.i-p7"> <scripRef passage="Heb. xi. 1" id="iv.i.xv.i-p7.2" parsed="|Heb|11|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.11.1">Heb. xi. 1</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.i-p8">4. In the words which follow next,
&#8220;The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that
all men through him might believe;&#8221; the action, as we have said,
is one done in time. For to bear witness even to that which is
eternal, as is that light that is intelligible, is a thing done in
time. And <pb n="168" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_168.html" id="iv.i.xv.i-Page_168"/>of this it was that John came to bear witness who &#8220;was
not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.&#8221; For
he adds &#8220;That was the true Light that lighteth every man that
cometh into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made
by Him, and the world knew Him not. He came unto His own, and His
own received Him not.&#8221; Now they who know the Latin language,
understand all these words, from those things which they know: and
of these, some have become known to us through the senses of the
body, as man, as the world itself, of which the greatness is so
evident to our sight; as again the sounds of the words themselves,
for hearing also is a sense of the body; and some through the
reason of the mind, as that which is said, &#8220;And His own received
Him not;&#8221; for this means, that they did not believe in Him; and
what belief is, we do not know by any sense of the body, but by the
reason of the mind. We have learned, too, not the sounds, but the
meanings of the words themselves, partly through the sense of the
body, partly through the reason of the mind. Nor have we now heard
those words for the first time, but they are words we had heard
before. And we were retaining in our memory as things known, and we
here recognized, not only the words themselves, but also what they
meant. For when the bisyllabic word <i>mundus</i> is uttered, then
something that is certainly corporeal, for it is a sound, has
become known through the body, that is, through the ear. But that
which it means also, has become known through the body, that is,
through the eyes of the flesh. For so far as the world is known to
us at all, it is known through sight. But the quadri-syllabic word
<i>crediderunt</i> reaches us, so far as its sound, since that is a
corporeal thing, through the ear of the flesh; but its meaning is
discoverable by no sense of the body, but by the reason of the
mind. For unless we knew through the mind what the word <i>
crediderunt</i> meant, we should not understand what they did not
do, of whom it is said, &#8220;And His own received Him not.&#8221; The
sound then of the word rings upon the ears of the body from
without, and reaches the sense which is called hearing. The species
also of man is both known to us in ourselves, and is presented to
the senses of the body from without, in other men; to the eyes,
when it is seen; to the ears, when it is heard; to the touch, when
it is held and touched; and it has, too, its image in our memory,
incorporeal indeed, but like the body. Lastly, the wonderful beauty
of the world itself is at hand from without, both to our gaze, and
to that sense which is called touch, if we come in contact with any
of it: and this also has its image within in our memory, to which
we revert, when we think of it either in the enclosure of a room,
or again in darkness. But we have already sufficiently spoken in
the eleventh book of these images of corporeal things; incorporeal
indeed, yet having the likeness of bodies, and belonging to the
life of the outer man. But we are treating now of the inner man,
and of his knowledge, namely, that knowledge which is of things
temporal and changeable; into the purpose and scope of which, when
anything is assumed, even of things belonging to the outer man, it
must be assumed for this end, that something may thence be taught
which may help rational knowledge. And hence the rational use of
those things which we have in common with irrational animals
belongs to the inner man; neither can it rightly be said that this
is common to us with the irrational animals.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.ii-p2">5. But faith, of which we are
compelled, by reason of the arrangement of our subject, to dispute
somewhat more at length in this book: faith I say, which they who
have are called the faithful, and they who have not, unbelievers,
as were those who did not receive the Son of God coming to His own;
although it is wrought in us by hearing, yet does not belong to
that sense of the body which is called hearing, since it is not a
sound; nor to the eyes of this our flesh, since it is neither color
nor bodily form; nor to that which is called touch, since it has
nothing of bulk; nor to any sense of the body at all, since it is a
thing of the heart, not of the body; nor is it without apart from
us, but deeply seated within us; nor does any man see it in
another, but each one in himself. Lastly, it is a thing that can
both be feigned by pretence, and be thought to be in him in whom it
is not. Therefore every one sees his own faith in himself; but does
not see, but believes, that it is in another; and believes this the
more firmly, the more he knows the fruits of it, which faith is
wont to work by love.<note place="end" n="795" id="iv.i.xv.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.ii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gal. v. 6" id="iv.i.xv.ii-p3.2" parsed="|Gal|5|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.5.6">Gal. v. 6</scripRef></p></note> And therefore this faith is common
to all of whom the evangelist subjoins, &#8220;But as many as received

of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God;&#8221;
common I say, not as any form of a bodily object is common, as
regards sight, to the eyes of all to whom it is present, for in
some way the gaze of all that behold it is informed by the same one
form; but as the human countenance can be said to be common to all
men; for this is so said that yet each certainly has his own. We
say certainly with perfect truth, that the faith of believers is
impressed from one doctrine upon the heart of each several person
who believes the same thing. But that which is believed is a
different thing from the faith by which it is believed. For the
former is in things which are said either to be, or to have been or
to be about to be; but the latter is in the mind of the believer,
and is visible to him only whose it is; although not indeed itself
but a faith like it, is also in others. For it is not one in
number, but in kind; yet on account of the likeness, and the
absence of all difference, we rather call it one than many. For
when, too, we see two men exceedingly alike, we wonder, and say
that both have one countenance. It is therefore more easily said

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xv.iii-p1.1">Chapter
3.&#8212;Some Desires Being the Same in All, are Known to Each. The
Poet Ennius.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.iii-p2">6. There is, indeed, so closely
conspiring a harmony in the same nature living and using reason,
that although one knows not what the other wills, yet there are
some wills of all which are also known to each; and although each
man does not know what any other one man wills, yet in some things
he may know what all will. And hence comes that story of the comic
actor&#8217;s witty joke, who promised that he would say in the
theatre, in some other play, what all had in their minds, and what
all willed; and when a still greater crowd had come together on the
day appointed, with great expectation, all being in suspense and
silent, is affirmed to have said: You will to buy cheap, and sell
dear. And mean actor though he was, yet all in his words recognized
what themselves were conscious of, and applauded him with wonderful
goodwill, for saying before the eyes of all what was confessedly
true, yet what no one looked for. And why was so great expectation
raised by his promising that he would say what was the will of all,
unless because no man knows the wills of other men? But did not he
know that will? Is there any one who does not know it? Yet why,
unless because there are some things which not unfitly each
conjectures from himself to be in others, through sympathy or
agreement either in vice or virtue? But it is one thing to see
one&#8217;s own will; another to conjecture, however certainly, what is
another&#8217;s. For, in human affairs, I am as certain that Rome was
built as that Constantinople was, although I have seen Rome with my
eyes, but know nothing of the other city, except what I have
believed on the testimony of others. And truly that comic actor
believed it to be common to all to will to buy cheap and sell dear,
either by observing himself or by making experiment also of others.
But since such a will is in truth a fault, every one can attain the
counter virtue, or run into the mischief of some other fault which
is contrary to it, whereby to resist and conquer it. For I myself
know a case where a manuscript was offered to a man for purchase,
who perceived that the vendor was ignorant of its value, and was
therefore asking something very small, and who thereupon gave him,
though not expecting it, the just price, which was much more.
Suppose even the case of a man possessed with wickedness so great
as to sell cheap what his parents left to him, and to buy dear, in
order to waste it on his own lusts? Such wanton extravagance, I
fancy, is not incredible; and if such men are sought, they may be
found, or even fall in one&#8217;s way although not sought; who, by a
wickedness more than that of the theatre, make a mock of the
theatrical proposition or declaration, by buying dishonor at a
great price, while selling lands at a small one. We have heard,
too, of persons that, for the sake of distribution, have bought
corn at a higher <pb n="170" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_170.html" id="iv.i.xv.iii-Page_170"/>price, and sold it to their
fellow-citizens at a lower one. And note also what the old poet
Ennius has said: that &#8220;all mortals wish themselves to be
praised;&#8221; wherein, doubtless, he conjectured what was in others,
both by himself, and by those whom he knew by experience; and so
seems to have declared what it is that all men will. Lastly, if
that comic actor himself, too, had said, You all will to be
praised, no one of you wills to be abused; he would have seemed in
like manner to have expressed what all will. Yet there are some who
hate their own faults, and do not desire to be praised by others
for that for which they are displeased with themselves; and who
thank the kindness of those who rebuke them, when the purpose of
that rebuke is their own amendment. But if he had said, You all
will to be blessed, you do not will to be wretched; he would have
said something which there is no one that would not recognize in
his own will. For whatever else a man may will secretly, he does
not withdraw from that will, which is well known to all men, and
well known to be in all men.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.iv-p2">7. It is wonderful, however, since
the will to obtain and retain blessedness is one in all, whence
comes, on the other hand, such a variety and diversity of wills
concerning that blessedness itself; not that any one is unwilling
to have it, but that all do not know it. For if all knew it, it
would not be thought by some to be in goodness of mind; by others,
in pleasure of body; by others, in both; and by some in one thing,
by others in another. For as men find special delight in this thing
or that, so have they placed in it their idea of a blessed life.
How, then, do all love so warmly what not all know? Who can love
what he does not know?&#8212;a subject which I have already discussed
in the preceding books.<note place="end" n="800" id="iv.i.xv.iv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.iv-p3"> Bks. viii. c. 4, etc., x. c.
1.</p></note> Why, therefore, is blessedness
loved by all, when it is not known by all? Is it perhaps that all
know what it is itself, but all do not know where it is to be
found, and that the dispute arises from this?&#8212;as if, forsooth,
the business was about some place in this world, where every one
ought to will to live who wills to live blessedly; and as if the
question where blessedness is were not implied in the question what
it is. For certainly, if it is in the pleasure of the body, he is
blessed who enjoys the pleasure of the body; if in goodness of
mind, he has it who enjoys this; if in both, he who enjoys both.
When, therefore, one says, to live blessedly is to enjoy the
pleasure of the body; but another, to live blessedly is to enjoy
goodness of mind; is it not, that either both know, or both do not
know, what a blessed life is? How, then, do both love it, if no one
can love what he does not know? Or is that perhaps false which we
have assumed to be most true and most certain, <i>viz</i>. that all
men will to live blessedly? For if to live blessedly is, for
argument&#8217;s sake, to live according to goodness of mind, how does
he will to live blessedly who does not will this? Should we not say
more truly, That man does not will to live blessedly, because he
does not wish to live according to goodness, which alone is to live
blessedly? Therefore all men do not will to live blessedly; on the
contrary, few wish it; if to live blessedly is nothing else but to
live according to goodness of mind, which many do not will to do.
Shall we, then, hold that to be false of which the Academic Cicero
himself did not doubt (although Academics doubt every thing), who,
when he wanted in the dialogue <i>Hortensius</i> to find some
certain thing, of which no one doubted, from which to start his
argument, says, We certainly all will to be blessed? Far be it from
me to say this is false. But what then? Are we to say that,
although there is no other way of living blessedly than living
according to goodness of mind, yet even he who does not will this,
wills to live blessedly? This, indeed, seems too absurd. For it is
much as if we should say, Even he who does not will to live
blessedly, wills to live blessedly. Who could listen to, who could
endure, such a contradiction? And yet necessity thrusts us into
this strait, if it is both true that all will to live blessedly,
and yet all do not will to live in that way in which alone one can
live blessedly.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.v-p2">8. Or is, perhaps, the deliverance
from our difficulties to be found in this, that, since we have said
that every one places his idea of a blessed life in that which has
most pleased him, as pleasure pleased Epicurus, and goodness Zeno,
and something else pleased other people, we say that to live
blessedly is nothing else but to live according to one&#8217;s own
pleasure: so that it is not false that all will to live blessedly,
because all will that which pleases each? For if this, too, had
been proclaimed to the people in the theatre, all would have found
it in their own wills. But <pb n="171" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_171.html" id="iv.i.xv.v-Page_171"/>when Cicero, too, had
propounded this in opposition to himself, he so refuted it as to
make them blush who thought so. For he says: &#8220;But, behold! people
who are not indeed philosophers, but who yet are prompt to dispute,
say that all are blessed, whoever live as they will;&#8221; which is
what we mean by, as pleases each. But by and by he has subjoined:
&#8220;But this is indeed false. For to will what is not fitting, is
itself most miserable; neither is it so miserable not to obtain
what one wills, as to will to obtain what one ought not.&#8221; Most
excellently and altogether most truly does he speak. For who can be
so blind in his mind, so alienated from all light of decency, and
wrapped up in the darkness of indecency, as to call him blessed,
because he lives as he will, who lives wickedly and disgracefully;
and with no one restraining him, no one punishing, and no one
daring even to blame him, nay more, too, with most people praising
him, since, as divine Scripture says, &#8220;The wicked is praised in
his heart&#8217;s desire: and he who works iniquity is blessed,&#8221;<note place="end" n="801" id="iv.i.xv.v-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.v-p3"> <scripRef passage="Ps. x. 3" id="iv.i.xv.v-p3.2" parsed="|Ps|10|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.10.3">Ps. x. 3</scripRef></p></note> gratifies
all his most criminal and flagitious desires; when, doubtless,
although even so he would be wretched, yet he would be less
wretched, if he could have had nothing of those things which he had
wrongly willed? For every one is made wretched by a wicked will
also, even though it stop short with will but more wretched by the
power by which the longing of a wicked will is fulfilled. And,
therefore, since it is true that all men will to be blessed, and
that they seek for this one thing with the most ardent love, and on
account of this seek everything which they do seek; nor can any one
love that of which he does not know at all what or of what sort it
is, nor can be ignorant what that is which he knows that he wills;
it follows that all know a blessed life. But all that are blessed
have what they will, although not all who have what they will are
forewith blessed. But they are forewith wretched, who either have
not what they will, or have that which they do not rightly will.
Therefore he only is a blessed man, who both has all things which
he wills, and wills nothing ill.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.vi-p2">9. Since, then, a blessed life
consists of these two things, and is known to all, and dear to all;
what can we think to be the cause why, when they cannot have both,
men choose, out of these two, to have all things that they will,
rather than to will all things well, even although they do not have
them? Is it the depravity itself of the human race, in such wise
that, while they are not unaware that neither is he blessed who has
not what he wills, nor he who has what he wills wrongly, but he who
both has whatsoever good things he wills, and wills no evil ones,
yet, when both are not granted of those two things in which the
blessed life consists, that is rather chosen by which one is
withdrawn the more from a blessed life (since he certainly is
further from it who obtains things which he wickedly desired, than
he who only does not obtain the things which he desired); whereas
the good will ought rather to be chosen, and to be preferred, even
if it do not obtain the things which it seeks? For he comes near to
being a blessed man, who wills well whatsoever he wills, and wills
things, which when he obtains, he will be blessed. And certainly
not bad things, but good, make men blessed, when they do so make
them. And of good things he already has something, and that, too, a
something not to be lightly esteemed,&#8212;namely, the very good will
itself; who longs to rejoice in those good things of which human
nature is capable, and not in the performance or the attainment of
any evil; and who follows diligently, and attains as much as he
can, with a prudent, temperate, courageous, and right mind, such
good things as are possible in the present miserable life; so as to
be good even in evils, and when all evils have been put an end to,
and all good things fulfilled, then to be blessed.</p>

nor will he will anything that will be wanting, nor will there be
wanting anything which he shall have willed. Whatever shall be
loved, will be present; nor will that be longed for, which shall
not be present. Everything which will be there will be good, and
the supreme God will be the supreme good and will be present for
those to enjoy who love Him; and what altogether is most blessed,
it will be certain that it will be so forever. But now, indeed,
philosophers have made for themselves, according to the pleasure of
each, their own ideals of a blessed life; that they might be able,
as it were by their own power, to do that, which by the common
conditions of mortals they were not able to do,&#8212;namely, to live
as they would. For they felt that no one could be blessed otherwise
than by having what he would, and by suffering nothing which he
would not. And who would not will, that the life whatsoever it be,
with which he is delighted, and which he therefore calls blessed,
were so in his own power, that he could have it continually? And
yet who is in this condition? Who wills to suffer troubles in order
that he may endure them manfully, although he both wills and is
able to endure them if he does suffer them? Who would will to live
in torments, even although he is able to live laudably by holding
fast to righteousness in the midst of them through patience? They
who have endured these evils, either in wishing to have or in
fearing to lose what they loved, whether wickedly or laudably, have
thought of them as transitory. For many have stretched boldly
through transitory evils to good things which will last. And these,
doubtless, are blessed through hope, even while actually suffering
such transitory evils, through which they arrive at good things
which will not be transitory. But he who is blessed through hope is
not yet blessed: for he expects, through patience, a blessedness
which he does not yet grasp. Whereas he, on the other hand, who is
tormented without any such hope, without any such reward, let him
use as much endurance as he pleases, is not truly blessed, but
bravely miserable. For he is not on that account not miserable,
because he would be more so if he also bore misery impatiently.
Further, even if he does not suffer those things which he would not
will to suffer in his own body, not even then is he to be esteemed
blessed, inasmuch as he does not live as he wills. For to omit
other things, which, while the body remains unhurt, belong to those
annoyances of the mind, without which we should will to live, and
which are innumerable; he would will, at any rate, if he were able,
so to have his body safe and sound, and so to suffer no
inconveniences from it, as to have it within his own control, or
even to have it with an imperishableness of the body itself; and
because he does not possess this, and hangs in doubt about it, he
certainly does not live as he wills. For although he may be ready
from fortitude to accept, and bear with an equal mind, whatever
adversities may happen to him, yet he had rather they should not
happen, and prevents them if he is able; and he is in such way
ready for both alternatives, that, as much as is in him, he wishes
for the one and shuns the other; and if he have fallen into that
which he shuns, he therefore bears it willingly, because that could
not happen which he willed. He bears it, therefore, in order that
he may not be crushed; but he would not willingly be even burdened.
How, then, does he live as he wills? Is it because he is willingly
strong to bear what he would not will to be put upon him? Then he
only wills what he can, because he cannot have what he wills. And
here is the sum-total of the blessedness of proud mortals, I know
not whether to be laughed at, or not rather to be pitied, who boast
that they live as they will, because they willingly bear patiently
what they are unwilling should happen to them. For this, they say,
is like Terence&#8217;s wise saying,&#8212;</p>

be blessed, certainly, if they will truly, they will also to be
immortal; for otherwise they could not be blessed. And further, if
questioned also concerning immortality, as before concerning
blessedness, all reply that they will 
<pb n="173" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_173.html" id="iv.i.xv.viii-Page_173"/>it. But blessedness of
what quality soever, such as is not so, but rather is so called, is
sought, nay indeed is feigned in this life, whilst immortality is
despaired of, without which true blessedness cannot be. Since he
lives blessedly, as we have already said before, and have
sufficiently proved and concluded, who lives as he wills, and wills
nothing wrongly. But no one wrongly wills immortality, if human
nature is by God&#8217;s gift capable of it; and if it is not capable
of it, it is not capable of blessedness. For, that a man may live
blessedly, he must needs live. And if life quits him by his dying,
how can a blessed life remain with him? And when it quits him,
without doubt it either quits him unwilling, or willing, or
neither. If unwilling, how is the life blessed which is so within
his will as not to be within his power? And whereas no one is
blessed who wills something that he does not have, how much less is
he blessed who is quitted against his will, not by honor, nor by
possessions, nor by any other thing, but by the blessed life
itself, since he will have no life at all? And hence, although no
feeling is left for his life to be thereby miserable (for the
blessed life quits him, because life altogether quits him), yet he
is wretched as long as he feels, because he knows that against his
will that is being destroyed for the sake of which he loves all
else, and which he loves beyond all else. A life therefore cannot
both be blessed, and yet quit a man against his will, since no one
becomes blessed against his will; and hence how much more does it
make a man miserable by quitting him against his will, when it
would make him miserable if he had it against his will! But if it
quit him with his will, even so how was that a blessed life, which
he who had it willed should perish? It remains then for them to
say, that neither of these is in the mind of the blessed man; that
is, that he is neither unwilling nor willing to be quitted by a
blessed life, when through death life quits him altogether; for
that he stands firm with an even heart, prepared alike for either
alternative. But neither is that a blessed life which is such as to
be unworthy of his love whom it makes blessed. For how is that a
blessed life which the blessed man does not love? Or how is that
loved, of which it is received indifferently, whether it is to
flourish or to perish? Unless perhaps the virtues, which we love in
this way on account of blessedness alone, venture to persuade us
that we do not love blessedness itself. Yet if they did this, we
should certainly leave off loving the virtues themselves, when we
do not love that on account of which alone we loved them. And
further, how will that opinion be true, which has been so tried,
and sifted, and thoroughly strained, and is so certain, <i>viz.</i>
that all men will to be blessed, if they themselves who are already
blessed neither will nor do not will to be blessed? Or if they will
it, as truth proclaims, as nature constrains, in which indeed the
supremely good and unchangeably blessed Creator has implanted that
will: if, I say, they will to be blessed who are blessed, certainly
they do not will to be not blessed. But if they do not will not to
be blessed, without doubt they do not will to be annihilated and
perish in regard to their blessedness. But they cannot be blessed
except they are alive; therefore they do not will so to perish in
regard to their life. Therefore, whoever are either truly blessed
or desire to be so, will to be immortal. But he does not live
blessedly who has not that which he wills. Therefore it follows
that in no way can life be truly blessed unless it be
eternal.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.ix-p2">12. Whether human nature can
receive this, which yet it confesses to be desirable, is no small
question. But if faith be present, which is in those to whom Jesus
has given power to become the sons of God, then there is no
question. Assuredly, of those who endeavor to discover it from
human reasonings, scarcely a few, and they endued with great
abilities, and abounding in leisure, and learned with the most
subtle learning, have been able to attain to the investigation of
the immortality of the soul alone. And even for the soul they have
not found a blessed life that is stable, that is, true; since they
have said that it returns to the miseries of this life even after
blessedness. And they among them who are ashamed of this opinion,
and have thought that the purified soul is to be placed in eternal
happiness without a body, hold such opinions concerning the past
eternity of the world, as to confute this opinion of theirs
concerning the soul; a thing which here it is too long to
demonstrate; but it has been, as I think, sufficiently explained by
us in the twelfth book of the <i>City of God</i>.<note place="end" n="804" id="iv.i.xv.ix-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.ix-p3"> C. 20.</p></note> But that faith promises, not by
human reasoning, but by divine authority, that the whole man, who
certainly consists of soul <pb n="174" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_174.html" id="iv.i.xv.ix-Page_174"/>and body, shall be immortal,
and on this account truly blessed. And so, when it had been said in
the Gospel, that Jesus has given &#8220;power to become the sons of God
to them who received Him;&#8221; and what it is to have received Him
had been shortly explained by saying, &#8220;To them that believe on
His name;&#8221; and it was further added in what way they are to
become sons of God, <i>viz</i>., &#8220;Which were born not of blood,
nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
God;&#8221;&#8212;lest that infirmity of men which we all see and bear

men,&#8212;how much more credible is it that the sons of men by nature
should be made the sons of God by the grace of God, and should
dwell in God, in whom alone and from whom alone the blessed can be
made partakers of that immortality; of which that we might be
convinced, the Son of God was made partaker of our

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.x-p2">13. Those then who say, What, had
God no other way by which He might free men from the misery of this
mortality, that He should will the only-begotten Son, God
co-eternal with Himself, to become man, by putting on a human soul
and flesh, and being made mortal to endure death?&#8212;these, I say,
it is not enough so to refute, as to assert that that mode by which
God deigns to free us through the Mediator of God and men, the man
Christ Jesus, is good and suitable to the dignity of God; but we
must show also, not indeed that no other mode was possible to God,
to whose power all things are equally subject, but that there
neither was nor need have been any other mode more appropriate for
curing our misery. For what was so necessary for the building up of
our hope, and for the freeing the minds of mortals cast down by the
condition of mortality itself, from despair of immortality, than
that it should be demonstrated to us at how great a price God rated
us, and how greatly He loved us? But what is more manifest and
evident in this so great proof hereof, than that the Son of God,
unchangeably good, remaining what He was in Himself, and receiving
from us and for us what He was not, apart from any loss of His own
nature, and deigning to enter into the fellowship of ours, should
first, without any evil desert of His own, bear our evils; and so
with unobligated munificence should bestow His own gifts upon us,
who now believe how much God loves us, and who now hope that of
which we used to despair, without any good deserts of our own, nay,
with our evil deserts too going before?</p>

constitute our deserts, by which we arrive at the chief good of an
immortal blessedness. &#8220;But God,&#8221; says the apostle,
&#8220;commendeth His love towards as, in that, while we were yet
sinners, Christ died for us. Much more, then, being now justified
by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.&#8221; To this
he goes on to add, &#8220;For if, when we were enemies, we were
reconciled to God by the death of His Son; much more, being
reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.&#8221; Those whom he first
calls sinners he afterwards calls the enemies of God; and those
whom he first speaks of as justified by His blood, he afterwards
speaks of as reconciled by the death of the Son of God; and those
whom he speaks of first as saved from wrath through Him, he
afterwards speaks of as saved by His life. We were not, therefore,
before that grace merely anyhow sinners, but in such sins that we
were enemies of God. But the same apostle calls us above several
times by two appellations, <i>viz</i>. sinners and enemies of
God,&#8212;one as if the most mild, the other plainly the most
harsh,&#8212;saying, &#8220;For if when we were yet weak, in due time
Christ died for the ungodly.&#8221;<note place="end" n="810" id="iv.i.xv.x-p7.4"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.x-p8"> <scripRef passage="Rom. v. 6-10" id="iv.i.xv.x-p8.2" parsed="|Rom|5|6|5|10" osisRef="Bible:Rom.5.6-Rom.5.10">Rom. v. 6&#8211;10</scripRef></p></note> Those whom he called weak, the same

could have seeing that it could have it when it wanted it. And this
foregoing sentence of the apostle, where he says, &#8220;For when we
were yet weak, in due time He died for the ungodly,&#8221; coheres with
those two following sentences; in the one of which he spoke of
sinners, in the other of enemies of God, as though he referred each
severally to each, <i>viz.</i> sinners to the weak, the enemies of
God to the ungodly.</p>

beseech you, that they who believe should be justified in it? And
what is meant by &#8220;being reconciled by the death of His Son?&#8221;
Was it indeed so, that when God the Father was wroth with us, He
saw the death of His Son for us, and was appeased towards us? Was
then His Son already so far appeased towards us, that He even
deigned to die for us; while the Father was still so far wroth,
that except His Son died for us, He would not be appeased? And
what, then, is that which the same teacher of the Gentiles himself
says in another place: &#8220;What shall we then say to these things?
If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not His own
Son, but delivered Him up for us all; how has He not with Him also
freely given us all things?&#8221;<note place="end" n="811" id="iv.i.xv.xi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xi-p3"> <scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 31, 32" id="iv.i.xv.xi-p3.2" parsed="|Rom|8|31|8|32" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.31-Rom.8.32">Rom. viii. 31, 32</scripRef></p></note> Pray, unless the Father had been
already appeased, would He have delivered up His own Son, not

contrary to that? In the one, the Son dies for us, and the Father
is reconciled to us by His death; in the other, as though the
Father first loved us, He Himself on our account does not spare the
Son, He Himself for us delivers Him up to death. But I see that the
Father loved us also before, not only before the Son died for us,
but before He created the world; the apostle himself being witness,
who says, &#8220;According as He hath chosen us in Him before the

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p2">16. By the justice of God in some
sense, the human race was delivered into the power of the devil;
the sin of the first man passing over originally into all of both
sexes in their birth through conjugal union, and the debt of our
first parents binding their whole posterity. This delivering up is
first signified in Genesis, where, when it had been said to the
serpent, &#8220;Dust shalt thou eat,&#8221; it was said to the man, &#8220;Dust
thou art, and unto dust thou shall return.&#8221;<note place="end" n="814" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 14-19" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|3|14|3|19" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.14-Gen.3.19">Gen. iii. 14&#8211;19</scripRef></p></note> In the words, &#8220;Unto dust shalt
thou return,&#8221; the death of the body is fore-announced, because he
would not have experienced that either, if he had continued to the
end upright as he was made; but in that it is said to him whilst
still living, &#8220;Dust thou art,&#8221; it is shown that the whole man
was changed for the worse. For &#8220;Dust thou art&#8221; is much the same
as, &#8220;My spirit shall not always remain in these men, for that
they also are flesh.&#8221;<note place="end" n="815" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Gen. vi. 3" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p4.2" parsed="|Gen|6|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.6.3">Gen. vi. 3</scripRef>. &#8220;Strive
with man,&#8221; A.V.</p></note> Therefore it was at that time
shown, that he was delivered to him, in that it had been said to
him, &#8220;Dust shall thou eat.&#8221; But the apostle declares this more
clearly, where he says: &#8220;And you who were dead in trespasses and
sins, wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of
this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the
spirit that now worketh in the children of unfaithfulness; among
whom we also had our conversation in times past, in the lusts of
our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and
were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.&#8221;<note place="end" n="816" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p5"> <scripRef passage="Eph. ii. 1-3" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p5.2" parsed="|Eph|2|1|2|3" osisRef="Bible:Eph.2.1-Eph.2.3">Eph. ii. 1&#8211;3</scripRef></p></note> The
&#8220;children of unfaithfulness&#8221; are the unbelievers; and who is
not this before he becomes a believer? And therefore all men are
originally under the prince of the power of the air, &#8220;who worketh
in the children of unfaithfulness.&#8221; And that which I have
expressed by &#8220;originally&#8221; is the same that the apostle
expresses when he speaks of themselves who &#8220;by nature&#8221; were as
others; <i>viz</i>. by nature as it has been depraved by sin, not
as it was created upright from the beginning. But the way in which
man was thus delivered into the power of the devil, ought not to be
so understood as if God did this, or commanded it to be done; but
that He only permitted it, yet that justly. For when He abandoned
the sin<pb n="176" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_176.html" id="iv.i.xv.xii-Page_176"/>ner, the author of the sin immediately entered. Yet God
did not certainly so abandon His own creature as not to show
Himself to him as God creating and quickening, and among penal
evils bestowing also many good things upon the evil. For He hath
not in anger shut up His tender mercies.<note place="end" n="817" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p6"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lxxvii. 9" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p6.2" parsed="|Ps|77|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.77.9">Ps. lxxvii. 9</scripRef></p></note> Nor did He dismiss man from the law
of His own power, when He permitted him to be in the power of the
devil; since even the devil himself is not separated from the power
of the Omnipotent, as neither from His goodness. For whence do even
the evil angels subsist in whatever manner of life they have,
except through Him who quickens all things? If, therefore, the
commission of sins through the just anger of God subjected man to
the devil, doubtless the remission of sins through the merciful
reconciliation of God rescues man from the devil.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.xiii-p2">17. But the devil was to be
overcome, not by the power of God, but by His righteousness. For
what is more powerful than the Omnipotent? Or what creature is
there of which the power can be compared to the power of the
Creator? But since the devil, by the fault of his own perversity,
was made a lover of power, and a forsaker and assailant of
righteousness,&#8212;for thus also men imitate him so much the more in
proportion as they set their hearts on power, to the neglect or
even hatred of righteousness, and as they either rejoice in the
attainment of power, or are inflamed by the lust of it,&#8212;it
pleased God, that in order to the rescuing of man from the grasp of
the devil, the devil should be conquered, not by power, but by
righteousness; and that so also men, imitating Christ, should seek
to conquer the devil by righteousness, not by power. Not that power
is to be shunned as though it were something evil; but the order
must be preserved, whereby righteousness is before it. For how
great can be the power of mortals? Therefore let mortals cleave to
righteousness; power will be given to immortals. And compared to
this, the power, how great soever, of those men who are called
powerful on earth, is found to be ridiculous weakness, and a
pitfall is dug there for the sinner, where the wicked seem to be
most powerful. And the righteous man says in his song, &#8220;Blessed
is the man whom Thou chasteneth, O Lord, and teachest him out of
Thy law: that Thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,
until the pit be digged for the wicked. For the Lord will not cast
off His people, neither will He forsake His inheritance, until
righteousness return unto judgment, and all who follow it are
upright in heart.&#8221;<note place="end" n="818" id="iv.i.xv.xiii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xiii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xciv. 12-15" id="iv.i.xv.xiii-p3.2" parsed="|Ps|94|12|94|15" osisRef="Bible:Ps.94.12-Ps.94.15">Ps. xciv. 12&#8211;15</scripRef></p></note> At this present time, then, in

in its humility and weakness; &#8220;until the righteousness,&#8221; which
the weakness of the pious now possesses, &#8220;shall return to
judgment,&#8221; that is, shall receive the power of judging; which is
preserved in the end for the righteous when power in its due order
shall have followed after righteousness going before. For power
joined to righteousness, or righteousness added to power,
constitutes a judicial authority. But righteousness belongs to a
good will; whence it was said by the angels when Christ was born:
&#8220;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good
will.&#8221;<note place="end" n="819" id="iv.i.xv.xiii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xiii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Luke ii. 14" id="iv.i.xv.xiii-p4.2" parsed="|Luke|2|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.2.14">Luke ii. 14</scripRef></p></note> But power
ought to follow righteousness, not to go before it; and accordingly

two things make a man blessed, as we have argued above, to will
well, and to be able to do what one wills, people ought not to be
so perverse, as has been noted in the same discussion, as that a
man should choose from the two things which make him blessed, the
being able to do what he wills, and should neglect to will what he
ought; whereas he ought first to have a good will, but great power
afterwards. Further, a good will must be purged from vices, by
which if a man is overcome, he is in such wise overcome as that he
wills evil; and then how will his will be still good? It is to be
wished, then, that power may now be given, but power against vices,
to conquer which men do not wish to be powerful, while they wish to
be so in order to conquer men; and why is this, unless that, being
in truth conquered, they feignedly conquer, and are conquerors not
in truth, but in opinion? Let a man will to be prudent, will to be
strong, will to be temperate, will to be just; and that he may be
able to have these things truly, let him certainly desire power,
and seek to be powerful in himself, and (strange though it be)
against himself for himself. But all the other things which he
wills rightly, and yet is not able to have, as, for instance,
immortality and true and full felicity, let him not cease to long
for, and let him patiently expect.</p>

righteousness by which the devil was conquered? What, except the
righteousness of Jesus Christ? And how was he conquered? Because,
when he found in Him nothing worthy of death, yet he slew Him. And
certainly it is just, that we whom he held as debtors, should be

passion, that He might pay for us debtors that which He Himself did
not owe. Would then the devil be conquered by this most just right,
if Christ had willed to deal with him by power, not by
righteousness? But He held back what was possible to Him, in order
that He might first do what was fitting. And hence it was necessary
that He should be both man and God. For unless He had been man, He
could not have been slain; unless He had been God, men would not
have believed that He would not do what He could, but that He could
not do what He would; nor should we have thought that righteousness
was preferred by Him to power, but that He lacked power. But now He
suffered for us things belonging to man, because He was man; but if
He had been unwilling, it would have been in His power to not so to
suffer, because He was also God. And righteousness was therefore
made more acceptable in humility, because so great power as was in
His Divinity, if He had been unwilling, would have been able not to
suffer humility; and thus by Him who died, being thus powerful,
both righteousness was commended, and power promised, to us, weak
mortals. For He did one of these two things by dying, the other by
rising again. For what is more righteous, than to come even to the
death of the cross for righteousness? And what more powerful, than
to rise from the dead, and to ascend into heaven with that very
flesh in which He was slain? And therefore He conquered the devil
first by righteousness, and afterwards by power: namely, by
righteousness, because He had no sin, and was slain by him most
unjustly; but by power, because having been dead He lived again,
never afterwards to die.<note place="end" n="825" id="iv.i.xv.xiv-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xiv-p7"> <scripRef passage="Rom. vi. 9" id="iv.i.xv.xiv-p7.2" parsed="|Rom|6|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.6.9">Rom. vi. 9</scripRef></p></note> But He would have conquered the
devil by power, even though He could not have been slain by him:
although it belongs to a greater power to conquer death itself also
by rising again, than to avoid it by living. But the reason is
really a different one, why we are justified in the blood of
Christ, when we are rescued from the power of the devil through the
remission of sins: it pertains to this, that the devil is conquered
by Christ by righteousness, not by power. For Christ was crucified,
not through immortal power, but through the weakness which He took
upon Him in mortal flesh; of which weakness nevertheless the
apostle says, &#8220;that the weakness of God is stronger than
men.&#8221;<note place="end" n="826" id="iv.i.xv.xiv-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xiv-p8"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 25" id="iv.i.xv.xiv-p8.2" parsed="|1Cor|1|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.25">1 Cor. i. 25</scripRef></p></note></p>

that the devil was conquered, when he who was slain by Him rose
again. It is something more, and more profound of comprehension, to
see that the devil was conquered when he thought himself to have
conquered, that is, when Christ was slain. For then that blood,
since it was His who had no sin at all, was poured out for the
remission of our sins; that, because the devil deservedly held
those whom, as guilty of sin, he bound by the condition of death,
he might deservedly loose them through Him, whom, as guilty of no
sin, the punishment of death undeservedly affected. The strong man

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p2">20. For although the death, too, of
the flesh itself came originally from the sin of the first man, yet
the good use of it has made most glorious martyrs. And so not only
that death itself, but all the evils of this world, and the griefs
and labors of men, although they come from the deserts of sins, and
especially of original sin, whence life itself too became bound by
the bond of death, yet have fitly remained, even when sin is
forgiven; that man might have wherewith to contend for truth, and
whereby the goodness of the faithful might be exercised; in order
that the new man through the new covenant might be made ready among
the evils of this world for a new world, by bearing wisely the
misery which this condemned life deserved, and by rejoicing soberly
because it will be finished, but expecting faithfully and patiently
the blessedness which the future life, being set free, will have
for ever. For the devil being cast forth from his dominion, and
from the hearts of the faithful, in the condemnation and
faithlessness of whom he, although himself also condemned, yet
reigned, is only so far permitted to be an adversary according to
the condition of this mortality, as God knows to be expedient for
them: concerning which the sacred writings speak through the mouth
of the apostle: &#8220;God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be
tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also
make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.&#8221;<note place="end" n="834" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 13" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|10|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.13">1 Cor. x. 13</scripRef></p></note> And those
evils which the faithful endure piously, are of profit either for
the correction of sins, or for the exercising and proving of
righteousness, or to manifest the misery of this life, that the
life where will be that true and perpetual blessedness may be
desired more ardently, and sought out more earnestly. But it is on
their account that these evils are still kept in being, of whom the
apostle says: &#8220;For we know that all things work together for good
to them that love God, to them who are called to be holy according
to His purpose. For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate
to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the
first-born among many brethren. Moreover, whom He did predestinate,
them He also called; and whom He called, them He also justified;
and whom He justified, them He also glorified.&#8221; It is of these
who are predestinated, that not one shall perish with the devil;
not one shall remain even to death under the power of the devil.
And then follows what I have already cited above:<note place="end" n="835" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p4"> C. 2.</p></note> &#8220;What shall we then say to these
things? If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not
His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all; how has He not with
Him also freely given us all things?&#8221;<note place="end" n="836" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p5"> <scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 28-32" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p5.2" parsed="|Rom|8|28|8|32" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.28-Rom.8.32">Rom. viii. 28&#8211;32</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p6">21. Why then should the death of
Christ not have come to pass? Nay, rather, why should not that
death itself have been chosen above all else to be brought to pass,
to the passing by of the other innumerable ways which He who is
omnipotent could have employed to free us; that death, I say,
wherein neither was anything diminished or changed from His
divinity, and so great benefit was conferred upon men, from the
humanity which He took upon Him, that a temporal death, which was
not due, was rendered by the eternal Son of God, who was also the
Son of man, whereby He might free them from an eternal <pb n="179" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_179.html" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-Page_179"/>death which
was due? The devil was holding fast our sins, and through them was
fixing us deservedly in death. He discharged them, who had none of
His own, and who was led by him to death undeservedly. That blood
was of such price, that he who even slew Christ for a time by a
death which was not due, can as his due detain no one, who has put
on Christ, in the eternal death which was due. Therefore &#8220;God
commendeth His love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners,
Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified in His
blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.&#8221; Justified, he
says, in His blood,&#8212;justified plainly, in that we are freed from
all sin; and freed from all sin, because the Son of God, who knew
no sin, was slain for us. Therefore &#8220;we shall be saved from wrath
through Him;&#8221; from the wrath certainly of God, which is nothing
else but just retribution. For the wrath of God is not, as is that
of man, a perturbation of the mind; but it is the wrath of Him to
whom Holy Scripture says in another place, &#8220;But Thou, O Lord,
mastering Thy power, judgest with calmness.&#8221;<note place="end" n="837" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p7"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. xii. 18" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p7.2" parsed="|Wis|12|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.12.18">Wisd. xii. 18</scripRef></p></note> If, therefore, the just retribution
of God has received such a name, what can be the right
understanding also of the reconciliation of God, unless that then
such wrath comes to an end? Neither were we enemies to God, except
as sins are enemies to righteousness; which being forgiven, such
enmities come to an end, and they whom He Himself justifies are
reconciled to the Just One. And yet certainly He loved them even
while still enemies, since &#8220;He spared not His own Son, but
delivered Him up for us all,&#8221; when we were still enemies. And
therefore the apostle has rightly added: &#8220;For if, when we were
enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son,&#8221; by
which that remission of sins was made, &#8220;much more, being
reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.&#8221; Saved in life, who
were reconciled by death. For who can doubt that He will give His
life for His friends, for whom, when enemies, He gave His death?
&#8220;And not only so,&#8221; he says, &#8220;but we also joy in God, through
our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the
atonement.&#8221; &#8220;Not only,&#8221; he says, &#8220;shall we be saved,&#8221; but
&#8220;we also joy;&#8221; and not in ourselves, but &#8220;in God;&#8221; nor
through ourselves, &#8220;but through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we
have now received the atonement,&#8221; as we have argued above. Then
the apostle adds, &#8220;Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the
world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, in whom
all have sinned;&#8221;<note place="end" n="838" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p8"> <scripRef passage="Rom. v. 8, 12" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p8.2" parsed="|Rom|5|8|0|0;|Rom|5|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.5.8 Bible:Rom.5.12">Rom. v. 8, 12</scripRef></p></note> etc.: in which he disputes at some

are freed from the debts both of our first father and of ourselves.
Further, since on account of that one the devil held all who were
begotten through his corrupted carnal concupiscence, it is just
that on account of this one he should loose all who are regenerated
through His immaculate spiritual grace.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.xvii-p2">22. There are many other things
also in the incarnation of Christ, displeasing as it is to the
proud, that are to be observed and thought of advantageously. And
one of them is, that it has been demonstrated to man what place he
has in the things which God has created; since human nature could
so be joined to God, that one person could be made of two
substances, and thereby indeed of three&#8212;God, soul, and flesh: so
that those proud malignant spirits, who interpose themselves as
mediators to deceive, although as if to help, do not therefore dare
to place themselves above man because they have not flesh; and
chiefly because the Son of God deigned to die also in the same
flesh, lest they, because they seem to be immortal, should
therefore succeed in getting themselves worshipped as gods.
Further, that the grace of God might be commended to us in the man
Christ without any precedent merits; because not even He Himself
obtained by any precedent merits that He should be joined in such
great unity with the true God, and should become the Son of God,
one Person with Him; but from the time when He began to be man,
from that time He is also God; whence it is said, &#8220;The Word was
made flesh.&#8221;<note place="end" n="839" id="iv.i.xv.xvii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xvii-p3"> <scripRef passage="John i. 14" id="iv.i.xv.xvii-p3.2" parsed="|John|1|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.14">John i. 14</scripRef></p></note> Then, again,
there is this, that the pride of man, which is the chief hindrance
against his cleaving to God, can be confuted and healed through
such great humility of God. Man learns also how far he has gone
away from God; and what it is worth to him as a pain to cure him,
when he returns through such a Mediator, who both as God assists
men by His divinity, and as man agrees with men by His weakness.
For what greater example of obedience could be given to us, who had
perished through disobedience, <pb n="180" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_180.html" id="iv.i.xv.xvii-Page_180"/>than God the Son obedient to

obedience itself be better shown, than in the flesh of so great a
Mediator, which rose again to eternal life? It belonged also to the
justice and goodness of the Creator, that the devil should be
conquered by the same rational creature which he rejoiced to have
conquered, and by one that came from that same race which, by the
corruption of its origin through one, he held
altogether.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.xviii-p2">23. For assuredly God could have
taken upon Himself to be man, that in that manhood He might be the
Mediator between God and men, from some other source, and not from
the race of that Adam who bound the human race by his sin; as He
did not create him whom He first created, of the race of some one
else. Therefore He was able, either so, or in any other mode that
He would, to create yet one other, by whom the conqueror of the
first might be conquered. But God judged it better both to take
upon Him man through whom to conquer the enemy of the human race,
from the race itself that had been conquered; and yet to do this of
a virgin, whose conception, not flesh but spirit, not lust but
faith, preceded.<note place="end" n="841" id="iv.i.xv.xviii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xviii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Luke i. 26-32" id="iv.i.xv.xviii-p3.2" parsed="|Luke|1|26|1|32" osisRef="Bible:Luke.1.26-Luke.1.32">Luke i. 26&#8211;32</scripRef></p></note> Nor did that
concupiscence of the flesh intervene, by which the rest of men, who
derive original sin, are propagated and conceived; but holy
virginity became pregnant, not by conjugal intercourse, but by
faith,&#8212;lust being utterly absent,&#8212;so that that which was born
from the root of the first man might derive only the origin of
race, not also of guilt. For there was born, not a nature corrupted
by the contagion of transgression, but the one only remedy of all
such corruptions. There was born, I say, a Man having nothing at
all, and to have nothing at all, of sin; through whom they were to
be born again so as to be freed from sin, who could not be born
without sin. For although conjugal chastity makes a right use of
the carnal concupiscence which is in our members; yet it is liable
to motions not voluntary, by which it shows either that it could
not have existed at all in paradise before sin, or if it did, that
it was not then such as that sometimes it should resist the will.
But now we feel it to be such, that in opposition to the law of the
mind, and even if there is no question of begetting, it works in us
the incitement of sexual intercourse; and if in this men yield to
it, then it is satisfied by an act of sin; if they do not, then it
is bridled by an act of refusal: which two things who could doubt
to have been alien from paradise before sin? For neither did the
chastity that then was do anything indecorous, nor did the pleasure
that then was suffer anything unquiet. It was necessary, therefore,
that this carnal concupiscence should be entirely absent, when the
offspring of the Virgin was conceived; in whom the author of death
was to find nothing worthy of death, and yet was to slay Him in
order that he might be conquered by the death of the Author of
life: the conqueror of the first Adam, who held fast the human
race, conquered by the second Adam, and losing the Christian race,
freed out of the human race from human guilt, through Him who was

might be conquered by that race which he had conquered by guilt.

govern that Man, but bare Him [as a Son]. These so great gifts of

Word made flesh did and bare for us in time and place, belong,
according to the distinction which we have undertaken to
demonstrate, to knowledge, not to wisdom. And as the Word is
without time and without place, it is co-eternal with the Father,
and in its wholeness everywhere; and if any one can, and as much as
he can, speak truly concerning this Word, then his discourse will
pertain to wisdom. And hence the Word made flesh, which is Christ
Jesus, has the treasures both of wisdom and of knowledge. For the
apostle, writing to the Colossians, says: &#8220;For I would that ye
knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea,
and for as many as have not seen my face in the <pb n="181" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_181.html" id="iv.i.xv.xix-Page_181"/>flesh; that
their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and
unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the
acknowledgment of the mystery of God which is Christ Jesus: in whom
are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.&#8221;<note place="end" n="843" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p3"> <scripRef passage="Col. ii. 1-3" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p3.2" parsed="|Col|2|1|2|3" osisRef="Bible:Col.2.1-Col.2.3">Col. ii. 1&#8211;3</scripRef></p></note> To what

&#8220;But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to

are in such way to be distinguished from each other, that wisdom is
to be assigned to divine things, knowledge to human, I acknowledge

read, &#8220;The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,&#8221; I
understand by the Word the true Son of God, I acknowledge in the
flesh the true Son of man, and both together joined into one Person
of God and man, by an ineffable copiousness of grace. And on
account of this, the apostle goes on to say, &#8220;And we beheld His
glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father, full of
grace and truth.&#8221;<note place="end" n="845" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p5"> <scripRef passage="John i. 14" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p5.2" parsed="|John|1|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.14">John i. 14</scripRef></p></note> If we refer grace to knowledge, and
truth to wisdom, I think we shall not swerve from that distinction
between these two things which we have commended. For in those
things that have their origin in time, this is the highest grace,
that man is joined with God in unity of person; but in things
eternal the highest truth is rightly attributed to the Word of God.
But that the same is Himself the Only-begotten of the Father, full
of grace and truth,&#8212;this took place, in order that He Himself in
things done for us in time should be the same for whom we are
cleansed by the same faith, that we may contemplate Him steadfastly
in things eternal. And those distinguished philosophers of the
heathen who have been able to understand and discern the invisible
things of God by those things which are made, have yet, as is said
of them, &#8220;held down the truth in iniquity;&#8221;<note place="end" n="846" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p6"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 23" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p6.2" parsed="|Rom|1|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.23">Rom. i. 23</scripRef>; <i>

a Mediator, that is, without the man Christ, whom they neither
believed to be about to come at the word of the prophets, nor to
have come at that of the apostles. For, placed as they were in
these lowest things, they could not but seek some media through
which they might attain to those lofty things which they had
understood; and so they fell upon deceitful spirits, through whom
it came to pass, that &#8220;they changed the glory of the
incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and
to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.&#8221;<note place="end" n="847" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p7"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 18, 20" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p7.2" parsed="|Rom|1|18|0|0;|Rom|1|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.18 Bible:Rom.1.20">Rom. i. 18, 20</scripRef></p></note> For in such
forms also they set up or worshipped idols. Therefore Christ is our
knowledge, and the same Christ is also our wisdom. He Himself
implants in us faith concerning temporal things, He Himself shows
forth the truth concerning eternal things. Through Him we reach on
to Himself: we stretch through knowledge to wisdom; yet we do not
withdraw from one and the same Christ, &#8220;in whom are hidden all
the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge.&#8221; But now we speak of
knowledge, and will hereafter speak of wisdom as much as He Himself
shall grant. And let us not so take these two things, as if it were
not allowable to speak either of the wisdom which is in human
things, or of the knowledge which is in divine. For after a laxer
custom of speech, both can be called wisdom, and both knowledge.
Yet the apostle could not in any way have written, &#8220;To one is
given the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge,&#8221;
except also these several things had been properly called by the
several names, of the distinction between which we are now
treating.</p>

We Have Reached by Steps to a Certain Trinity, Which is Found in
Practical Knowledge and True Faith.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p2">25. Now, therefore, let us see what
this prolix discourse has effected, what it has gathered, whereto
it has reached. It belongs to all men to will to be blessed; yet
all men have not faith, whereby the heart is cleansed, and so
blessedness is reached. And thus it comes to pass, that by means of
the faith which not all men will, we have to reach on to the
blessedness which every one wills. All see in their own heart that
they will to be blessed; and so great is the agreement of human
nature on this subject, that the man is not deceived who
conjectures this concerning another&#8217;s mind, out of his own: in
short, we know ourselves that all will this. But many despair of
being immortal, although no otherwise can any one be that which all
will, that is, blessed. Yet they will also to be immortal if they
could; but through not believing that they can, they do not so live
that they can. Therefore faith is necessary, that we may attain
blessedness in all the good things of human nature, that is, of
both soul <pb n="182" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_182.html" id="iv.i.xv.xx-Page_182"/>and body. But that same faith requires that this faith
be limited in Christ, who rose in the flesh from the dead, not to
die any more; and that no one is freed from the dominion of the
devil, through the forgiveness of sins, save by Him; and that in
the abiding place of the devil, life must needs be at once
miserable and never-ending, which ought rather to be called death
than life. All which I have also argued, so far as space permitted,
in this book, while I have already said much on the subject in the
fourth book of this work as well;<note place="end" n="848" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p3"> Cc. 19&#8211;21.</p></note> but in that place for one purpose,
here for another,&#8212;namely, there, that I might show why and how
Christ was sent in the fullness of time by the Father,<note place="end" n="849" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p4"> <scripRef passage="Gal. iv. 4" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p4.2" parsed="|Gal|4|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.4.4">Gal. iv. 4</scripRef></p></note> on account
of those who say that He who sent and He who was sent cannot be
equal in nature; but here, in order to distinguish practical
knowlege from contemplative wisdom.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p5">26. For we wished to ascend, as it
were, by steps, and to seek in the inner man, both in knowledge and
in wisdom, a sort of trinity of its own special kind, such as we
sought before in the outer man; in order that we may come, with a
mind more practised in these lower things, to the contemplation of
that Trinity which is God, according to our little measure, if
indeed, we can even do this, at least in a riddle and as through a
glass.<note place="end" n="850" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p6"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiii. 12" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p6.2" parsed="|1Cor|13|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.12">1 Cor. xiii. 12</scripRef></p></note> If, then,
any one have committed to memory the words of this faith in their
sounds alone, not knowing what they mean, as they commonly who do
not know Greek hold in memory Greek words, or similarly Latin ones,
or those of any other language of which they are ignorant, has not
he a sort of trinity in his mind? because, first, those sounds of
words are in his memory, even when he does not think thereupon; and
next, the mental vision (<i>acies</i>) of his act of recollection
is formed thence when he conceives of them; and next, the will of
him who remembers and thinks unites both. Yet we should by no means
say that the man in so doing busies himself with a trinity of the
interior man, but rather of the exterior; because he remembers, and
when he wills, contemplates as much as he wills, that alone which
belongs to the sense of the body, which is called hearing. Nor in
such an act of thought does he do anything else than deal with
images of corporeal things, that is, of sounds. But if he holds and
recollects what those words signify, now indeed something of the
inner man is brought into action; not yet, however, ought he to be
said or thought to live according to a trinity of the inner man, if
he does not love those things which are there declared, enjoined,
promised. For it is possible for him also to hold and conceive
these things, supposing them to be false, in order that he may
endeavor to disprove them. Therefore that will, which in this case
unites those things which are held in the memory with those things
which are thence impressed on the mind&#8217;s eye in conception,
completes, indeed, some kind of trinity, since itself is a third
added to two others; but the man does not live according to this,
when those things which are conceived are taken to be false, and
are not accepted. But when those things are believed to be true,
and those things which therein ought to be loved, are loved, then
at last the man does live according to a trinity of the inner man;
for every one lives according to that which he loves. But how can
things be loved which are not known, but only believed? This
question has been already treated of in former books;<note place="end" n="851" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p7"> Bk. viii. cc. 8 seqq., and Bk. x.
c. 1, etc.</p></note> and we
found, that no one loves what he is wholly ignorant of, but that
when things not known are said to be loved, they are loved from
those things which are known. And now we so conclude this book,
that we admonish the just to live by faith,<note place="end" n="852" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p8"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 17" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p8.2" parsed="|Rom|1|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.17">Rom. i. 17</scripRef></p></note> which faith worketh by love,<note place="end" n="853" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p9"> <scripRef passage="Gal. v. 6" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p9.2" parsed="|Gal|5|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.5.6">Gal. v. 6</scripRef></p></note> so that the
virtues also themselves, by which one lives prudently, boldly,
temperately, and justly, be all referred to the same faith; for not
otherwise can they be true virtues. And yet these in this life are
not of so great worth, as that the remission of sins, of some kind
or other, is not sometimes necessary here; and this remission comes
not to pass, except through Him, who by His own blood conquered the
prince of sinners. Whatsoever ideas are in the mind of the faithful
man from this faith, and from such a life, when they are contained
in the memory, and are looked at by recollection, and please the
will, set forth a kind of trinity of its own sort.<note place="end" n="854" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p9.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p10"> [The ternary is this: 1. The idea
of a truth or fact held in the memory. 2. The contemplation of it
as thus recollected. 3. The love of it. This last is the &#8220;will&#8221;
that &#8220;unites&#8221; the first two.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> But the
image of God, of which by His help we shall afterwards speak, is
not yet in that trinity; a thing which will then be more apparent,
when it shall have been shown where it is, which the reader may
expect in a succeeding book.</p>

belongs to wise men, what shall we do? Shall we dare indeed to
profess wisdom, lest it should be mere impudence for ourselves to
dispute about it? Shall we not be alarmed by the example of
Pythagoras?&#8212;who dared not profess to be a wise man, but answered
that he was a philosopher, <i>i.e.</i>, a lover of wisdom; whence
arose the name, that became thenceforth so much the popular name,
that no matter how great the learning wherein any one excelled,
either in his own opinion or that of others, in things pertaining
to wisdom, he was still called nothing more than philosopher. Or
was it for this reason that no one, even of <pb n="184" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_184.html" id="iv.i.xvi.i-Page_184"/>such as
these, dared to profess himself a wise man,&#8212;because they imagined
that a wise man was one without sin? But our Scriptures do not say

the philosopher, <i>i.e</i>., the lover of wisdom. For they have

wisdom, they have defined it thus: Wisdom is the knowledge of
things human and divine. And hence, in the last book, I have not

definition is to be divided, so that the knowledge of things divine
shall be called wisdom, and that of things human appropriate to
itself the name of knowledge; and of the latter I have treated in
the thirteenth book, not indeed so as to attribute to this
knowledge everything whatever that can be known by man about things
human, wherein there is exceeding much of empty vanity and
mischievous curiosity, but only those things by which that most
wholesome faith, which leads to true blessedness, is begotten,
nourished, defended, strengthened; and in this knowledge most of
the faithful are not strong, however exceeding strong in the faith
itself. For it is one thing to know only what man ought to believe
in order to attain to a blessed life, which must needs be an
eternal one; but another to know in what way this belief itself may
both help the pious, and be defended against the impious, which
last the apostle seems to call by the special name of knowledge.
And when I was speaking of this knowledge before, my especial
business was to commend faith, first briefly distinguishing things
eternal from things temporal, and there discoursing of things
temporal; but while deferring things eternal to the present book, I
showed also that faith respecting things eternal is itself a thing
temporal, and dwells in time in the hearts of believers, and yet is
necessary in order to attain the things eternal themselves.<note place="end" n="868" id="iv.i.xvi.i-p17.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.i-p18"> Bk. xiii. c. 7.</p></note> I argued
also, that faith respecting the things temporal which He that is
eternal did and suffered for us as man, which manhood He bare in
time and carried on to things eternal, is profitable also for the
obtaining of things eternal; and that the virtues themselves,
whereby in this temporal and mortal life men live prudently,
bravely, temperately, and justly, are not true virtues, unless they
are referred to that same faith, temporal though it is, which leads
on nevertheless to things eternal.</p>

that should seem to be constituted in things temporal which ought
to be so in things eternal. For when the human mind sees its own
faith, whereby it believes what it does not see, it does not see a
thing eternal. For that will not always exist, which certainly will
not then exist, when this pilgrimage, whereby we are absent from
God, in such way that we must needs walk by faith, shall be ended,

because we believe although we do not see, we shall deserve to see,
and shall rejoice at having been brought through faith to sight.
For then it will be no longer faith, by which that is believed
which is not seen; but sight, by which that is seen which is
believed. And then, therefore, although we remember this past
mortal life, and call to mind by recollection that we once believed
what we did not see, yet that faith will be reckoned among things
past and done with, not among things present and always continuing.
And hence also that trinity which now consists in the remembering,
contemplating, and loving this same faith while present and
continuing, will then be found to be done with and past, and not
still enduring. And hence it is to be gathered, that if that
trinity is indeed an im<pb n="185" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_185.html" id="iv.i.xvi.ii-Page_185"/>age of God, then this image
itself would have to be reckoned, not among things that exist

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.iii-p2">But far be it from us to think,
that while the nature of the soul is immortal, and from the first
beginning of its creation thenceforth never ceases to be, yet that
that which is the best thing it has should not endure for ever with
its own immortality. Yet what is there in its nature as created,
better than that it is made after the image of its Creator?<note place="end" n="872" id="iv.i.xvi.iii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.iii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. i. 27" id="iv.i.xvi.iii-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|1|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.27">Gen. i. 27</scripRef></p></note> We must find
then what may be fittingly called the image of God, not in the
holding, contemplating, and loving that faith which will not exist
always, but in that which will exist always.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.iii-p4">5. Shall we then scrutinize
somewhat more carefully and deeply whether the case is really thus?
For it may be said that this trinity does not perish even when
faith itself shall have passed away; because, as now we both hold
it by memory, and discern it by thought, and love it by will; so
then also, when we shall both hold in memory, and shall recollect,
that we once had it, and shall unite these two by the third, namely
will, the same trinity will still continue. Since, if it have left
in its passage as it were no trace in us, doubtless we shall not
have ought of it even in our memory, whereto to recur when
recollecting it as past, and by the third, <i>viz</i>. purpose,
coupling both these, to wit, what was in our memory though we were
not thinking about it, and what is formed thence by conception. But
he who speaks thus, does not perceive, that when we hold, see, and
love in ourselves our present faith, we are concerned with a
different trinity as now existing, from that trinity which will
exist, when we shall contemplate by recollection, not the faith
itself, but as it were the imagined trace of it laid up in the
memory, and shall unite by the will, as by a third, these two
things, <i>viz</i>. that which was in the memory of him who
retains, and that which is impressed thence upon the vision of the
mind of him who recollects. And that we may understand this, let us
take an example from things corporeal, of which we have
sufficiently spoken in the eleventh book.<note place="end" n="873" id="iv.i.xvi.iii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.iii-p5"> Cc. 2 sq.</p></note> For as we ascend from lower to
higher things, or pass inward from outer to inner things, we first
find a trinity in the bodily object which is seen, and in the
vision of the seer, which, when he sees it, is informed thereby,
and in the purpose of the will which combines both. Let us assume a
trinity like this, when the faith which is now in ourselves is so
established in our memory as the bodily object we spoke of was in
place, from which faith is formed the conception in recollection,
as from that bodily object was formed the vision of the beholder;
and to these two, to complete the trinity, will is to be reckoned
as a third, which connects and combines the faith established in
the memory, and a sort of effigy of that faith impressed upon the
vision of recollection; just as in that trinity of corporeal
vision, the form of the bodily object that is seen, and the
corresponding form wrought in the vision of the beholder, are
combined by the purpose of the will. Suppose, then, that this
bodily object which was beheld was dissolved and had perished, and
that nothing at all of it remained anywhere, to the vision of which
the gaze might have recourse; are we then to say, that because the
image of the bodily object thus now past and done with remains in
the memory, whence to form the conception in recollecting, and to
have the two united by will as a third, therefore it is the same
trinity as that former one, when the appearance of the bodily
object posited in place was seen? Certainly not, but altogether a
different one: for, not to say that that was from without, while
this is from within; the former certainly was produced by the
appearance of a present bodily object, the latter by the image of
that object now past. So, too, in the case of which we are now
treating, to illustrate which we have thought good to adduce this
example, the faith which is even now in our mind, as that bodily
object was in place, while held, looked at, loved, produces a sort
of trinity; but that trinity will exist no more, when this faith in
the mind, like that bodily object in place, shall no longer exist.
But that which will then exist, when we shall remember it to have
been, but not now to be, in us, will doubtless be a different one.
For that which now is, is wrought by the thing itself, actually
present and attached to the mind of one who believes; but that
which shall then be, will be wrought by the imagination of a past
thing left in the memory of one who recollects.</p>

is to Be Sought in the Immortality of the Rational Soul. How a
Trinity is Demonstrated in the Mind.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.iv-p2">6. Therefore neither is that
trinity an image of God, which is not now, nor is that other an
image of God, which then will not be; but we must find in the soul
of man, <i>i.e.</i>, <pb n="186" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_186.html" id="iv.i.xvi.iv-Page_186"/>the rational or intellectual
soul, that image of the Creator which is immortally implanted in
its immortality. For as the immortality itself of the soul is
spoken with a qualification; since the soul too has its proper
death, when it lacks a blessed life, which is to be called the true
life of the soul; but it is therefore called immortal, because it
never ceases to live with some life or other, even when it is most
miserable;&#8212;so, although reason or intellect is at one time torpid
in it, at another appears small, and at another great, yet the
human soul is never anything save rational or intellectual; and
hence, if it is made after the image of God in respect to this,
that it is able to use reason and intellect in order to understand
and behold God, then from the moment when that nature so marvellous
and so great began to be, whether this image be so worn out as to
be almost none at all, or whether it be obscure and defaced, or
bright and beautiful, certainly it always is. Further, too, pitying
the defaced condition of its dignity, divine Scripture tells us,
that &#8220;although man walks in an image, yet he disquieteth himself
in vain; he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather
them.&#8221;<note place="end" n="874" id="iv.i.xvi.iv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.iv-p3"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xxxix. 7" id="iv.i.xvi.iv-p3.2" parsed="|Ps|39|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.39.7">Ps. xxxix. 7</scripRef></p></note> It would not
therefore attribute vanity to the image of God, unless it perceived
it to have been defaced. Yet it sufficiently shows that such
defacing does not extend to the taking away its being an image, by
saying, &#8220;Although man walks in an image.&#8221; Wherefore in both
ways that sentence can be truly enunciated; in that, as it is said,
&#8220;Although man walketh in an image, yet he disquieteth himself in
vain,&#8221; so it may be said, &#8220;Although man disquieteth himself in
vain, yet he walketh in an image.&#8221; For although the nature of the
soul is great, yet it can be corrupted, because it is not the
highest; and although it can be corrupted, because it is not the
highest, yet because it is capable and can be partaker of the
highest nature, it is a great nature. Let us seek, then, in this
image of God a certain trinity of a special kind, with the aid of
Him who Himself made us after His own image. For no otherwise can
we healthfully investigate this subject, or arrive at any result
according to the wisdom which is from Him. But if the reader will
either hold in remembrance and recollect what we have said of the
human soul or mind in former books, and especially in the tenth, or
will carefully re-peruse it in the passages wherein it is
contained, he will not require here any more lengthy discourse
respecting the inquiry into so great a thing.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.iv-p4">7. We said, then, among other
things in the tenth book, that the mind of man knows itself. For
the mind knows nothing so much as that which is close to itself;
and nothing is more close to the mind than itself. We adduced also
other evidences, as much as seemed sufficient, whereby this might
be most certainly proved.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.v-p2">What, then, is to be said of the
mind of an infant, which is still so small, and buried in such
profound ignorance of things, that the mind of a man which knows
anything shrinks from the darkness of it? Is that too to be
believed to know itself; but that, as being too intent upon those
things which it has begun to perceive through the bodily senses,
with the greater delight in proportion to their novelty, it is not
able indeed to be ignorant of itself, but is also not able to think
of itself? Moreover, how intently it is bent upon sensible things
that are without it, may be conjectured from this one fact, that it
is so greedy of sensible light, that if any one through
carelessness, or ignorance of the possible consequences, place a
light at nighttime where an infant is lying down, on that side to
which the eyes of the child so lying down can be bent, but its neck
cannot be turned, the gaze of that child will be so fixed in that
direction, that we have known some to have come to squint by this
means, in that the eyes retained that form which habit in some way
impressed upon them while tender and soft.<note place="end" n="875" id="iv.i.xvi.v-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.v-p3"> [This occurred in the the case of
Edward Irving. Oliphant&#8217;s <i>Life of
Irving</i>.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> In the case, too, of the other
bodily senses, the souls of infants, as far as their age permits,
so narrow themselves as it were, and are bent upon them, that they
either vehemently detest or vehemently desire that only which
offends or allures through the flesh, but do not think of their own
inward self, nor can be made to do so by admonition; because they
do not yet know the signs that express admonition, whereof words
are the chief, of which as of other things they are wholly
ignorant. And that it is one thing not to know oneself, another not
to think of oneself, we have shown already in the same book.<note place="end" n="876" id="iv.i.xvi.v-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.v-p4"> Bk. x. c. 5.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.v-p5">8. But let us pass by the infantine
age, since we cannot question it as to what goes on within itself,
while we have ourselves pretty well forgotten it. Let it suffice
only for us hence to be certain, that when man has come to be able
to think of the nature of his own mind, and to find out what is the
truth, he <pb n="187" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_187.html" id="iv.i.xvi.v-Page_187"/>will find it nowhere else but in himself. And he will
find, not what he did not know, but that of which he did not think.
For what do we know, if we do not know what is in our own mind;
when we can know nothing at all of what we do know, unless by the
mind?</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xvi.vi-p1.1">Chapter 6.&#8212;How a Kind of Trinity Exists in the Mind
Thinking of Itself. What is the Part of Thought in This
Trinity.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.vi-p2">The function of thought, however,
is so great, that not even the mind itself can, so to say, place
itself in its own sight, except when it thinks of itself; and hence
it is so far the case, that nothing is in the sight of the mind,
except that which is being thought of, that not even the mind
itself, whereby we think whatever we do think, can be in its own
sight otherwise than by thinking of itself. But in <i>what way</i>
it is not in its own sight when it is not thinking of itself, while
it can never <i>be</i> without itself, as though itself were one
thing, and the sight of itself another, it is not in my power to
discover. For this is not unreasonably said of the eye of the body;
for the eye itself of the body is fixed in its own proper place in
the body, but its sight extends to things external to itself, and
reaches even to the stars. And the eye is not in its own sight,
since it does not look at itself, unless by means of a mirror, as
is said above;<note place="end" n="877" id="iv.i.xvi.vi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.vi-p3"> Bk. x. c. 3.</p></note> a thing that
certainly does not happen when the mind places itself in its own
sight by thinking of itself. Does it then see one part of itself by
means of another part of itself, when it looks at itself in
thought, as we look at some of our members, which can be in our
sight, with other also of our members, <i>viz</i>. with our eyes?
What can be said or thought more absurd? For by what is the mind
removed, except by itself? or where is it placed so as to be in its
own sight, except before itself? Therefore it will not be there,
where it was, when it was not in its own sight; because it has been
put down in one place, after being taken away from another. But if
it migrated in order to be beheld, where will it remain in order to
behold? Is it as it were doubled, so as to be in this and in that
place at the same time, <i>viz.</i> both where it can behold, and
where it can be beheld; that in itself it may be beholding, and
before itself beheld? If we ask the truth, it will tell us nothing
of the sort since it is but feigned images of bodily objects of
which we conceive when we conceive thus; and that the mind is not
such, is very certain to the few minds by which the truth on such a
subject can be inquired. It appears, therefore, that the beholding
of the mind is something pertaining to its nature, and is recalled
to that nature when it conceives of itself, not as if by moving
through space, but by an incorporeal conversion; but when it is not
conceiving of itself, it appears that it is not indeed in its own
sight, nor is its own perception formed from it, but yet that it
knows itself as though it were to itself a remembrance of itself.
Like one who is skilled in many branches of learning: the things
which he knows are contained in his memory, but nothing thereof is
in the sight of his mind except that of which he is conceiving;
while all the rest are stored up in a kind of secret knowledge,
which is called memory. The trinity, then, which we were setting
forth, was constituted in this way: first, we placed in the memory
the object by which the perception of the percipient was formed;
next, the conformation, or as it were the image which is impressed
thereby; lastly, love or will as that which combines the two. When
the mind, then, beholds itself in conception, it understands and
cognizes itself; it begets, therefore, this its own understanding
and cognition. For an incorporeal thing is understood when it is
beheld, and is cognized when understood. Yet certainly the mind
does not so beget this knowledge of itself, when it beholds itself
as understood by conception, as though it had before been unknown
to itself; but it was known to itself, in the way in which things
are known which are contained in the memory, but of which one is
not thinking; since we say that a man knows letters even when he is
thinking of something else, and not of letters. And these two, the
begetter and the begotten, are coupled together by love, as by a
third, which is nothing else than will, seeking or holding fast the
enjoyment of something. We held, therefore, that a trinity of the
mind is to be intimated also by these three terms, memory,
intelligence, will.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.vi-p4">9. But since the mind, as we said
near the end of the same tenth book, always remembers itself, and
always understands and loves itself, although it does not always
think of itself as distinguished from those things which are not
itself; we must inquire in what way understanding
(<i>intellectus</i>) belongs to conception, while the notion
(<i>notitia</i>) of each thing that is in the mind, even when one
is not thinking of it, is said to belong only to the memory. For if
this is so, then the mind had not these three things: <i>viz</i>.
the remembrance, the understanding, and the love of itself; but it
only remembered itself, and afterwards, 
<pb n="188" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_188.html" id="iv.i.xvi.vi-Page_188"/>when it began to think
of itself, then it understood and loved itself.</p>

What Way the Matter is Handled in Order to Help the
Reader.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.vii-p2">Wherefore let us consider more
carefully that example which we have adduced, wherein it was shown
that not knowing a thing is different from not thinking
[conceiving] of it; and that it may so happen that a man knows
something of which he is not thinking, when he is thinking of
something else, not of that. When any one, then, who is skilled in
two or more branches of knowledge is thinking of one of them,
though he is not thinking of the other or others, yet he knows
them. But can we rightly say, This musician certainly knows music,
but he does not now understand it, because he is not thinking of
it; but he does now understand geometry, for of that he is now
thinking? Such an assertion, as far as appears, is absurd. What,
again, if we were to say, This musician certainly knows music, but
he does not now love it, while he is not now thinking of it; but he
does now love geometry, because of that he is now thinking,&#8212;is
not this similarly absurd? But we say quite correctly, This person
whom you perceive disputing about geometry is also a perfect
musician, for he both remembers music, and understands, and loves
it; but although he both knows and loves it, he is not now thinking
of it, since he is thinking of geometry, of which he is disputing.
And hence we are warned that we have a kind of knowledge of certain
things stored up in the recesses of the mind, and that this, when
it is thought of, as it were, steps forth in public, and is placed
as if openly in the sight of the mind; for then the mind itself
finds that it both remembers, and understands, and loves itself,
even although it was not thinking of itself, when it was thinking
of something else. But in the case of that of which we have not
thought for a long time, and cannot think of it unless reminded;
that, if the phrase is allowable, in some wonderful way I know not
how, we do not <i>know</i> that we know. In short, it is rightly
said by him who reminds, to him whom he reminds, You know this, but
you do not know that you know it; I will remind you, and you will
find that you know what you had thought you did not know. Books,
too, lead to the same results, <i>viz</i>. those that are written
upon subjects which the reader under the guidance of reason finds
to be true; not those subjects which he believes to be true on the
faith of the narrator, as in the case of history; but those which
he himself also finds to be true, either of himself, or in that
truth itself which is the light of the mind. But he who cannot
contemplate these things, even when reminded, is too deeply buried
in the darkness of ignorance, through great blindness of heart and
too wonderfully needs divine help, to be able to attain to true
wisdom.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.vii-p3">10. For this reason I have wished
to adduce some kind of proof, be it what it might, respecting the
act of conceiving, such as might serve to show in what way, out of
the things contained in the memory, the mind&#8217;s eye is informed in
recollecting, and some such thing is begotten, when a man
conceives, as was already in him when, before he conceived, he
remembered; because it is easier to distinguish things that take
place at successive times, and where the parent precedes the
offspring by an interval of time. For if we refer ourselves to the
inner memory of the mind by which it remembers itself, and to the
inner understanding by which it understands itself, and to the
inner will by which it loves itself, where these three always are
together, and always have been together since they began to be at
all, whether they were being thought of or not; the image of this
trinity will indeed appear to pertain even to the memory alone; but
because in this case a word cannot be without a thought (for we <i>
think</i> all that we say, even if it be said by that inner word
which belongs to no separate language), this image is rather to be
discerned in these three things, <i>viz.</i> memory, intelligence,
will. And I mean now by intelligence that by which we understand in
thought, that is, when our thought is formed by the finding of
those things, which had been at hand to the memory but were not
being thought of; and I mean that will, or love, or preference
which combines this offspring and parent, and is in some way common
to both. Hence it was that I tried also, <i>viz.</i> in the
eleventh book, to lead on the slowness of readers by means of
outward sensible things which are seen by the eyes of the flesh;
and that I then proceeded to enter with them upon that power of the
inner man whereby he reasons of things temporal, deferring the
consideration of that which dominates as the higher power, by which
he contemplates things eternal. And I discussed this in two books,
distinguishing the two in the twelfth, the one of them being higher
and the other lower, and that the lower ought to be subject to the
higher; and in the thirteenth I discussed, with what truth and
brevity I could, the office of the lower, in which the wholesome
knowledge of things human is contained, in order that we may
so <pb n="189" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_189.html" id="iv.i.xvi.vii-Page_189"/>act in this temporal life as to attain that which is
eternal; since, indeed, I have cursorily included in a single book
a subject so manifold and copious, and one so well known by the
many and great arguments of many and great men, while manifesting
that a trinity exists also in it, but not yet one that can be
called an image of God.</p>

Now to Be Sought in the Noblest Part of the Mind.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.viii-p2">11. But we have come now to that
argument in which we have undertaken to consider the noblest part
of the human mind, by which it knows or can know God, in order that
we may find in it the image of God. For although the human mind is
not of the same nature with God, yet the image of that nature than
which none is better, is to be sought and found in us, in that than
which our nature also has nothing better. But the mind must first
be considered as it is in itself, before it becomes partaker of
God; and His image must be found in it. For, as we have said,
although worn out and defaced by losing the participation of God,
yet the image of God still remains.<note place="end" n="878" id="iv.i.xvi.viii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.viii-p3"> <i>Supra</i>, c. iv.</p></note> For it is His image in this very
point, that it is capable of Him, and can be partaker of Him; which
so great good is only made possible by its being His image. Well,
then, the mind remembers, understands, loves itself; if we discern
this, we discern a trinity, not yet indeed God, but now at last an
image of God. The memory does not receive from without that which
it is to hold; nor does the understanding find without that which
it is to regard, as the eye of the body does; nor has will joined
these two from without, as it joins the form of the bodily object
and that which is thence wrought in the vision of the beholder; nor
has conception, in being turned to it, found an image of a thing
seen without, which has been somehow seized and laid up in the
memory, whence the intuition of him that recollects has been
formed, will as a third joining the two: as we showed to take place
in those trinities which were discovered in things corporeal, or
which were somehow drawn within from bodily objects by the bodily
sense; of all which we have discoursed in the eleventh book.<note place="end" n="879" id="iv.i.xvi.viii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.viii-p4"> Cc. 2 sq.</p></note> Nor, again,
as it took place, or appeared to do so, when we went on further to
discuss that knowledge, which had its place now in the workings of
the inner man, and which was to be distinguished from wisdom; of
which knowledge the subject-matter was, as it were, adventitious to
the mind, and either was brought thither by historical
information,&#8212;as deeds and words, which are performed in time and
pass away, or which again are established in the nature of things
in their own times and places,&#8212;or arises in the man himself not
being there before, whether on the information of others, or by his
own thinking,&#8212;as faith, which we commended at length in the
thirteenth book, or as the virtues, by which, if they are true, one
so lives well in this mortality as to live blessedly in that
immortality which God promises. These and other things of the kind
have their proper order in time, and in that order we discerned
more easily a trinity of memory, sight, and love. For some of such
things anticipate the knowledge of learners. For they are knowable
also before they are known, and beget in the learner a knowledge of
themselves. And they either exist in their own proper places, or
have happened in time past; although things that are past do not
themselves exist, but only certain signs of them as past, the sight
or hearing of which makes it known that they have been and have
passed away. And these signs are either situate in the places
themselves, as <i>e.g.</i> monuments of the dead or the like; or
exist in written books worthy of credit, as is all history that is
of weight and approved authority; or are in the minds of those who
already know them; since what is already known to them is knowable
certainly to others also, whose knowledge it has anticipated, and
who are able to know it on the information of those who do know it.
And all these things, when they are learned, produce a certain kind
of trinity, <i>viz.</i> by their own proper species, which was
knowable also before it was known, and by the application to this
of the knowledge of the learner, which then begins to exist when he
learns them, and by will as a third which combines both; and when
they are known, yet another trinity is produced in the recollecting
of them, and this now inwardly in the mind itself, from those
images which, when they were learned, were impressed upon the
memory, and from the informing of the thought when the look has
been turned upon these by recollection, and from the will which as
a third combines these two. But those things which arise in the
mind, not having been there before, as faith and other things of
that kind, although they appear to be adventitious, since they are
implanted by teaching, yet are not situate without or transacted
without, as are those things which are believed; but began to be
altogether within in the mind itself. For faith is not that which
is believed, but that by which it is believed; and the
former <pb n="190" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_190.html" id="iv.i.xvi.viii-Page_190"/>is believed, the latter seen. Nevertheless, because it
began to be in the mind, which was a mind also before these things
began to be in it, it seems to be somewhat adventitious, and will
be reckoned among things past, when sight shall have succeeded, and
itself shall have ceased to be. And it makes now by its presence,
retained as it is, and beheld, and loved, a different trinity from
that which it will then make by means of some trace of itself,
which in passing it will have left in the memory: as has been
already said above.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.ix-p2">12. There is, however, some
question raised, whether the virtues likewise by which one lives
well in this present mortality, seeing that they themselves begin
also to be in the mind, which was a mind none the less when it
existed before without them, cease also to exist at that time when
they have brought us to things eternal. For some have thought that
they will cease, and in the case of three&#8212;prudence, fortitude,
temperance&#8212;such an assertion seems to have something in it; but
justice is immortal, and will rather then be made perfect in us
than cease to be. Yet Tullius, the great author of eloquence, when
arguing in the dialogue <i>Hortensius</i>, says of all four: &#8220;If
we were allowed, when we migrated from this life, to live forever
in the islands of the blessed, as fables tell, what need were there
of eloquence when there would be no trials, or what need, indeed,
of the very virtues themselves? For we should not need fortitude
when nothing of either toil or danger was proposed to us; nor
justice, when there was nothing of anybody else&#8217;s to be coveted;
nor temperance, to govern lusts that would not exist; nor, indeed,
should we need prudence, when there was no choice offered between
good and evil. We should be blessed, therefore, solely by learning
and knowing nature, by which alone also the life of the gods is
praiseworthy. And hence we may perceive that everything else is a
matter of necessity, but this is one of free choice.&#8221; This great
orator, then, when proclaiming the excellence of philosophy, going
over again all that he had learned from philosophers, and
excellently and pleasantly explaining it, has affirmed all four
virtues to be necessary in this life only, which we see to be full
of troubles and mistakes; but not one of them when we shall have
migrated from this life, if we are permitted to live there where is
a blessed life; but that blessed souls are blessed only in learning
and knowing, <i>i.e.</i> in the contemplation of nature, than which
nothing is better and more lovable. It is that nature which created
and appointed all other natures. And if it belongs to justice to be
subject to the government of this nature then justice is certainly
immortal; nor will it cease to be in that blessedness, but will be
such and so great that it cannot be more perfect or greater.
Perhaps, too, the other three virtues&#8212;prudence although no longer
with any risk of error, and fortitude without the vexation of
bearing evils, and temperance without the thwarting of lust&#8212;will
exist in that blessedness: so that it may be the part of prudence
to prefer or equal no good thing to God; and of fortitude, to
cleave to Him most steadfastly; and of temperance, to be pleased by
no harmful defect. But that which justice is now concerned with in
helping the wretched, and prudence in guarding against treachery,
and fortitude in bearing troubles patiently, and temperance in
controlling evil pleasures, will not exist there, where there will
be no evil at all. And hence those acts of the virtues which are
necessary to this mortal life, like the faith to which they are to
be referred, will be reckoned among things past; and they make now
a different trinity, whilst we hold, look at, and love them as
present, from that which they will then make, when we shall
discover them not to be, but to have been, by certain traces of
them which they will have left in passing in the memory; since
then, too, there will be a trinity, when that trace, be it of what
sort it may, shall be retained in the memory, and truly recognized,
and then these two be joined by will as a third.</p>

10.&#8212;How a Trinity is Produced by the Mind Remembering,
Understanding, and Loving Itself.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.x-p2">13. In the knowledge of all these
temporal things which we have mentioned, there are some knowable
things which precede the acquisition of the knowledge of them by an
interval of time, as in the case of those sensible objects which
were already real before they were known, or of all those things
that are learned through history; but some things begin to be at
the same time with the knowing of them,&#8212;just as, if any visible
object, which did not exist before at all, were to rise up before
our eyes, certainly it does not precede our knowing it; or if there
be any sound made where there is some one to hear, no doubt the
sound and the hearing that sound begin and end simultaneously. Yet
none the less, whether preceding in time or beginning to exist
simultaneously, knowable things generate knowl<pb n="191" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_191.html" id="iv.i.xvi.x-Page_191"/>edge, and
are not generated by knowledge. But when knowledge has come to
pass, whenever the things known and laid up in memory are reviewed
by recollection, who does not see that the retaining them in the
memory is prior in time to the sight of them in recollection, and
to the uniting of the two things by will as a third? In the mind,
howver, it is not so. For the mind is not adventitious to itself,
as though there came to itself already existing, that same self not
already existing, from somewhere else, or did not indeed come from
somewhere else, but that in the mind itself already existing, there
was born that same mind not already existing; just as faith, which
before was not, arises in the mind which already was. Nor does the
mind see itself, as it were, set up in its own memory by
recollection subsequently to the knowing of itself, as though it
was not there before it knew itself; whereas, doubtless, from the
time when it began to be, it has never ceased to remember, to
understand, and to love itself, as we have already shown. And
hence, when it is turned to itself by thought, there arises a
trinity, in which now at length we can discern also a word; since
it is formed from thought itself, will uniting both. Here, then, we
may recognize, more than we have hitherto done, the image of which
we are in search.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.xi-p2">14. But some one will say, That is
not memory by which the mind, which is ever present to itself, is
affirmed to remember itself; for memory is of things past, not of
things present. For there are some, and among them Cicero, who, in
treating of the virtues, have divided prudence into these
three&#8212;memory, understanding, forethought: to wit, assigning
memory to things past, understanding to things present, forethought
to things future; which last is certain only in the case of those
who are prescient of the future; and this is no gift of men, unless
it be granted from above, as to the prophets. And hence the book of
Wisdom, speaking of men, &#8220;The thoughts of mortals,&#8221; it says,
&#8220;are fearful, and our forethought uncertain.&#8221;<note place="end" n="880" id="iv.i.xvi.xi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.xi-p3"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. ix. 14" id="iv.i.xvi.xi-p3.2" parsed="|Wis|9|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.9.14">Wisd. ix. 14</scripRef></p></note> But memory of things past, and
understanding of things present, are certain: certain, I mean,
respecting things incorporeal, which are present; for things
corporeal are present to the sight of the corporeal eyes. But let
any one who denies that there is any memory of things present,
attend to the language used even in profane literature, where
exactness of words was more looked for than truth of things. &#8220;Nor
did Ulysses suffer such things, nor did the Ithacan forget himself
in so great a peril.&#8221;<note place="end" n="881" id="iv.i.xvi.xi-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.xi-p4"> <i>&#198;neid</i>, iii. 628, 629.</p></note> For when Virgil said that Ulysses
did not forget himself, what else did he mean, except that he
remembered himself? And since he was present to himself, he could
not possibly remember himself, unless memory pertained to things
present. And, therefore, as that is called memory in things past
which makes it possible to recall and remember them; so in a thing
present, as the mind is to itself, that is not unreasonably to be
called memory, which makes the mind at hand to itself, so that it
can be understood by its own thought, and then both be joined
together by love of itself.</p>

is not therefore the image of God, because the mind remembers

remember, understand, and love Him by whom it was made. And in so
doing it is made wise itself. But if it does not do so, even when
it remembers, understands, and loves itself, then it is foolish.
Let it then remember its God, after whose image it is made, and let
it understand and love Him. Or to say the same thing more briefly,
let it worship God, who is not made, by whom because itself was

you return to your own memory, and find in it that which had not

does not remember, or of which he is wholly ignorant. And hence is

mind, then, is so constituted, that at no time does it not
remember, and understand, and love itself. But since he who hates
any one is anxious to injure him, not undeservedly is the mind of
man also said to hate itself when it injures itself. For it wills
ill to itself through ignorance, in that it does not think that
what it wills is prejudicial to it; but it none the less does will
ill to itself, when it wills what would be prejudicial to it. And

does not love God, even if he does love himself,&#8212;a thing
implanted in him by nature,&#8212;yet is not unsuitably said to hate
himself, inasmuch as he does that which is adverse to himself, and
assails himself as though he were his own enemy. And this is no
doubt a terrible delusion, that whereas all will to profit
themselves, many do nothing but that which is most pernicious to
themselves. When the poet was describing a like disease of dumb
animals, &#8220;May the gods,&#8221; says he, &#8220;grant better things to the
pious, and assign that delusion to enemies. They were rending with
bare teeth their own torn limbs.&#8221;<note place="end" n="893" id="iv.i.xvi.xiv-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.xiv-p5"> Virg. <i>Georg</i>. iii.

he was speaking of, why has he called it a delusion, unless
because, while nature inclines every animal to take all the care it
can of itself, that disease was such that those animals rent those
very limbs of theirs which they desired should be safe and sound?
But when the mind loves God, and by consequence, as has been said
remembers and understands Him, then it is rightly enjoined also to
love its neighbor as itself; for it has now come to love itself
rightly and not perversely when it loves God, by partaking of whom
that image not only exists, but is also renewed so as to be no
longer old, and restored so as to be no longer defaced, and
beatified so as to be no longer unhappy. For although it so love
itself, that, supposing the alternative to be proposed to it, it
would lose all things which it loves less than itself rather than
perish; still, by abandoning Him who is above it, in dependence
upon whom alone it could guard its own strength, and enjoy Him as
its light, to whom it is sung in the Psalm, &#8220;I will guard my

even such a man walketh in an image, and the man&#8217;s mind has
remembrance, understanding, and love of itself; if it were made
plain to it that it could not have both, while it was permitted to
choose one and lose the other, <i>viz</i>. either the treasures it
has heaped up, or the mind; who is so utterly without mind, as to
prefer to have the treasures rather than the mind? For treasures
commonly are able to subvert the mind, but the mind that is not
subverted by treasures can live more easily and unencumberedly
without any treasures. But who will be able to possess treasures
unless it be by means of the mind? For if an infant, born as rich
as you please, although lord of everything that is rightfully his,
yet possesses nothing if his mind be unconscious, how can any one
possibly possess anything whose mind is wholly lost? But why say of
treasures, that anybody, if the choice be given him, prefers going
without them to going without a mind; when there is no one that
prefers, nay, no one that compares them, to those lights of the
body, by which not one man only here and there, as in the case of
gold, but every man, possesses the very heaven? For every one
possesses by the eyes of the body whatever he gladly sees. Who then
is there, who, if he could not keep both, but must lose one, would
not rather lose his treasures than his eyes? And yet if it were put
to him on the same condition, whether he would rather lose eyes
than mind, who is there with a mind that does not see that he would
rather lose the former than the latter? For a mind without the eyes
of the flesh is still human, but the eyes of the flesh without a
mind are bestial. And who would not rather be a man, even though
blind in fleshly sight, than a beast that can see?</p>

even those who are slower of understanding, to whose eyes or ears
this book may come, might be admonished, however briefly, how
greatly even a weak and erring mind loves itself, in wrongly loving
and pursuing things beneath itself. Now it could not love itself if

God within itself it has such power as to be able to cleave to Him
whose image it is. For it is so reckoned in the order, not of
place, but of natures, as that there is none above it save Him.
When, finally, it shall altogether cleave to Him, then it will be

no doubt, that it is wretched, and longs to be blessed nor can it
hope for the possibility of this on any other ground than its own
changeableness for if it were not changeable, then, as it could not
become wretched after being blessed, so neither could it become
blessed after being wretched. And what could have made it wretched
under an omnipotent and good God, except its own sin and the
righteousness of its Lord? And what will make it blessed, unless
its own merit, and its Lord&#8217;s reward? But its merit, too, is His
grace, whose reward will be its blessedness; for it cannot give
itself the righteousness it has lost, and so has not. For this it
received when man was created, and assuredly lost it by sinning.
Therefore it receives righteousness, that on account of this it may
deserve to receive blessedness; and hence the apostle truly says to
it, when beginning to be proud as it were of its own good, &#8220;For
what hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now if thou didst
receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received
it?&#8221;<note place="end" n="903" id="iv.i.xvi.xv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.xv-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 7" id="iv.i.xvi.xv-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|4|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.7">1 Cor. iv. 7</scripRef></p></note> But when it

does not remember its own blessedness; since that has been, but is

can remember Him. Not because it recollects the having known Him in
Adam or anywhere else before the life of this present body, or when

remembers nothing at all of all this. Whatever there is of this, it
has been blotted out by forgetfulness. But it is reminded, that it
may be turned to God, as though to that light by which it was in
some way touched, even when turned away from Him. For hence it is
that even the ungodly think of eternity, and rightly blame and
rightly praise many things in the morals of men. And by what rules
do they thus judge, except by those wherein they see how men ought
to live, even though they themselves do not so live? And where do
they see these rules? For they do not see them in their own [moral]
nature; since no doubt these things are to be seen by the mind, and
their minds are confessedly changeable, but these rules are seen as
unchangeable by him who can see them at all; nor yet in the
character of their own mind, since these rules are rules of
righteousness, and their minds are confessedly unrighteous. Where
indeed are these rules written, wherein even the unrighteous
recognizes what is righteous, wherein he discerns that he ought to
have what he himself has not? Where, then, are they written, unless
in the book of that Light which is called Truth? whence every
righteous law is <pb n="195" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_195.html" id="iv.i.xvi.xv-Page_195"/>copied and transferred (not by
migrating to it, but by being as it were impressed upon it) to the
heart of the man that worketh righteousness; as the impression from
a ring passes into the wax, yet does not leave the ring. But he who
worketh not, and yet sees how he ought to work, he is the man that
is turned away from that light, which yet touches him. But he who
does not even see how he ought to live, sins indeed with more
excuse, because he is not a transgressor of a law that he knows;
but even he too is just touched sometimes by the splendor of the
everywhere present truth, when upon admonition he
confesses.</p>

more plainly called it an image, while enforcing the same thing in
other words. &#8220;Do you,&#8221; he says, &#8220;putting off the old man with

righteousness and true holiness,&#8221; he has put in the latter, &#8220;In
the knowledge of God.&#8221; This renewal, then, and forming again of
the mind, is wrought either after God, or after the image of God.
But it is said to be after God, in order that it may not be
supposed to be after another creature; and to be after the image of
God, in order that this renewing may be understood to take place in
that wherein is the image of God, <i>i.e.</i> in the mind. Just as
we say, that he who has departed from the body a faithful and
righteous man, is dead after the body, not after the spirit. For
what do we mean by dead after the body, unless as to <pb n="196" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_196.html" id="iv.i.xvi.xvi-Page_196"/>the body or
in the body, and not dead as to the soul or in the soul? Or if we
want to say he is handsome after the body, or strong after the
body, not after the mind; what else is this, than that he is
handsome or strong in body, not in mind? And the same is the case

take place in the single moment of conversion itself, as that
renewal in baptism takes place in a single moment by the remission
of all sins; for not one, be it ever so small, remains unremitted.
But as it is one thing to be free from fever, and another to grow
strong again from the infirmity which the fever produced; and one
thing again to pluck out of the body a weapon thrust into it, and
another to heal the wound thereby made by a prosperous cure; so the
first cure is to remove the cause of infirmity, and this is wrought
by the forgiving of all sins; but the second cure is to heal the
infirmity itself, and this takes place gradually by making progress
in the renewal of that image: which two things are plainly shown in
the Psalm, where we read, &#8220;Who forgiveth all thine iniquities,&#8221;
which takes place in baptism; and then follows, &#8220;and healeth all
thine infirmities;&#8221;<note place="end" n="917" id="iv.i.xvi.xvii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.xvii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Ps. ciii. 3" id="iv.i.xvi.xvii-p3.2" parsed="|Ps|103|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.103.3">Ps. ciii. 3</scripRef></p></note> and this takes place by daily

is a seal of it. In saying that &#8220;the forgiveness of all thine

eternal, from things visible to things intelligible, from things
carnal to things spiritual; and diligently perseveres in bridling

Son, because He only in the Trinity took a body, in which He died
and rose again, and which He carried with Him to heaven above. For
this, too, is called an image of the Son of God, in which we shall
have, as He has, an immortal body, being conformed in this respect

which I believe is properly called wisdom as distinct from
knowledge in the sacred writings; but wisdom only of man, which yet
man has not except from Him, by partaking of whom a rational and
intellectual mind can be made truly wise;&#8212;this contemplative
wisdom, I say, it is that Cicero commends, in the end of the
dialogue <i>Hortensius</i>, when he says: &#8220;While, then, we
consider these things night and day, and sharpen our understanding,
which is the eye of the mind, taking care that it be not ever
dulled, that is, while we live in philosophy; we, I say, in so
doing, have great hope that, if, on the one hand, this sentiment
and wisdom of ours is mortal and perishable, we shall still, when
we have discharged our human offices, have a pleasant setting, and
a not painful extinction, and as it were a rest from life: or if,
on the other, as ancient philosophers thought,&#8212;and those, too,
the greatest and far the most celebrated,&#8212;we have souls eternal
and divine, then must we needs think, that the more these shall
have always kept in their own proper course, <i>i.e.</i> in reason
and in the desire of inquiry, and the less they shall have mixed
and entangled themselves in the vices and errors of men, the more
easy ascent and return they will have to heaven.&#8221; And then he
says, adding this short sentence, and finishing his discourse by
repeating it: &#8220;Wherefore, to end my discourse at last, if we wish
either for a tranquil extinction, after living in the pursuit of
these subjects, or if to migrate without delay from this present
home to another in no little measure better, we must bestow all our
labor and care upon these pursuits.&#8221; And here I marvel, that a
man of such great ability should promise to men living in
philosophy, which makes man blessed by contemplation of truth, &#8220;a
pleasant setting after the discharge of human offices, if this our
sentiment and wisdom is mortal and perishable;&#8221; as if that which
we did not love, or rather which we fiercely hated, were then to
die and come to nothing, so that its setting would be pleasant to
us! But indeed he had not learned this from the philosophers, whom
he extols with great praise; but this sentiment is redolent of that
New Academy, wherein it pleased him to doubt of even <pb n="198" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_198.html" id="iv.i.xvi.xix-Page_198"/>the plainest
things. But from the philosophers that were greatest and far most
celebrated, as he himself confesses, he had learned that souls are
eternal. For souls that are eternal are not unsuitably stirred up
by the exhortation to be found in &#8220;their own proper course,&#8221;
when the end of this life shall have come, <i>i.e.</i> &#8220;in reason
and in the desire of inquiry,&#8221; and to mix and entangle themselves
the less in the vices and errors of men, in order that they may
have an easier return to God. But that course which consists in the
love and investigation of truth does not suffice for the wretched,
<i>i.e.</i> for all mortals who have only this kind of reason, and
are without faith in the Mediator; as I have taken pains to prove,
as much as I could, in former books of this work, especially in the

concerning the Trinity, which is God, in those eternal,

contemplation of which a blessed life is promised to us. But this
Trinity, as he shows, is here seen by us as by a mirror and in an
enigma, in that it is seen by means of the image of God, which we
are, as in a likeness that is obscure and hard of discernment. In
like manner, it is shown, that some kind of conjecture and
explanation may be gathered respecting the generation of the divine
Word, from the word of our own mind, but only with difficulty, on
account of the exceeding disparity which is discernible between the
two words; and, again, respecting the procession of the Holy
Spirit, from the love that is joined thereto by the
will.</p>

Desiring</span> to exercise the reader in the things that are made,
in order that he may know Him by whom they are made, we have now
advanced so far as to His image, which is man, in that wherein he

business to demonstrate not only to believers, by authority of
divine Scripture, but also to such as understand, by some kind of
reason, if we can. And why I say, if we can, the thing itself will

ever better and better while seeking so great a good, which is both
sought in order to be found, and found in order to be sought? For
it is both sought in order that it may be found more sweetly, and
found in order that it may be sought more eagerly. The words of
Wisdom in the book of Ecclesiasticus may be taken in this meaning:
&#8220;They who eat me shall still be hungry, and they who drink me
shall still be thirsty.&#8221;<note place="end" n="940" id="iv.i.xvii.ii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.ii-p5"> <scripRef passage="Ecclus. xxiv. 22" id="iv.i.xvii.ii-p5.2" parsed="|Sir|24|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.24.22">Ecclus. xxiv. 22</scripRef></p></note> For they eat and drink because they

seeks Him, whom it finds; for &#8220;God looked down upon the sons of

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p1.1">Chapter 3.&#8212;A Brief
Recapitulation of All the Previous Books.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p2">4. But since the necessities of our
discussion and argument have compelled us to say a great many
things in the course of fourteen books, which we cannot view at
once in one glance, so as to be able to refer them quickly in
thought to that which we desire to grasp, I will attempt, by the
help of God, to the best of my power, to put briefly together,
without arguing, whatever I have established in the several books
by argument as known, and to place, as it were, under one mental
view, not the way in which we have been convinced of each point,
but the points themselves of which we have been convinced; in order
that what follows may not be so far separated from that which
precedes, as that the perusal of the former shall produce
forgetfulness of the latter; or at any rate, if it have produced
such forgetfulness, that what has escaped the memory may be
speedily recalled by re-perusal.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p3">5. In the first book, the unity and
equality of that highest Trinity is shown from Holy Scripture. In
the second, and third, and fourth, the same: but a careful handling
of the question respecting the sending of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit has resulted in three books; and we have demonstrated, that
He who is sent is not therefore less than He who sends because the
one sent, the other was sent; since the Trinity, which is in all
things equal, being also equally in its own nature unchangeable,
and invisible, and everywhere present, works indivisibly. In the
fifth,&#8212;with a view to those who think that the substance of the
Father and of the Son is therefore not the same, because they
suppose everything that is predicated of God to be predicated
according to substance, and therefore contend that to beget and to
be begotten, or to be begotten and unbegotten, as being diverse,
are diverse substances,&#8212;it is demonstrated that not everything
that is predicated of God is predicated according to substance, as
He is called good and great according to substance, or anything
else that is predicated of Him in respect to Himself, but that some
things also are predicated relatively, <i>i.e.</i> not in respect
to Himself, but in respect to something which is not Himself; as He
is called the Father in respect to the Son, or the Lord in respect
to the creature that serves Him; and that here, if anything thus
relatively predicated, <i>i.e.</i> predicated in respect to
something that is not Himself, is predicated also as in time, as,
<i>e.g.</i>, &#8220;Lord, Thou hast become our <pb n="201" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_201.html" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-Page_201"/>refuge,&#8221;<note place="end" n="945" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xc. 1" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p4.2" parsed="|Ps|90|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.90.1">Ps. xc. 1</scripRef></p></note> then nothing
happens to Him so as to work a change in Him, but He Himself
continues altogether unchangeable in His own nature or essence. In
the sixth, the question how Christ is called by the mouth of the
apostle &#8220;the power of God and the wisdom of God,&#8221;<note place="end" n="946" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 24" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p5.2" parsed="|1Cor|1|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.24">1 Cor. i. 24</scripRef></p></note> is so far
argued that the more careful handling of that question is deferred,
<i>viz</i>. whether He from whom Christ is begotten is not wisdom
Himself, but only the father of His own wisdom, or whether wisdom
begat wisdom. But be it which it may, the equality of the Trinity
became apparent in this book also, and that God was not triple, but
a Trinity; and that the Father and the Son are not, as it were, a
double as opposed to the single Holy Spirit: for therein three are
not anything more than one. We considered, too, how to understand
the words of Bishop Hilary, &#8220;Eternity in the Father, form in the
Image, use in the Gift.&#8221; In the seventh, the question is
explained which had been deferred: in what way that God who begat
the Son is not only Father of His own power and wisdom, but is
Himself also power and wisdom; so, too, the Holy Spirit; and yet
that they are not three powers or three wisdoms, but one power and
one wisdom, as one God and one essence. It was next inquired, in
what way they are called one essence, three persons, or by some
Greeks one essence, three substances; and we found that the words
were so used through the needs of speech, that there might be one
term by which to answer, when it is asked what the three are, whom
we truly confess to be three, <i>viz</i>. Father, and Son, and Holy
Spirit. In the eighth, it is made plain by reason also to those who
understand, that not only the Father is not greater than the Son in
the substance of truth, but that both together are not anything
greater than the Holy Spirit alone, nor that any two at all in the
same Trinity are anything greater than one, nor all three together
anything greater than each severally. Next, I have pointed out,
that by means of the truth, which is beheld by the understanding,
and by means of the highest good, from which is all good, and by
means of the righteousness for which a righteous mind is loved even
by a mind not yet righteous, we might understand, so far as it is
possible to understand, that not only incorporeal but also
unchangeable nature which is God; and by means, too, of love, which
in the Holy Scriptures is called God,<note place="end" n="947" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p6"> <scripRef passage="1 John iv. 16" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p6.2" parsed="|1John|4|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.4.16">1 John iv. 16</scripRef></p></note> by which, first of all, those who
have understanding begin also, however feebly, to discern the
Trinity, to wit, one that loves, and that which is loved, and love.
In the ninth, the argument advances as far as to the image of God,
<i>viz</i>. man in respect to his mind; and in this we found a kind
of trinity, <i>i.e.</i> the mind, and the knowledge whereby the
mind knows itself, and the love whereby it loves both itself and
its knowledge of itself; and these three are shown to be mutually
equal, and of one essence. In the tenth, the same subject is more
carefully and subtly handled, and is brought to this point, that we
found in the mind a still more manifest trinity of the mind, <i>
viz.</i> in memory, and understanding, and will. But since it
turned out also, that the mind could never be in such a case as not
to remember, understand, and love itself, although it did not
always think of itself; but that when it did think of itself, it
did not in the same act of thought distinguish itself from things
corporeal; the argument respecting the Trinity, of which this is an
image, was deferred, in order to find a trinity also in the things
themselves that are seen with the body, and to exercise the
reader&#8217;s attention more distinctly in that. Accordingly, in the
eleventh, we chose the sense of sight, wherein that which should
have been there found to hold good might be recognized also in the
other four bodily senses, although not expressly mentioned; and so
a trinity of the outer man first showed itself in those things
which are discerned from without, to wit, from the bodily object
which is seen, and from the form which is thence impressed upon the
eye of the beholder, and from the purpose of the will combining the
two. But these three things, as was patent, were not mutually equal
and of one substance. Next, we found yet another trinity in the
mind itself, introduced into it, as it were, by the things
perceived from without; wherein the same three things, as it
appeared, were of one substance: the image of the bodily object
which is in the memory, and the form thence impressed when the
mind&#8217;s eye of the thinker is turned to it, and the purpose of the
will combining the two. But we found this trinity to pertain to the
outer man, on this account, that it was introduced into the mind
from bodily objects which are perceived from without. In the
twelfth, we thought good to distinguish wisdom from knowledge, and
to seek first, as being the lower of the two, a kind of appropriate
and special trinity in that which is specially called knowledge;
but that although we have got now in this to something pertaining
to the inner man, yet it is not yet to be either called or thought
an image of God. And this is discussed in the thirteenth book by
the commendation of Christian faith. In the <pb n="202" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_202.html" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-Page_202"/>fourteenth
we discuss the true wisdom of man, <i>viz</i>. that which is
granted him by God&#8217;s gift in the partaking of that very God
Himself, which is distinct from knowledge; and the discussion
reached this point, that a trinity is discovered in the image of
God, which is man in respect to his mind, which mind is &#8220;renewed
in the knowledge&#8221; of God, &#8220;after the image of Him that
created&#8221; man;<note place="end" n="948" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p7"> <scripRef passage="Col. iii. 10" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p7.2" parsed="|Col|3|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.3.10">Col. iii. 10</scripRef></p></note> &#8220;after His

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xvii.iv-p1.1">Chapter 4.&#8212;What Universal
Nature Teaches Us Concerning God.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.iv-p2">6. Let us, then, now seek the
Trinity which is God, in the things themselves that are eternal,
incorporeal, and unchangeable; in the perfect contemplation of
which a blessed life is promised us, which cannot be other than
eternal. For not only does the authority of the divine books
declare that God is; but the whole nature of the universe itself
which surrounds us, and to which we also belong, proclaims that it
has a most excellent Creator, who has given to us a mind and
natural reason, whereby to see that things living are to be
preferred to things that are not living; things that have sense to
things that have not; things that have understanding to things that
have not; things immortal to things mortal; things powerful to
things impotent; things righteous to things unrighteous; things
beautiful to things deformed; things good to things evil; things
incorruptible to things corruptible; things unchangeable to things
changeable; things invisible to things visible; things incorporeal
to things corporeal; things blessed to things miserable. And hence,
since without doubt we place the Creator above things created, we
must needs confess that the Creator both lives in the highest
sense, and perceives and understands all things, and that He cannot
die, or suffer decay, or be changed; and that He is not a body, but
a spirit, of all the most powerful, most righteous, most beautiful,
most good, most blessed.</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p1.1">Chapter 5.&#8212;How Difficult It
is to Demonstrate the Trinity by Natural Reason.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p2">7. But all that I have said, and
whatever else seems to be worthily said of God after the like
fashion of human speech, applies to the whole Trinity, which is one
God, and to the several Persons in that Trinity. For who would dare
to say either of the one God, which is the Trinity itself, or of
the Father, or Son, or Holy Spirit, either that He is not living,
or is without sense or intelligence; or that, in that nature in
which they are affirmed to be mutually equal, any one of them is
mortal, or corruptible, or changeable, or corporeal? Or is there
any one who would deny that any one in the Trinity is most
powerful, most righteous, most beautiful, most good, most blessed?
If, then, these things, and all others of the kind, can be
predicated both of the Trinity itself, and of each several one in
that Trinity, where or how shall the Trinity manifest itself? Let
us therefore first reduce these numerous predicates to some limited
number. For that which is called life in God, is itself His essence
and nature. God, therefore, does not live, unless by the life which
He is to Himself. And this life is not such as that which is in a
tree, wherein is neither understanding nor sense; nor such as is in
a beast, for the life of a beast possesses the fivefold sense, but
has no understanding. But the life which is God perceives and
understands all things, and perceives by mind, not by body, because
&#8220;God is a spirit.&#8221;<note place="end" n="950" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p3"> <scripRef passage="John iv. 24" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p3.2" parsed="|John|4|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.4.24">John iv. 24</scripRef></p></note> And God does not perceive through a
body, as animals do, which have bodies, for He does not consist of
soul and body. And hence that single nature perceives as it
understands, and understands as it perceives, and its sense and
understanding are one and the same. Nor yet so, that at any time He
should either cease or begin to be; for He is immortal. And it is
not said of Him in vain, that &#8220;He only hath immortality.&#8221;<note place="end" n="951" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p4"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 16" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p4.2" parsed="|1Tim|6|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.16">1 Tim. vi. 16</scripRef></p></note> For
immortality is true immortality in His case whose nature admits no
change. That is also true eternity by which God is unchangeable,
without beginning, without end; consequently also incorruptible. It
is one and the same thing, therefore, to call God eternal, or
immortal, or incorruptible, or unchangeable; and it is likewise one
and the same thing to say that He is living, and that He is
intelligent, that is, in truth, wise. For He did not receive wisdom
whereby to be wise, but He is Himself wisdom. And this is life, and
again is power or might, and yet again beauty, whereby He is called
powerful and beautiful. For what is more powerful and more
beautiful than wisdom, &#8220;which reaches from end to end mightily,
and sweetly disposes all things&#8221;?<note place="end" n="952" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p5"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. viii. 1" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p5.2" parsed="|Wis|8|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.8.1">Wisd. viii. 1</scripRef></p></note> Or do goodness, again, and
righteousness, differ from each other in the nature of God, as they
differ in His works, as though they were two diverse qualities of
God&#8212;goodness one, and righteousness an<pb n="203" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_203.html" id="iv.i.xvii.v-Page_203"/>other?
Certainly not; but that which is righteousness is also itself
goodness; and that which is goodness is also itself blessedness.
And God is therefore called incorporeal, that He may be believed
and understood to be a spirit, not a body.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p6">8. Further, if we say, Eternal,
immortal, incorruptible, unchangeable, living, wise, powerful,
beautiful, righteous, good, blessed spirit; only the last of this
list as it were seems to signify substance, but the rest to signify
qualities of that substance; but it is not so in that ineffable and
simple nature. For whatever seems to be predicated therein
according to quality, is to be understood according to substance or
essence. For far be it from us to predicate spirit of God according
to substance, and good according to quality; but both according to
substance.<note place="end" n="953" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p7"> [In the Infinite Being, qualities
are inseparable from essence; in the finite being, they are
separable. If man or angel ceases to be good, or wise, or
righteous, he does not thereby cease to be man or angel. But if God
should lose goodness, wisdom or righteousness, he would no longer
be God. This is the meaning of Augustin, when he says that
&#8220;goodness&#8221; as well as &#8220;spirit&#8221; must be predicated of God,
&#8220;according to substance&#8221;&#8212;that is, that qualities in God are
<i>essential</i> qualities. They are so one with the essence, that
they are inseparable.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> And so in
like manner of all those we have mentioned, of which we have
already spoken at length in the former books. Let us choose, then,
one of the first four of those in our enumeration and arrangement,
<i>i.e.</i> eternal, immortal, incorruptible, unchangeable; since
these four, as I have argued already, have one meaning; in order
that our aim may not be distracted by a multiplicity of objects.
And let it be rather that which was placed first, <i>viz</i>.
eternal. Let us follow the same course with the four that come
next, <i>viz</i>. living, wise, powerful, beautiful. And since life
of some sort belongs also to the beast, which has not wisdom; while
the next two, <i>viz</i>. wisdom and might, are so compared to one
another in the case of man, as that Scripture says, &#8220;Better is he
that is wise than he that is strong;&#8221;<note place="end" n="954" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p8"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. vi. 1" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p8.2" parsed="|Wis|6|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.6.1">Wisd. vi. 1</scripRef></p></note> and beauty, again, is commonly
attributed to bodily objects also: out of these four that we have
chosen, let Wise be the one we take. Although these four are not to
be called unequal in speaking of God; for they are four names, but
one thing. But of the third and last four,&#8212;although it is the
same thing in God to be righteous that it is to be good or to be
blessed; and the same thing to be a spirit that it is to be
righteous, and good, and blessed; yet, because in men there can be
a spirit that is not blessed, and there can be one both righteous
and good, but not yet blessed; but that which is blessed is
doubtless both just, and good, and a spirit,&#8212;let us rather choose
that one which cannot exist even in men without the three others,
<i>viz</i>. blessed.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p2">9. When, then, we say, Eternal,
wise, blessed, are these three the Trinity that is called God? We
reduce, indeed, those twelve to this small number of three; but
perhaps we can go further, and reduce these three also to one of
them. For if wisdom and might, or life and wisdom, can be one and
the same thing in the nature of God, why cannot eternity and
wisdom, or blessedness and wisdom, be one and the same thing in the
nature of God? And hence, as it made no difference whether we spoke
of these twelve or of those three when we reduced the many to the
small number; so does it make no difference whether we speak of
those three, or of that one, to the singularity of which we have
shown that the other two of the three may be reduced. What fashion,
then, of argument, what possible force and might of understanding,
what liveliness of reason, what sharp-sightedness of thought, will
set forth how (to pass over now the others) this one thing, that
God is called wisdom, is a trinity? For God does not receive wisdom
from any one as we receive it from Him, but He is Himself His own
wisdom; because His wisdom is not one thing, and His essence
another, seeing that to Him to be wise is to be. Christ, indeed, is
called in the Holy Scriptures, &#8220;the power of God, and the wisdom
of God.&#8221;<note place="end" n="955" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 24" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|1|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.24">1 Cor. i. 24</scripRef></p></note> But we have
discussed in the seventh book how this is to be understood, so that
the Son may not seem to make the Father wise; and our explanation
came to this, that the Son is wisdom of wisdom, in the same way as
He is light of light, God of God. Nor could we find the Holy Spirit
to be in any other way than that He Himself also is wisdom, and
altogether one wisdom, as one God, one essence. How, then, do we
understand this wisdom, which is God, to be a trinity? I do not
say, How do we believe this? For among the faithful this ought to
admit no question. But supposing there is any way by which we can
see with the understanding what we believe, what is that
way?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p4">10. For if we recall where it was
in these books that a trinity first began to show itself
<pb n="204" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_204.html" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-Page_204"/>to our
understanding, the eighth book is that which occurs to us; since it
was there that to the best of our power we tried to raise the aim
of the mind to understand that most excellent and unchangeable
nature, which our mind is not. And we so contemplated this nature
as to think of it as not far from us, and as above us, not in
place, but by its own awful and wonderful excellence, and in such
wise that it appeared to be with us by its own present light. Yet
in this no trinity was yet manifest to us, because in that blaze of
light we did not keep the eye of the mind steadfastly bent upon
seeking it; only we discerned it in a sense, because there was no
bulk wherein we must needs think the magnitude of two or three to
be more than that of one. But when we came to treat of love, which
in the Holy Scriptures is called God,<note place="end" n="956" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 John iv. 16" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p5.2" parsed="|1John|4|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.4.16">1 John iv. 16</scripRef></p></note> then a trinity began to dawn upon
us a little, <i>i.e.</i> one that loves, and that which is loved,
and love. But because that ineffable light beat back our gaze, and
it became in some degree plain that the weakness of our mind could
not as yet be tempered to it, we turned back in the midst of the
course we had begun, and planned according to the (as it were) more
familiar consideration of our own mind, according to which man is
made after the image of God,<note place="end" n="957" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p6"> <scripRef passage="Gen. i. 27" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p6.2" parsed="|Gen|1|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.27">Gen. i. 27</scripRef></p></note> in order to relieve our
overstrained attention; and thereupon we dwelt from the ninth to
the fourteenth book upon the consideration of the creature, which
we are, that we might be able to understand and behold the
invisible things of God by those things which are made. And now
that we have exercised the understanding, as far as was needful, or
perhaps more than was needful, in lower things, lo! we wish, but
have not strength, to raise ourselves to behold that highest
Trinity which is God. For in such manner as we see most undoubted
trinities, whether those which are wrought from without by
corporeal things, or when these same things are thought of which
were perceived from without; or when those things which take their
rise in the mind, and do not pertain to the senses of the body, as
faith, or as the virtues which comprise the art of living, are
discerned by manifest reason, and, held fast by knowledge; or when
the mind itself, by which we know whatever we truly say that we
know, is known to itself, or thinks of itself; or when that mind
beholds anything eternal and unchangeable, which itself is
not;&#8212;in such way, then, I say, as we see in all these instances
most undoubted trinities, because they are wrought in ourselves, or
are in ourselves, when we remember, look at, or desire these
things;&#8212;do we, I say, in such manner also see the Trinity that is
God; because there also, by the understanding, we behold both Him
as it were speaking, and His Word, <i>i.e.</i> the Father and the
Son; and then, proceeding thence, the love common to both, namely,
the Holy Spirit? These trinities that pertain to our senses or to
our mind, do we rather see than believe them, but rather believe
than see that God is a trinity? But if this is so, then doubtless
we either do not at all understand and behold the invisible things
of God by those things that are made, or if we behold them at all,
we do not behold the Trinity in them; and there is therein somewhat
to behold, and somewhat also which we ought to believe, even though
not beheld. And as the eighth book showed that we behold the
unchangeable good which we are not, so the fourteenth reminded us
thereof, when we spoke of the wisdom that man has from God. Why,
then, do we not recognize the Trinity therein? Does that wisdom
which God is said to be, not perceive itself, and not love itself?
Who would say this? Or who is there that does not see, that where
there is no knowledge, there in no way is there wisdom? Or are we,
in truth, to think that the Wisdom which is God knows other things,
and does not know itself; or loves other things, and does not love
itself? But if this is a foolish and impious thing to say or
believe, then behold we have a trinity,&#8212;to wit, wisdom, and the
knowledge wisdom has of itself, and its love of itself. For so,
too, we find a trinity in man also, <i>i.e.</i> mind, and the
knowledge wherewith mind knows itself, and the love wherewith it
loves itself.</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xvii.vii-p1.1">Chapter 7.&#8212;That It is Not Easy to Discover the Trinity
that is God from the Trinities We Have Spoken of.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.vii-p2">11. But these three are in such way
in man, that they are not themselves man. For man, as the ancients
defined him, is a rational mortal animal. These things, therefore,
are the chief things in man, but are not man themselves. And any
one person, <i>i.e.</i> each individual man, has these three things
in his mind. But if, again, we were so to define man as to say, Man
is a rational substance consisting of mind and body, then without
doubt man has a soul that is not body, and a body that is not soul.
And hence these three things are not man, but belong to man, or are
in man. If, again, we put aside the body, and think of the soul
by <pb n="205" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_205.html" id="iv.i.xvii.vii-Page_205"/>itself, the mind is somewhat belonging to the soul, as
though its head, or eye, or countenance; but these things are not
to be regarded as bodies. It is not then the soul, but that which
is chief in the soul, that is called the mind. But can we say that
the Trinity is in such way in God, as to be somewhat belonging to
God, and not itself God? And hence each individual man, who is
called the image of God, not according to all things that pertain
to his nature, but according to his mind alone, is one person, and
is an image of the Trinity in his mind. But that Trinity of which
he is the image is nothing else in its totality than God, is
nothing else in its totality than the Trinity. Nor does anything
pertain to the nature of God so as not to pertain to that Trinity;
and the Three Persons are of one essence, not as each individual
man is one person.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.vii-p3">12. There is, again, a wide
difference in this point likewise, that whether we speak of the
mind in a man, and of its knowledge and love; or of memory,
understanding, will,&#8212;we remember nothing of the mind except by
memory, nor understand anything except by understanding, nor love
anything except by will. But in that Trinity, who would dare to say
that the Father understands neither Himself, nor the Son, nor the
Holy Spirit, except by the Son, or loves them except by the Holy
Spirit; and that He remembers only by Himself either Himself, or
the Son, or the Holy Spirit; and in the same way that the Son
remembers neither Himself nor the Father, except by the Father, nor
loves them except by the Holy Spirit; but that by Himself He only
understands both the Father and Son and Holy Spirit: and in like
manner, that the Holy Spirit by the Father remembers both the
Father and the Son and Himself, and by the Son understands both the
Father and the Son and Himself; but by Himself only loves both
Himself and the Father and the Son;&#8212;as though the Father were
both His own memory, and that of the Son and of the Holy Spirit;
and the Son were the understanding of both Himself, and the Father
and the Holy Spirit; but the Holy Spirit were the love both of
Himself, and of the Father and of the Son? Who would presume to
think or affirm this of that Trinity? For if therein the Son alone
understands both for Himself and for the Father and for the Holy
Spirit, we have returned to the old absurdity, that the Father is
not wise from Himself, but from the Son, and that wisdom has not
begotten wisdom, but that the Father is said to be wise by that
wisdom which He begat. For where there is no understanding there
can be no wisdom; and hence, if the Father does not understand
Himself for Himself, but the Son understands for the Father,
assuredly the Son makes the Father wise. But if to God to be is to
be wise, and essence is to Him the same as wisdom, then it is not
the Son that has His essence from the Father, which is the truth,
but rather the Father from the Son, which is a most absurd
falsehood. And this absurdity, beyond all doubt, we have discussed,
disproved, and rejected, in the seventh book. Therefore God the
Father is wise by that wisdom by which He is His own wisdom, and
the Son is the wisdom of the Father from the wisdom which is the
Father, from whom the Son is begotten; whence it follows that the
Father understands also by that understanding by which He is His
own understanding (for he could not be Wise that did not
understand); and that the Son is the understanding of the Father,
begotten of the understanding which is the Father. And this same
may not be unfitly said of memory also. For how is he wise, that
remembers nothing, or does not remember himself? Accordingly, since
the Father is wisdom, and the Son is wisdom, therefore, as the
Father remembers Himself, so does the Son also remember Himself;
and as the Father remembers both Himself and the Son, not by the
memory of the Son, but by His own, so does the Son remember both
Himself and the Father, not by the memory of the Father, but by His
own. Where, again, there is no love, who would say there was any
wisdom? And hence we must infer that the Father is in such way His
own love, as He is His own understanding and memory. And therefore
these three, <i>i.e.</i> memory, understanding, love or will in
that highest and unchangeable essence which is God, are, we see,
not the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, but the Father
alone. And because the Son too is wisdom begotten of wisdom, as
neither the Father nor the Holy Spirit understands for Him, but He
understands for Himself; so neither does the Father remember for
Him, nor the Holy Spirit love for Him, but He remembers and loves
for Himself: for He is Himself also His own memory, His own
understanding, and His own love. But that He is so comes to Him
from the Father, of whom He is born. And because the Holy Spirit
also is wisdom proceeding from wisdom, He too has not the Father
for a memory, and the Son for an understanding, and Himself for
love: for He would not be wisdom if another remembered for Him, and
yet another understood for Him, and He only loved for Himself; but
Himself has all three things, and has them in such way that they
are Him<pb n="206" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_206.html" id="iv.i.xvii.vii-Page_206"/>self. But that He is so comes to Him thence, whence He
proceeds.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.vii-p4">13. What man, then, is there who
can comprehend that wisdom by which God knows all things, in such
wise that neither what we call things past are past therein, nor
what we call things future are therein waited for as coming, as
though they were absent, but both past and future with things
present are all present; nor yet are things thought severally, so
that thought passes from one to another, but all things
simultaneously are at hand in one glance;&#8212;what man, I say, is
there that comprehends that wisdom, and the like prudence, and the
like knowledge, since in truth even our own wisdom is beyond our
comprehension? For somehow we are able to behold the things that
are present to our senses or to our understanding; but the things
that are absent, and yet have once been present, we know by memory,
if we have not forgotten them. And we conjecture, too, not the past
from the future, but the future from the past, yet by all unstable
knowledge. For there are some of our thoughts to which, although
future, we, as it were, look onward with greater plainness and
certainty as being very near; and we do this by the means of memory
when we are able to do it, as much as we ever are able, although
memory seems to belong not to the future, but to the past. And this
may be tried in the case of any words or songs, the due order of
which we are rendering by memory; for we certainly should not utter
each in succession, unless we foresaw in thought what came next.
And yet it is not foresight, but memory, that enables us to foresee
it; for up to the very end of the words or the song, nothing is
uttered except as foreseen and looked forward to. And yet in doing
this, we are not said to speak or sing by foresight, but by memory;
and if any one is more than commonly capable of uttering many
pieces in this way, he is usually praised, not for his foresight,
but for his memory. We know, and are absolutely certain, that all
this takes place in our mind or by our mind; but how it takes
place, the more attentively we desire to scrutinize, the more do
both our very words break down, and our purpose itself fails, when
by our understanding, if not our tongue, we would reach to
something of clearness. And do such as we are, think, that in so
great infirmity of mind we can comprehend whether the foresight of
God is the same as His memory and His understanding, who does not
regard in thought each several thing, but embraces all that He
knows in one eternal and unchangeable and ineffable vision? In this
difficulty, then, and strait, we may well cry out to the living
God, &#8220;Such knowledge is too wonderful for me: it is high, I
cannot attain unto it.&#8221;<note place="end" n="958" id="iv.i.xvii.vii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.vii-p5"> <scripRef passage="Ps. cxxxix. 6" id="iv.i.xvii.vii-p5.2" parsed="|Ps|139|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.139.6">Ps. cxxxix. 6</scripRef></p></note> For I understand by myself how

incorporeal substance, and that it is the light by which those

this &#8220;glass,&#8221; this assuredly occurs to our minds, that in a

so to do; in order that we might see in some way or other by this
image which we are, Him by whom we are made, as by a glass. And
this is intimated also in the words of the same apostle: &#8220;But we
with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are
transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by
the Spirit of the Lord.&#8221;<note place="end" n="962" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p4"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. iii. 18" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p4.2" parsed="|2Cor|3|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.18">2 Cor. iii. 18</scripRef></p></note> &#8220;Beholding as in a glass,&#8221;<note place="end" n="963" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p5"> <i>Speculantes</i></p></note> he has said,
<i>i.e.</i> seeing by means of a glass, not looking from a
watch-tower: an ambiguity that does not exist in the Greek
language, whence the apostolic epistles have been rendered into
Latin. For in Greek, a glass,<note place="end" n="964" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p6"> <i>Speculum</i></p></note> in which the images of things are

watch-tower,<note place="end" n="965" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p7"> <i>Specula</i></p></note> from the
height of which we command a more distant view. And it is quite
plain that the apostle, in using the word &#8220;speculantes&#8221; in
respect to the glory of the Lord, meant it to come from
&#8220;speculum,&#8221; not from &#8220;specula.&#8221; But where he says, &#8220;We
are transformed into the same image,&#8221; he assuredly means to speak
of the image of God; and by calling it &#8220;the same,&#8221; he means
that very image which we see in the glass, because that same image
is also the glory of the Lord; as he says elsewhere, &#8220;For a man
indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image
and glory of God,&#8221;<note place="end" n="966" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p8"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 7" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p8.2" parsed="|1Cor|11|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.7">1 Cor. xi. 7</scripRef></p></note>&#8212;a text already discussed in the
twelfth book. He means, then, by &#8220;We are transformed,&#8221; that we
are changed from one form to another, and that we pass from a form
that is obscure to a form <pb n="207" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_207.html" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-Page_207"/>that is bright: since the
obscure form, too, is the image of God; and if an image, then
assuredly also &#8220;glory,&#8221; in which we are created as men, being
better than the other animals. For it is said of human nature in
itself, &#8220;The man ought not to cover his head, because he is the
image and glory of God.&#8221; And this nature, being the most
excellent among things created, is transformed from a form that is
defaced into a form that is beautiful, when it is justified by its
own Creator from ungodliness. Since even in ungodliness itself, the
more the faultiness is to be condemned, the more certainly is the
nature to be praised. And therefore he has added, &#8220;from glory to
glory:&#8221; from the glory of creation to the glory of justification.
Although these words, &#8220;from glory to glory,&#8221; may be understood
also in other ways;&#8212;from the glory of faith to the glory of
sight, from the glory whereby we are sons of God to the glory
whereby we shall be like Him, because &#8220;we shall see Him as He
is.&#8221;<note place="end" n="967" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p9"> <scripRef passage="1 John iii. 2" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p9.2" parsed="|1John|3|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.3.2">1 John iii. 2</scripRef></p></note> But in that

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p1.1">Chapter 9.&#8212;Of the Term
&#8220;Enigma,&#8221; And of Tropical Modes of Speech.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p2">15. What has been said relates to
the words of the apostle, that &#8220;we see now through a glass;&#8221;
but whereas he has added, &#8220;in an enigma,&#8221; the meaning of this
addition is unknown to any who are unacquainted with the books that
contain the doctrine of those modes of speech, which the Greeks
call Tropes, which Greek word we also use in Latin. For as we more
commonly speak of <i>schemata</i> than of figures, so we more
commonly speak of tropes than of modes. And it is a very difficult
and uncommon thing to express the names of the several modes or
tropes in Latin, so as to refer its appropriate name to each. And
hence some Latin translators, through unwillingness to employ a
Greek word, where the apostle says, &#8220;Which things are an
allegory,&#8221;<note place="end" n="968" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gal. iv. 24" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p3.2" parsed="|Gal|4|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.4.24">Gal. iv. 24</scripRef></p></note> have
rendered it by a circumlocution&#8212;Which things signify one thing by
another. But there are several species of this kind of trope that
is called allegory, and one of them is that which is called enigma.
Now the definition of the generic term must necessarily embrace
also all its species; and hence, as every horse is an animal, but
not every animal is a horse, so every enigma is an allegory, but
every allegory is not an enigma. What then is an allegory, but a
trope wherein one thing is understood from another? as in the
Epistle to the Thessalonians, &#8220;Let us not therefore sleep, as do
others; but let us watch and be sober: for they who sleep, sleep in
the night; and they who are drunken, are drunken in the night: but
let us who are of the day, be sober.&#8221;<note place="end" n="969" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p4"> <scripRef passage="1 Thess. v. 6-8" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p4.2" parsed="|1Thess|5|6|5|8" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.5.6-1Thess.5.8">1 Thess. v. 6&#8211;8</scripRef></p></note> But this allegory is not an enigma.
For here the meaning is patent to all but the very dull; but an
enigma is, to explain it briefly, an obscure allegory, as, <i>
e.g.</i>, &#8220;The horseleech had three daughters,&#8221;<note place="end" n="970" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p5"> <scripRef passage="Prov. xxx. 15" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p5.2" parsed="|Prov|30|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.30.15">Prov. xxx. 15</scripRef></p></note> and other
like instances. But when the apostle spoke of an allegory, he does
not find it in the words, but in the fact; since he has shown that
the two Testaments are to be understood by the two sons of Abraham,
one by a bondmaid, and the other by a free woman, which was a thing
not said, but also done. And before this was explained, it was
obscure; and accordingly such an allegory, which is the generic
name, could be specifically called an enigma.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p6">16. But because it is not only
those that are ignorant of the books that contain the doctrine of
tropes, who inquire the apostle&#8217;s meaning, when he said that we
&#8220;see now in an enigma,&#8221; but those, too, who are acquainted with
the doctrine, but yet desire to know what that enigma is in which
&#8220;we now see;&#8221; we must find a single meaning for the two
phrases, <i>viz</i>. for that which says, &#8220;we see now through a
glass,&#8221; and for that which adds, &#8220;in an enigma.&#8221; For it makes
but one sentence, when the whole is so uttered, &#8220;We see now
through a glass in an enigma.&#8221; Accordingly, as far as my judgment
goes, as by the word glass he meant to signify an image, so by that
of enigma any likeness you will, but yet one obscure, and difficult
to see through. While, therefore, any likenesses whatever may be
understood as signified by the apostle when he speaks of a glass
and an enigma, so that they are adapted to the understanding of
God, in such way as He can be understood; yet nothing is better
adapted to this purpose than that which is not vainly called His
image. Let no one, then, wonder, that we labor to see in any way at
all, even in that fashion of seeing which is granted to us in this
life, <i>viz</i>. through a glass, in an enigma. For we should not
hear of an enigma in this place if sight were easy. And this is a
yet greater enigma, that we do not see what we cannot but see. For
who does not see his own thought? And yet who does see his own
thought, I do not say with the eye of the flesh, but with the inner
sight itself? Who <pb n="208" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_208.html" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-Page_208"/>does not see it, and who does
see it? Since thought is a kind of sight of the mind; whether those
things are present which are seen also by the bodily eyes, or
perceived by the other senses; or whether they are not present, but
their likenesses are discerned by thought; or whether neither of
these is the case, but things are thought of that are neither
bodily things nor likenesses of bodily things, as the virtues and
vices; or as, indeed, thought itself is thought of; or whether it
be those things which are the subjects of instruction and of
liberal sciences; or whether the higher causes and reasons
themselves of all these things in the unchangeable nature are
thought of; or whether it be even evil, and vain, and false things
that we are thinking of, with either the sense not consenting, or

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p2">17. But let us now speak of those
things of which we think as known, and have in our knowledge even
if we do not think of them; whether they belong to the
contemplative knowledge, which, as I have argued, is properly to be
called wisdom, or to the active which is properly to be called
knowledge. For both together belong to one mind, and are one image
of God. But when we treat of the lower of the two distinctly and
separately, then it is not to be called an image of God, although
even then, too, some likeness of that Trinity may be found in it;
as we showed in the thirteenth book. We speak now, therefore, of
the entire knowledge of man altogether, in which whatever is known
to us is known; that, at any rate, which is true; otherwise it
would not be known. For no one knows what is false, except when he
knows it to be false; and if he knows this, then he knows what is
true: for it is true that that is false. We treat, therefore, now
of those things which we think as known, and which are known to us
even if they are not being thought of. But certainly, if we would
utter them in words, we can only do so by thinking them. For
although there were no words spoken, at any rate, he who thinks
speaks in his heart. And hence that passage in the book of Wisdom:
&#8220;They said within themselves, thinking not aright.&#8221;<note place="end" n="971" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p3"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. ii. 1" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p3.2" parsed="|Wis|2|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.2.1">Wisd. ii. 1</scripRef></p></note> For the
words, &#8220;They said within themselves,&#8221; are explained by the
addition of &#8220;thinking.&#8221; A like passage to this is that in the

to the paralytic man, &#8220;Be of good cheer, my son, thy sins are
forgiven thee,&#8221; said within themselves, &#8220;This man
blasphemeth.&#8221; For how did they &#8220;say within themselves,&#8221;
except by thinking? Then follows, &#8220;And when Jesus saw their

is, &#8220;They said, thinking,&#8221; is the same here with, &#8220;They
thought, saying.&#8221; For both there and here it is declared, that
they spake within themselves, and in their own heart, <i>i.e.</i>
spake by thinking. For they &#8220;spake within themselves,&#8221; and it
was said to them, &#8220;What think ye?&#8221; And the Lord Himself says of
that rich man whose ground brought forth plentifully, &#8220;And he
thought within himself, saying.&#8221;<note place="end" n="974" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p6"> <scripRef passage="Luke xii. 17" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p6.2" parsed="|Luke|12|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.12.17">Luke xii. 17</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p7">18. Some thoughts, then, are
speeches of the heart, wherein the Lord also shows that there is a
mouth, when He says, &#8220;Not that which entereth into the mouth
defileth a man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, that
defileth a man.&#8221; In one sentence He has comprised two diverse
mouths of the man, one of the body, one of the heart. For
assuredly, that from which they thought the man to be defiled,
enters into the mouth of the body; but that from which the Lord
said the man was defiled, proceedeth out of the mouth of the heart.
So certainly He Himself explained what He had said. For a little
after, He says also to His disciples concerning the same thing:
&#8220;Are ye also yet without understanding? Do ye not understand,
that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and
is cast out into the draught?&#8221; Here He most certainly pointed to
the mouth of the body. But in that which follows He plainly speaks
of the mouth of the heart, where He says, &#8220;But those things which
proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile
the man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,&#8221;<note place="end" n="975" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p8"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 15.10-20" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p8.1" parsed="|Matt|15|10|15|20" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.10-Matt.15.20">Matt. xv. 10&#8211;20</scripRef></p></note> etc. What is
clearer than this explanation? And yet, when we call thoughts
speeches of the heart, it does not follow that they are not also
acts of sight, arising from the sight of knowledge, when they are
true. For when these things are done outwardly by means of the
body, then speech and sight are different things; but when we think
inwardly, the two <pb n="209" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_209.html" id="iv.i.xvii.x-Page_209"/>are one,&#8212;just as sight and
hearing are two things mutually distinct in the bodily senses, but
to see and hear are the same thing in the mind; and hence, while
speech is not seen but rather heard outwardly, yet the inward
speeches, <i>i.e.</i> thoughts, are said by the holy Gospel to have
been seen, not heard, by the Lord. &#8220;They said within themselves,
This man blasphemeth,&#8221; says the Gospel; and then subjoined,
&#8220;And when Jesus saw their thoughts.&#8221; Therefore He saw, what
they said. For by His own thought He saw their thoughts, which they
supposed no one saw but themselves.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p9">19. Whoever, then, is able to
understand a word, not only before it is uttered in sound, but also
before the images of its sounds are considered in thought,&#8212;for
this it is which belongs to no tongue, to wit, of those which are
called the tongues of nations, of which our Latin tongue is
one;&#8212;whoever, I say, is able to understand this, is able now to
see through this glass and in this enigma some likeness of that
Word of whom it is said, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the
Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221;<note place="end" n="976" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p10"> <scripRef passage="John i. 1" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p10.2" parsed="|John|1|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.1">John i. 1</scripRef></p></note> For of necessity, when we speak
what is true, <i>i.e.</i> speak what we know, there is born from
the knowledge itself which the memory retains, a word that is
altogether of the same kind with that knowledge from which it is
born. For the thought that is formed by the thing which we know, is
the word which we speak in the heart: which word is neither Greek
nor Latin, nor of any other tongue. But when it is needful to
convey this to the knowledge of those to whom we speak, then some
sign is assumed whereby to signify it. And generally a sound,
sometimes a nod, is exhibited, the former to the ears, the latter
to the eyes, that the word which we bear in our mind may become
known also by bodily signs to the bodily senses. For what is to nod
or beckon, except to speak in some way to the sight? And Holy
Scripture gives its testimony to this; for we read in the Gospel
according to John: &#8220;Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of
you shall betray me. Then the disciples looked one upon another,
doubting of whom He spake. Now there was leaning on Jesus&#8217; breast
one of His disciples whom Jesus loved. Simon Peter therefore
beckons to him, and says to him, Who is it of whom He speaks?&#8221;<note place="end" n="977" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p10.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p11"> <scripRef passage="John xiii. 21-24" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p11.2" parsed="|John|13|21|13|24" osisRef="Bible:John.13.21-John.13.24">John xiii. 21&#8211;24</scripRef></p></note> Here he
spoke by beckoning what he did not venture to speak by sounds. But
whereas we exhibit these and the like bodily signs either to ears
or eyes of persons present to whom we speak, letters have been
invented that we might be able to converse also with the absent;
but these are signs of words, as words themselves are signs in our
conversation of those things which we think.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xi-p2">20. Accordingly, the word that
sounds outwardly is the sign of the word that gives light inwardly;
which latter has the greater claim to be called a word. For that
which is uttered with the mouth of the flesh, is the articulate
sound of a word; and is itself also called a word, on account of
that to make which outwardly apparent it is itself assumed. For our
word is so made in some way into an articulate sound of the body,
by assuming that articulate sound by which it may be manifested to
men&#8217;s senses, as the Word of God was made flesh, by assuming that
flesh in which itself also might be manifested to men&#8217;s senses.
And as our word becomes an articulate sound, yet is not changed
into one; so the Word of God became flesh, but far be it from us to
say He was changed into flesh. For both that word of ours became an
articulate sound, and that other Word became flesh, by assuming it,
not by consuming itself so as to be changed into it. And therefore
whoever desires to arrive at any likeness, be it of what sort it
may, of the Word of God, however in many respects unlike, must not
regard the word of ours that sounds in the ears, either when it is
uttered in an articulate sound or when it is silently thought. For
the words of all tongues that are uttered in sound are also
silently thought, and the mind runs over verses while the bodily
mouth is silent. And not only the numbers of syllables, but the
tunes also of songs, since they are corporeal, and pertain to that
sense of the body which is called hearing, are at hand by certain
incorporeal images appropriate to them, to those who think of them,
and who silently revolve all these things. But we must pass by
this, in order to arrive at that word of man, by the likeness of
which, be it of what sort it may, the Word of God may be somehow
seen as in an enigma. Not that word which was spoken to this or
that prophet, and of which it is said, &#8220;Now the word of God grew
and multiplied;&#8221;<note place="end" n="978" id="iv.i.xvii.xi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xi-p3"> <scripRef passage="Acts vi. 7" id="iv.i.xvii.xi-p3.2" parsed="|Acts|6|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.6.7">Acts vi. 7</scripRef></p></note> and again, &#8220;Faith then cometh by

is therefore called the word of God, because the doctrine that is
delivered is not human, but divine);&#8212;but we are now seeking to
see, in whatsoever way we can, by means of this likeness, that Word
of God of which it is said, &#8220;The Word was God;&#8221; of which it is
said, &#8220;All things were made by Him;&#8221; of which it is said,
&#8220;The Word became flesh;&#8221; of which it is said &#8220;The Word of God

of man, to the word of the rational animal, to the word of that
image of God, that is not born of God, but made by God; which is
neither utterable in sound nor capable of being thought under the
likeness of sound such as must needs be with the word of any
tongue; but which precedes all the signs by which it is signified,
and is begotten from the knowledge that continues in the mind, when
that same knowledge is spoken inwardly according as it really is.
For the sight of thinking is exceedingly like the sight of
knowledge. For when it is uttered by sound, or by any bodily sign,
it is not uttered according as it really is, but as it can be seen
or heard by the body. When, therefore, that is in the word which is
in the knowledge, then there is a true word, and truth, such as is
looked for from man; such that what is in the knowledge is also in
the word, and what is not in the knowledge is also not in the word.
Here may be recognized, &#8220;Yea, yea; nay, nay.&#8221;<note place="end" n="982" id="iv.i.xvii.xi-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xi-p7"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 5.37" id="iv.i.xvii.xi-p7.1" parsed="|Matt|5|37|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.37">Matt. v. 37</scripRef></p></note> And so this likeness of the image
that is made, approaches as nearly as is possible to that likeness
of the image that is born, by which God the Son is declared to be
in all things like in substance to the Father. We must notice in
this enigma also another likeness of the word of God; <i>viz</i>.
that, as it is said of that Word, &#8220;All things were made by
Him,&#8221; where God is declared to have made the universe by His
only-begotten Son, so there are no works of man that are not first
spoken in his heart: whence it is written, &#8220;A word is the
beginning of every work.&#8221;<note place="end" n="983" id="iv.i.xvii.xi-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xi-p8"> <scripRef passage="Ecclus. xxxvii. 20" id="iv.i.xvii.xi-p8.2" parsed="|Sir|37|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.37.20">Ecclus. xxxvii. 20</scripRef></p></note> But here also, it is when the word
is true, that then it is the beginning of a good work. And a word
is true when it is begotten from the knowledge of working good
works, so that there too may be preserved the &#8220;yea yea, nay
nay;&#8221; in order that whatever is in that knowledge by which we are
to live, may be also in the word by which we are to work, and
whatever is not in the one may not be in the other. Otherwise such
a word will be a lie, not truth; and what comes thence will be a
sin, and not a good work. There is yet this other likeness of the
Word of God in this likeness of our word, that there can be a word
of ours with no work following it, but there cannot be any work
unless a word precedes; just as the Word of God could have existed
though no creature existed, but no creature could exist unless by
that Word by which all things are made. And therefore not God the
Father, not the Holy Spirit, not the Trinity itself, but the Son
only, which is the Word of God, was made flesh; although the
Trinity was the maker: in order that we might live rightly through
our word following and imitating His example, <i>i.e.</i> by having
no lie in either the thought or the work of our word. But this
perfection of this image is one to be at some time hereafter. In
order to attain this it is that the good master teaches us by
Christian faith, and by pious doctrine, that &#8220;with face
unveiled&#8221; from the veil of the law, which is the shadow of things
to come, &#8220;beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,&#8221; <i>
i.e.</i> gazing at it through a glass, &#8220;we may be transformed

is the very knowledge itself that a man can attain, be he ever so
skillful and learned, by which our thought is formed with truth,
when we speak what we know? For to pass by those things that come
into the mind from the bodily senses, among which so many are
otherwise than they seem to be, that he who is overmuch pressed
down by their resemblance to truth, seems sane to himself, but
really is not <pb n="211" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_211.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xii-Page_211"/>sane;&#8212;whence it is that the

his immediate disciples, who were anti-skeptical; but the new
Academy, to which Augustin has previously referred (XIV. xix. 26).
This was skeptical&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> philosophy
has so prevailed as to be still more wretchedly insane by doubting
all things;&#8212;passing by, then, those things that come into the
mind by the bodily senses, how large a proportion is left of things
which we know in such manner as we know that we live? In regard to
this, indeed, we are absolutely without any fear lest perchance we
are being deceived by some resemblance of the truth; since it is
certain, that he who is deceived, yet lives. And this again is not
reckoned among those objects of sight that are presented from
without, so that the eye may be deceived in it; in such way as it
is when an oar in the water looks bent, and towers seem to move as
you sail past them, and a thousand other things that are otherwise
than they seem to be: for this is not a thing that is discerned by
the eye of the flesh. The knowledge by which we know that we live
is the most inward of all knowledge, of which even the Academic
cannot insinuate: Perhaps you are asleep, and do not know it, and
you see things in your sleep. For who does not know that what
people see in dreams is precisely like what they see when awake?
But he who is certain of the knowledge of his own life, does not
therein say, I know I am awake, but, I know I am alive; therefore,
whether he be asleep or awake, he is alive. Nor can he be deceived
in that knowledge by dreams; since it belongs to a living man both
to sleep and to see in sleep. Nor can the Academic again say, in
confutation of this knowledge: Perhaps you are mad, and do not know
it: for what madmen see is precisely like what they also see who
are sane; but he who is mad is alive. Nor does he answer the
Academic by saying, I know I am not mad, but, I know I am alive.
Therefore he who says he knows he is alive, can neither be deceived
nor lie. Let a thousand kinds, then, of deceitful objects of sight
be presented to him who says, I know I am alive; yet he will fear
none of them, for he who is deceived yet is alive. But if such
things alone pertain to human knowledge, they are very few indeed;
unless that they can be so multiplied in each kind, as not only not
to be few, but to reach in the result to infinity. For he who says,
I know I am alive, says that he knows one single thing. Further, if
he says, I know that I know I am alive, now there are two; but that
he knows these two is a third thing to know. And so he can add a
fourth and a fifth, and innumerable others, if he holds out. But
since he cannot either comprehend an innumerable number by
additions of units, or say a thing innumerable times, he
comprehends this at least, and with perfect certainty, <i>viz</i>.
that this is both true and so innumerable that he cannot truly
comprehend and say its infinite number. This same thing may be
noticed also in the case of a will that is certain. For it would be
an impudent answer to make to any one who should say, I will to be
happy, that perhaps you are deceived. And if he should say, I know
that I will this, and I know that I know it, he can add yet a third
to these two, <i>viz</i>. that he knows these two; and a fourth,
that he knows that he knows these two; and so on <i>ad
infinitum</i>. Likewise, if any one were to say, I will not to be
mistaken; will it not be true, whether he is mistaken or whether he
is not, that nevertheless he does will not to be mistaken? Would it
not be most impudent to say to him, Perhaps you are deceived? when
beyond doubt, whereinsoever he may be deceived, he is nevertheless
not deceived in thinking that he wills not to be deceived. And if
he says he knows this, he adds any number he chooses of things
known, and perceives that number to be infinite. For he who says, I
will not to be deceived, and I know that I will not to be so, and I
know that I know it, is able now to set forth an infinite number
here also, however awkward may be the expression of it. And other
things too are to be found capable of refuting the Academics, who
contend that man can know nothing. But we must restrict ourselves,
especially as this is not the subject we have undertaken in the
present work. There are three books of ours on that subject,<note place="end" n="988" id="iv.i.xvii.xii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xii-p4"> <i>Libri Tres contra
Academicos</i></p></note> written in
the early time of our conversion, which he who can and will read,
and who understands them, will doubtless not be much moved by any
of the many arguments which they have found out against the
discovery of truth. For whereas there are two kinds of knowable
things,&#8212;one, of those things which the mind perceives by the
bodily senses; the other, of those which it perceives by
itself,&#8212;these philosophers have babbled much against the bodily
senses, but have never been able to throw doubt upon those most
certain perceptions of things true, which the mind knows by itself,
such as is that which I have mentioned, I know that I am alive. But
far be it from us to doubt the truth of what we have learned by the
bodily senses; since by them we have learned to know the heaven and
the earth, and those things in them which are known to us, so
far <pb n="212" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_212.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xii-Page_212"/>as He who created both us and them has willed them to be
within our knowledge. Far be it from us too to deny, that we know
what we have learned by the testimony of others: otherwise we know
not that there is an ocean; we know not that the lands and cities
exist which most copious report commends to us; we know not that
those men were, and their works, which we have learned by reading
history; we know not the news that is daily brought us from this
quarter or that, and confirmed by consistent and conspiring
evidence; lastly, we know not at what place or from whom we have
been born: since in all these things we have believed the testimony
of others. And if it is most absurd to say this, then we must
confess, that not only our own senses, but those of other persons
also, have added very much indeed to our knowledge.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xii-p5">22. All these things, then, both
those which the human mind knows by itself, and those which it
knows by the bodily senses, and those which it has received and
knows by the testimony of others, are laid up and retained in the
storehouse of the memory; and from these is begotten a word that is
true when we speak what we know, but a word that is before all
sound, before all thought of a sound. For the word is then most
like to the thing known, from which also its image is begotten,
since the sight of thinking arises from the sight of knowledge;
when it is a word belonging to no tongue, but is a true word
concerning a true thing, having nothing of its own, but wholly
derived from that knowledge from which it is born. Nor does it
signify when he learned it, who speaks what he knows; for sometimes
he says it immediately upon learning it; provided only that the
word is true, <i>i.e.</i> sprung from things that are
known.</p>

of the Difference Between the Knowledge and Word of Our Mind, and

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xiii-p2">But is it so, that God the Father,
from whom is born the Word that is God of God,&#8212;is it so, then,
that God the Father, in respect to that wisdom which He is to
Himself, has learned some things by His bodily senses, and others
by Himself? Who could say this, who thinks of God, not as a
rational animal, but as One above the rational soul? So far at
least as He can be thought of, by those who place Him above all
animals and all souls, although they see Him by conjecture through
a glass and in an enigma, not yet face to face as He is. Is it that
God the Father has learned those very things which He knows, not by
the body, for He has none, but by Himself, from elsewhere from some
one? or has stood in need of messengers or witnesses that He might
know them? Certainly not; since His own perfection enables Him to
know all things that He knows. No doubt He has messengers, <i>
viz</i>. the angels; but not to announce to Him things that He
knows not, for there is nothing He does not know. But their good
lies in consulting the truth about their own works. And this it is
which is meant by saying that they bring Him word of some things,
not that He may learn of them, but they of Him by His word without
bodily sound. They bring Him word, too, of that which He wills,
being sent by Him to whomever He wills, and hearing all from Him by
that word of His, <i>i.e.</i> finding in His truth what themselves
are to do: what, to whom, and when, they are to bring word. For we
too pray to Him, yet do not inform Him what our necessities are.
&#8220;For your Father knoweth,&#8221; says His Word, &#8220;what things ye
have need of, before you ask Him.&#8221;<note place="end" n="989" id="iv.i.xvii.xiii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xiii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 6.8" id="iv.i.xvii.xiii-p3.1" parsed="|Matt|6|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.8">Matt. vi. 8</scripRef></p></note> Nor did He become acquainted with
them, so as to know them, at any definite time; but He knew
beforehand, without any beginning, all things to come in time, and
among them also both what we should ask of Him, and when; and to
whom He would either listen or not listen, and on what subjects.
And with respect to all His creatures, both spiritual and
corporeal, He does not know them because they are, but they are
because He knows them. For He was not ignorant of what He was about
to create; therefore He created because He knew; He did not know
because He created. Nor did He know them when created in any other
way than He knew them when still to be created, for nothing accrued
to His wisdom from them; but that wisdom remained as it was, while
they came into existence as it was fitting and when it was fitting.
So, too, it is written in the book of Ecclesiasticus: &#8220;All things
are known to Him ere ever they were created: so also after they
were perfected.&#8221;<note place="end" n="990" id="iv.i.xvii.xiii-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xiii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Ecclus. xxiii. 20" id="iv.i.xvii.xiii-p4.2" parsed="|Sir|23|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.23.20">Ecclus. xxiii. 20</scripRef></p></note> &#8220;So,&#8221; he says, not otherwise;
so were they known to Him, both ere ever they were created, and
after they were perfected. This knowledge, therefore, is far unlike
our knowledge. And the knowledge of God is itself also His wisdom,
and His wisdom is itself His essence or substance. Because in the
marvellous simplicity of that nature, it is not one thing to be
wise and another to be, but to be wise is to be; as we have often
said already also in the earlier books. But our knowledge is in
most things <pb n="213" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_213.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xiii-Page_213"/>capable both of being lost and
of being recovered, because to us to be is not the same as to know
or to be wise; since it is possible for us to be, even although we
know not, neither are wise in that which we have learned from
elsewhere. Therefore, as our knowledge is unlike that knowledge of
God, so is our word also, which is born from our knowledge, unlike
that Word of God which is born from the essence of the Father. And
this is as if I should say, born from the Father&#8217;s knowledge,
from the Father&#8217;s wisdom; or still more exactly, from the Father
who is knowledge, from the Father who is wisdom.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xiv-p2">23. The Word of God, then, the
only-begotten Son of the Father, in all things like and equal to
the Father, God of God, Light of Light, Wisdom of Wisdom, Essence
of Essence, is altogether that which the Father is, yet is not the
Father, because the one is Son, the other is Father. And hence He
knows all that the Father knows; but to Him to know, as to be, is
from the Father, for to know and to be is there one. And therefore,
as to be is not to the Father from the Son, so neither is to know.
Accordingly, as though uttering Himself, the Father begat the Word
equal to Himself in all things; for He would not have uttered
Himself wholly and perfectly, if there were in His Word anything
more or less than in Himself. And here that is recognized in the
highest sense, &#8220;Yea, yea; nay, nay.&#8221;<note place="end" n="991" id="iv.i.xvii.xiv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xiv-p3"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 5.37" id="iv.i.xvii.xiv-p3.1" parsed="|Matt|5|37|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.37">Matt. v. 37</scripRef></p></note> And therefore this Word is truly
truth, since whatever is in that knowledge from which it is born is
also in itself and whatever is not in that knowledge is not in the
Word. And this Word can never have anything false, because it is
unchangeable, as He is from whom it is. For &#8220;the Son can do
nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do.&#8221;<note place="end" n="992" id="iv.i.xvii.xiv-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xiv-p4"> <scripRef passage="John v. 19" id="iv.i.xvii.xiv-p4.2" parsed="|John|5|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.19">John v. 19</scripRef></p></note> Through
power He cannot do this; nor is it infirmity, but strength, by
which truth cannot be false. Therefore God the Father knows all
things in Himself, knows all things in the Son; but in Himself as
though Himself, in the Son as though His own Word which Word is
spoken concerning all those things that are in Himself. Similarly
the Son knows all things, <i>viz</i>. in Himself, as things which
are born of those which the Father knows in Himself, and in the
Father, as those of which they are born, which the Son Himself
knows in Himself. The Father then, and the Son know mutually; but
the one by begetting, the other by being born. And each of them
sees simultaneously all things that are in their knowledge, in
their wisdom, in their essence: not by parts or singly, as though
by alternately looking from this side to that, and from that side
to this, and again from this or that object to this or that object,
so as not to be able to see some things without at the same time
not seeing others; but, as I said, sees all things simultaneously,
whereof there is not one that He does not always see.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xiv-p5">24. And that word, then, of ours
which has neither sound nor thought of sound, but is of that thing
in seeing which we speak inwardly, and which therefore belongs to
no tongue; and hence is in some sort like, in this enigma, to that
Word of God which is also God; since this too is born of our
knowledge, in such manner as that also is born of the knowledge of
the Father: such a word, I say, of ours, which we find to be in
some way like that Word, let us not be slow to consider how unlike
also it is, as it may be in our power to utter it.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xv-p2">Is our word, then, born of our
knowledge only? Do we not say many things also that we do not know?
And say them not with doubt, but thinking them to be true; while if
perchance they are true in respect to the things themselves of
which we speak, they are yet not true in respect to our word,
because a word is not true unless it is born of a thing that is
known. In this sense, then, our word is false, not when we lie, but
when we are deceived. And when we doubt, our word is not yet of the
thing of which we doubt, but it is a word concerning the doubt
itself. For although we do not know whether that is true of which
we doubt, yet we do know that we doubt; and hence, when we say we
doubt, we say a word that is true, for we say what we know. And
what, too, of its being possible for us to lie? And when we do,
certainly we both willingly and knowingly have a word that is
false, wherein there is a word that is true, <i>viz</i>. that we
lie, for this we know. And when we confess that we have lied, we
speak that which is true; for we say what we know, for we know that
we lied. But that Word which is God, and can do more than we,
cannot do this. For it &#8220;can do nothing except what it sees the
Father do;&#8221; and it &#8220;speaks not of itself,&#8221; but it has from
the Father all that it <pb n="214" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_214.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xv-Page_214"/>speaks, since the Father speaks
it in a special way; and the great might of that Word is that it
cannot lie, because there cannot be there &#8220;yea and nay,&#8221;<note place="end" n="993" id="iv.i.xvii.xv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xv-p3"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. i. 19" id="iv.i.xvii.xv-p3.2" parsed="|2Cor|1|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.19">2 Cor. i. 19</scripRef></p></note> but &#8220;yea
yea, nay nay.&#8221; Well, but that is not even to be called a word,
which is not true. I willingly assent, if so it be. What, then, if
our word is true and therefore is rightly called a word? Is it the
case that, as we can speak of sight of sight, and knowledge of
knowledge, so we can speak of essence of essence, as that Word of
God is especially spoken of, and is especially to be spoken of? Why
so? Because to us, to be is not the same as to know; since we know
many things which in some sense live by memory, and so in some
sense die by being forgotten: and so, when those things are no
longer in our knowledge, yet we still are: and while our knowledge
has slipped away and perished out of our mind, we are still
alive.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xv-p4">25. In respect to those things also
which are so known that they can never escape the memory, because
they are present, and belong to the nature of the mind
itself,&#8212;as, <i>e.g.</i>, the knowing that we are alive (for this
continues so long as the mind continues; and because the mind
continues always, this also continues always);&#8212;I say, in respect
to this and to any other like instances, in which we are the rather
to contemplate the image of God, it is difficult to make out in
what way, although they are always known, yet because they are not
always also thought of, an eternal word can be spoken respecting
them, when our word is spoken in our thought. For it is eternal to
the soul to live; it is eternal to know that it lives. Yet it is
not eternal to it to be thinking of its own life, or to be thinking
of its own knowledge of its own life; since, in entering upon this
or that occupation, it will cease to think of this, although it
does not cease from knowing it. And hence it comes to pass, that if
there can be in the mind any knowledge that is eternal, while the
thought of that knowledge cannot be eternal, and any inner and true
word of ours is only said by our thought, then God alone can be
understood to have a Word that is eternal, and co-eternal with
Himself. Unless, perhaps, we are to say that the very possibility
of thought&#8212;since that which is known is capable of being truly
thought, even at the time when it is not being
thought&#8212;constitutes a word as perpetual as the knowledge itself
is perpetual. But how is that a word which is not yet formed in the
vision of the thought? How will it be like the knowledge of which
it is born, if it has not the form of that knowledge, and is only
now called a word because it can have it? For it is much as if one
were to say that a word is to be so called because it can be a
word. But what is this that can be a word, and is therefore already
held worthy of the name of a word? What, I say, is this thing that
is formable, but not yet formed, except a something in our mind,
which we toss to and fro by revolving it this way or that, while we
think of first one thing and then another, according as they are
found by or occur to us? And the true word then comes into being,
when, as I said, that which we toss to and fro by revolving it
arrives at that which we know, and is formed by that, in taking its
entire likeness; so that in what manner each thing is known, in
that manner also it is thought, <i>i.e.</i> is said in this manner
in the heart, without articulate sound, without thought of
articulate sound, such as no doubt belongs to some particular
tongue. And hence if we even admit, in order not to dispute
laboriously about a name, that this something of our mind, which
can be formed from our knowledge, is to be already called a word,
even before it is so formed, because it is, so to say, already
formable, who would not see how great would be the unlikeness
between it and that Word of God, which is so in the form of God, as
not to have been formable before it was formed, or to have been
capable at any time of being formless, but is a simple form, and
simply equal to Him from whom it is, and with whom it is
wonderfully co-eternal?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-p2">Wherefore that Word of God is in
such wise so called, as not to be called a thought of God, lest we
believe that there is anything in God which can be revolved, so
that it at one time receives and at another recovers a form, so as
to be a word, and again can lose that form and be revolved in some
sense formlessly. Certainly that excellent master of speech knew
well the force of words, and had looked into the nature of thought,
who said in his poem, &#8220;And revolves with himself the varying
issues of war,&#8221;<note place="end" n="994" id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-p3"> <i>&#198;n</i>. x. 159, 160.</p></note> <i>i.e.</i>
thinks of them. That Son of God, then, is not called the Thought of
God, but the Word of God. For our own thought, attaining to what we
know, and formed thereby, is our true word. And so the Word of God
ought to be understood without any thought on the part of God, so
that it be understood as the simple <pb n="215" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_215.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-Page_215"/>form itself, but containing
nothing formable that can be also unformed. There are, indeed,
passages of Holy Scripture that speak of God&#8217;s thoughts; but this
is after the same mode of speech by which the forgetfulness of God
is also there spoken of, whereas in strict propriety of language
there is in Him certainly no forgetfulness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-p4">26. Wherefore, since we have found
now in this enigma so great an unlikeness to God and the Word of

must be admitted, that even when we shall be like Him, when &#8220;we
shall see Him as He is&#8221;<note place="end" n="995" id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 John iii. 2" id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-p5.2" parsed="|1John|3|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.3.2">1 John iii. 2</scripRef></p></note> (and certainly he who said this was
aware beyond doubt of our present unlikeness), not even then shall
we be equal to Him in nature. For that nature which is made is ever
less than that which makes. And at that time our word will not
indeed be false, because we shall neither lie nor be deceived.
Perhaps, too, our thoughts will no longer revolve by passing and
repassing from one thing to another, but we shall see all our
knowledge at once, and at one glance. Still, when even this shall
have come to pass, if indeed it shall come to pass, the creature
which was formable will indeed have been formed, so that nothing
will be wanting of that form to which it ought to attain; yet
nevertheless it will not be to be equalled to that simplicity
wherein there is not anything formable, which has been formed or
reformed, but only form; and which being neither formless nor
formed, itself is eternal and unchangeable substance.</p>

the Father and of the Son, so far as was possible for us to see

Holy Spirit, so far as by God&#8217;s gift it is permitted to see Him.
And the Holy Spirit, according to the Holy Scriptures, is neither
of the Father alone, nor of the Son alone, but of both; and so
intimates to us a mutual love, wherewith the Father and the Son
reciprocally love one another. But the language of the Word of God,
in order to exercise us, has caused those things to be sought into
with the greater zeal, which do not lie on the surface, but are to
be scrutinized in hidden depths, and to be drawn out from thence.
The Scriptures, accordingly, have not said, The Holy Spirit is
Love. If they had said so, they would have done away with no small
part of this inquiry.

is uncertain and remains to be inquired whether God the Father is
love, or God the Son, or God the Holy Ghost, or the Trinity itself
which is God. For we are not going to say that God is called Love

but the question is, whether the Father, or the Son, or the Holy
Spirit, or the Trinity itself: because the Trinity is not three
Gods, but one God. But I have already argued above in this book,
that the Trinity, which is God, is not so to be understood from
those three things which have been set forth in the trinity of our
mind, as that the Father should be the memory of all three, and the
Son the understanding of all three, and the Holy Spirit the love of
all three; as though the Father should neither understand nor love
for Himself, but the Son should understand for Him, and the Holy
Spirit love for Him, but He Himself should remember only both for
Himself and for them; nor the Son remember nor love for Himself,
but the Father should remember for Him, and the Holy Spirit love
for Him, but He Himself understand only both for Himself and them;
nor likewise that the Holy Spirit should neither remember nor
understand for Himself, but the Father should remember for Him, and
the Son understand for Him, while He Himself should love only both
for Himself and for them; but rather in this way, that both all and
each have all three each in His own nature. Nor that these things
should differ in them, as in us memory is one thing, understanding
another, love or charity another, but should be some one thing that
is <pb n="216" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_216.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-Page_216"/>equivalent to all, as wisdom itself; and should be so
contained in the nature of each, as that He who has it is that
which He has, as being an unchangeable and simple substance. If all
this, then, has been understood, and so far as is granted to us to
see or conjecture in things so great, has been made patently true,
I know not why both the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit
should not be called Love, and all together one love, just as both
the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit is called Wisdom, and
all together not three, but one wisdom. For so also both the Father
is God, and the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God, and all three
together one God.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p10">29. And yet it is not to no purpose
that in this Trinity the Son and none other is called the Word of
God, and the Holy Spirit and none other the Gift of God, and God
the Father alone is He from whom the Word is born, and from whom
the Holy Spirit principally proceeds. And therefore I have added
the word principally, because we find that the Holy Spirit proceeds
from the Son also. But the Father gave Him this too, not as to one
already existing, and not yet having it; but whatever He gave to
the only-begotten Word, He gave by begetting Him. Therefore He so
begat Him as that the common Gift should proceed from Him also, and
the Holy Spirit should be the Spirit of both. This distinction,
then, of the inseparable Trinity is not to be merely accepted in
passing, but to be carefully considered; for hence it was that the
Word of God was specially called also the Wisdom of God, although
both Father and Holy Spirit are wisdom. If, then, any one of the
three is to be specially called Love, what more fitting than that
it should be the Holy Spirit?&#8212;namely, that in that simple and
highest nature, substance should not be one thing and love another,
but that substance itself should be love, and love itself should be
substance, whether in the Father, or in the Son, or in the Holy
Spirit; and yet that the Holy Spirit should be specially called
Love.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p11">30. Just as sometimes all the
utterances of the Old Testament together in the Holy Scriptures are
signified by the name of the Law. For the apostle, in citing a text
from the prophet Isaiah, where he says, &#8220;With divers tongues and
with divers lips will I speak to this people,&#8221; yet prefaced it
by, &#8220;It is written in the Law.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1002" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p12"> <scripRef passage="Isa. xxviii. 11" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p12.2" parsed="|Isa|28|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.28.11">Isa. xxviii. 11</scripRef> and

by Moses is specially called the Law: as it is said, &#8220;The Law and
the Prophets were until John;&#8221;<note place="end" n="1005" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p14.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p15"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 11.13" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p15.1" parsed="|Matt|11|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.13">Matt. xi. 13</scripRef></p></note> and, &#8220;On these two commandments
hang all the Law and the Prophets.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1006" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p16"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 22.40" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p16.1" parsed="|Matt|22|40|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.40">Matt. xxii. 40</scripRef></p></note> Here, certainly, that is specially
called the Law which was from Mount Sinai. And the Psalms, too, are
signified under the name of the Prophets; and yet in another place
the Saviour Himself says, &#8220;All things must needs be fulfilled,
which are written in the Law, and the Prophets, and the Psalms
concerning me.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1007" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p17"> <scripRef passage="Luke xxiv. 44" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p17.2" parsed="|Luke|24|44|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.24.44">Luke xxiv. 44</scripRef></p></note> Here, on the other side, He meant
the name of Prophets to be taken as not including the Psalms.
Therefore the Law with the Prophets and the Psalms taken together
is called the Law universally, and the Law is also specially so
called which was given by Moses. Likewise the Prophets are so
called in common together with the Psalms, and they are also
specially so called exclusive of the Psalms. And many other
instances might be adduced to teach us, that many names of things
are both put universally, and also specially applied to particular
things, were it not that a long discourse is to be avoided in a
plain case. I have said so much, lest any one should think that it
was therefore unsuitable for us to call the Holy Spirit Love,
because both God the Father and God the Son can be called
Love.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p18">31. As, then, we call the only Word
of God specially by the name of Wisdom, although universally both
the Holy Spirit and the Father Himself is wisdom; so the Holy
Spirit is specially called by the name of Love, although
universally both the Father and the Son are love. But the Word of
God, <i>i.e.</i> the only-begotten Son of God, is expressly called
the Wisdom of God by the mouth of the apostle, where he says,
&#8220;Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1008" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p19"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 24" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p19.2" parsed="|1Cor|1|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.24">1 Cor. i. 24</scripRef></p></note> But where
the Holy Spirit is called Love, is to be found by careful scrutiny
of the language of John the apostle, who, after saying, &#8220;Beloved,
let us love one another, for love is of God,&#8221; has gone on to say,
&#8220;And every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He
that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.&#8221; Here,
manifestly, he has called that love God, which he said was of God;
therefore God of God is love. But because both the Son is born of
God the Father, and the Holy Spirit proceeds from God the Father,
it is rightly asked which of them we ought here to think is the
rather called the love that is God. For the Father only is so God
as not to be of God; and hence the love that is so God as to be of
God, is either the Son or the Holy Spirit. But when, in what
<pb n="217" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_217.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-Page_217"/>follows, the apostle had mentioned the love of God, not
that by which we love Him, but that by which He &#8220;loved us, and
sent His Son to be a propitiator for our sins,&#8221;<note place="end" n="1009" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p19.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p20"> <scripRef passage="1 John iv. 10" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p20.2" parsed="|1John|4|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.4.10">1 John iv. 10</scripRef></p></note> and
thereupon had exhorted us also to love one another, and that so God
would abide in us,&#8212;because, namely, he had called God Love;
immediately, in his wish to speak yet more expressly on the
subject, &#8220;Hereby,&#8221; he says, &#8220;know we that we dwell in Him,
and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit.&#8221; Therefore
the Holy Spirit, of whom He hath given us, makes us to abide in
God, and Him in us; and this it is that love does. Therefore He is
the God that is love. Lastly, a little after, when he had repeated
the same thing, and had said &#8220;God is love,&#8221; he immediately
subjoined, &#8220;And he who abideth in love, abideth in God, and God
abideth in him;&#8221; whence he had said above, &#8220;Hereby we know that
we abide in Him, and He in us, because He hath given us of His
Spirit.&#8221; He therefore is signified, where we read that God is
love. Therefore God the Holy Spirit, who proceedeth from the
Father, when He has been given to man, inflames him to the love of
God and of his neighbor, and is Himself love. For man has not
whence to love God, unless from God; and therefore he says a little
after, &#8220;Let us love Him, because He first loved us.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1010" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p20.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p21"> <scripRef passage="1 John iv. 7-19" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p21.2" parsed="|1John|4|7|4|19" osisRef="Bible:1John.4.7-1John.4.19">1 John iv. 7&#8211;19</scripRef></p></note> The

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xviii-p2">32. There is no gift of God more
excellent than this. It alone distinguishes the sons of the eternal
kingdom and the sons of eternal perdition. Other gifts, too, are
given by the Holy Spirit; but without love they profit nothing.
Unless, therefore, the Holy Spirit is so far imparted to each, as
to make him one who loves God and his neighbor, he is not removed
from the left hand to the right. Nor is the Spirit specially called
the Gift, unless on account of love. And he who has not this love,
&#8220;though he speak with the tongues of men and angels, is sounding
brass and a tinkling cymbal; and though he have the gift of
prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and though he
have all faith, so that he can remove mountains, he is nothing; and
though he bestow all his goods to feed the poor, and though he give
his body to be burned, it profiteth him nothing.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1012" id="iv.i.xvii.xviii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xviii-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiii. 1-3" id="iv.i.xvii.xviii-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|13|1|13|3" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.1-1Cor.13.3">1 Cor. xiii. 1&#8211;3</scripRef></p></note> How great
a good, then, is that without which goods so great bring no one to
eternal life! But love or charity itself,&#8212;for they are two names
for one thing,&#8212;if he have it that does not speak with tongues,
nor has the gift of prophecy, nor knows all mysteries and all
knowledge, nor gives all his goods to the poor, either because he
has none to give or because some necessity hinders, nor delivers
his body to be burned, if no trial of such a suffering overtakes
him, brings that man to the kingdom, so that faith itself is only
rendered profitable by love, since faith without love can indeed
exist, but cannot profit. And therefore also the Apostle Paul says,
&#8220;In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor
uncircumcision, but faith that worketh by love:&#8221;<note place="end" n="1013" id="iv.i.xvii.xviii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xviii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Gal. v. 6" id="iv.i.xvii.xviii-p4.2" parsed="|Gal|5|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.5.6">Gal. v. 6</scripRef></p></note> so

and is God, is specially the Holy Spirit, by whom the love of God
is shed abroad in our hearts, by which love the whole Trinity
dwells in us. And therefore most rightly is the Holy Spirit,

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p2">33. Is this too to be proved, that
the Holy Spirit is called in the sacred books the gift of God? If
people look for this too, we have in the Gospel according to John
the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, who says, &#8220;If any one thirst,
let him come to me and drink: he that believeth on me, as the
Scripture saith, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
water.&#8221; And the evangelist has gone on further to add, &#8220;And

in Him.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1016" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p3"> <scripRef passage="John vii. 37-39" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p3.2" parsed="|John|7|37|7|39" osisRef="Bible:John.7.37-John.7.39">John vii. 37&#8211;39</scripRef></p></note> And hence

water is called the gift of God which is the Holy Spirit. But as we
find here that this water is the Holy Spirit, so we find elsewhere
in the Gospel itself that this water is called the gift of God. For
when the same Lord was talking with the woman of Samaria at the
well, to whom He had said, &#8220;Give me 
<pb n="218" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_218.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-Page_218"/>to drink,&#8221; and she had
answered that the Jews &#8220;have no dealings&#8221; with the Samaritans,
Jesus answered and said unto her, &#8220;If thou hadst known the gift
of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou
wouldest have asked of Him, and He would have given thee living
water. The woman saith unto Him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw
with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou this living
water, etc.? Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that
drinketh of this water shall thirst again; but whose shall drink of
the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water
that I shall give him, shall be in him a fountain of water
springing up unto eternal life.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1018" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p5"> <scripRef passage="John iv. 7-14" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p5.2" parsed="|John|4|7|4|14" osisRef="Bible:John.4.7-John.4.14">John iv. 7&#8211;14</scripRef></p></note> Because this living water, then,
as the evangelist has explained to us, is the Holy Spirit, without
doubt the Spirit is the gift of God, of which the Lord says here,
&#8220;If thou hadst known the gift of God, and who it is that saith
unto thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of Him, and
He would have given thee living water.&#8221; For that which is in the
one passage, &#8220;Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
water,&#8221; is in the other, &#8220;shall be in him a fountain of water
springing up unto eternal life.&#8221;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p6">34. Paul the apostle also says,
&#8220;To each of us is given grace according to the measure of the
gift of Christ;&#8221; and then, that he might show that by the gift of
Christ he meant the Holy Spirit, he has gone on to add,
&#8220;Wherefore He saith, He hath ascended up on high, He hath led
captivity captive, and hath given gifts to men.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1019" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p7"> <scripRef passage="Eph. iv. 7, 8" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p7.2" parsed="|Eph|4|7|4|8" osisRef="Bible:Eph.4.7-Eph.4.8">Eph. iv. 7, 8</scripRef></p></note> And every
one knows that the Lord Jesus, when He had ascended into heaven
after the resurrection from the dead, gave the Holy Spirit, with
whom they who believed were filled, and spake with the tongues of
all nations. And let no one object that he says <i>gifts</i>, not
<i>gift</i>: for he quoted the text from the Psalm. And in the
Psalm it is read thus, &#8220;Thou hast ascended up on high, Thou hast
led captivity captive, Thou hast received gifts in men.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1020" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p8"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lxviii. 18" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p8.2" parsed="|Ps|68|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.68.18">Ps. lxviii. 18</scripRef></p></note> For so it

Hebrew. The apostle therefore said <i>gifts</i>, as the prophet
did, not <i>gift</i>. But whereas the prophet said, &#8220;Thou hast
received gifts in men,&#8221; the apostle has preferred saying, &#8220;He
gave gifts to men:&#8221; and this in order that the fullest sense may
be gathered from both expressions, the one prophetic, the other
apostolic; because both possess the authority of a divine
utterance. For both are true, as well that He gave to men, as that
He received in men. He gave to men, as the head to His own members:
He Himself that gave, received in men, no doubt as in His own
members; on account of which, namely, His own members, He cried
from heaven, &#8220;Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?&#8221;<note place="end" n="1021" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p8.5"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p9"> <scripRef passage="Acts ix. 4" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p9.2" parsed="|Acts|9|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.9.4">Acts ix. 4</scripRef></p></note> And of
which, namely, His own members, He says, &#8220;Since ye have done it

me.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1022" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p9.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p10"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 25.40" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p10.1" parsed="|Matt|25|40|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.40">Matt. xxv. 40</scripRef></p></note> Christ
Himself, therefore, both gave from heaven and received on earth.
And further, both prophet and apostle have said gifts for this
reason, because many gifts, which are proper to each, are divided
in common to all the members of Christ, by the Gift, which is the
Holy Spirit. For each severally has not all, but some have these
and some have those; although all have the Gift itself by which
that which is proper to each is divided to Him, <i>i.e.</i> the
Holy Spirit. For elsewhere also, when he had mentioned many gifts,
&#8220;All these,&#8221; he says, &#8220;worketh that one and the self-same
Spirit, dividing to each severally as He will.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1023" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p11"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xii. 11" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p11.2" parsed="|1Cor|12|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.11">1 Cor. xii. 11</scripRef></p></note> And this
word is found also in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where it is
written, &#8220;God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders,
and with divers miracles, and gifts<note place="end" n="1024" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p11.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p12"> <i>

here, when he had said, &#8220;He ascended up on high, He led captivity

ascended, what is it but that He also first descended into the
lower parts of the earth? He who descended is the same also that
ascended up far above all heavens, that He might fill all things.
And He gave some apostles, some prophets, and some evangelists, and
some pastors and doctors.&#8221; (This we see is the reason why gifts

the word; and they of the circumcision that believed, as many as
came with Peter, were astonished, because that upon the Gentiles
also the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out. For they heard

of the Lord, how He said, that John indeed baptized with water, but

satisfied with those we have alleged?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p22">36. Certainly they must be warned,
since they now see that the Holy Spirit is called the gift of God,
that when they hear of &#8220;the gift of the Holy Spirit,&#8221; they
should recognize therein that mode of speech which is found in the
words, &#8220;In the spoiling of the body of the flesh.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1033" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p23"> <scripRef passage="Col. ii. 11" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p23.2" parsed="|Col|2|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.2.11">Col. ii. 11</scripRef></p></note> For as the

But in Himself He is God, although He were given to no one, because
He was God co-eternal with the Father and the Son before He was
given to any one. Nor is He less than they, because they give, and
He is given. For He is given as a gift of God in such way that He
Himself also gives Himself as being God. For He cannot be said not
to be in His own power, of whom it is said, &#8220;The Spirit bloweth
where it listeth;&#8221;<note place="end" n="1034" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p23.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p24"> <scripRef passage="John iii. 6" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p24.2" parsed="|John|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.3.6">John iii. 6</scripRef></p></note> and the apostle says, as I have
already mentioned above, &#8220;All these things worketh that selfsame
Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will.&#8221; We have not
here the creating of Him that is given, and the rule of them that
give, but the concord of the given and the givers.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p25">37. Wherefore, if Holy Scripture
proclaims that God is love, and that love is of God, and works this
in us that we abide in God and He in us, and that hereby we know
this, because He has given us of His Spirit, then the Spirit
Himself is God, who is love. Next, if there be among the gifts of
God none greater than love, and there is no greater gift of God
than the Holy Spirit, what follows more naturally than that He is
Himself love, who is called both God and of God? And if the love by
which the Father loves the Son, and the Son loves the Father,
ineffably demonstrates the communion of both, what is more suitable
than that He should be specially called love, who is the Spirit
common to both? For this is the sounder thing both to believe and
to understand, that the Holy Spirit is not alone love in that
Trinity, yet is not specially called love to no purpose, for the
reasons we have alleged; just as He is not alone in that Trinity
either a Spirit or holy, since both the Father is a Spirit, and the
Son is a Spirit; and both the Father is holy, and the Son is
holy,&#8212;as piety doubts not. And yet it is not to no purpose that
He is specially called the Holy Spirit; for because He is common to
both, He is specially called that which both are in common.
Otherwise, if in that Trinity the Holy Spirit alone is love, then
doubtless the Son too turns out to be the Son, not of the Father
only, but also of the Holy <pb n="220" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_220.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-Page_220"/>Spirit. For He is both said and
read in countless places to be so,&#8212;the only-begotten Son of God
the Father; as that what the apostle says of God the Father is true
too: &#8220;Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath
translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His own love.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1035" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p26"> <scripRef passage="Col. i. 13" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p26.2" parsed="|Col|1|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.1.13">Col. i. 13</scripRef></p></note> He did not
say, &#8220;of His own Son.&#8221; If He had so said, He would have said it
most truly, just as He did say it most truly, because He has often
said it; but He says, &#8220;the Son of His own love.&#8221; Therefore He
is the Son also of the Holy Spirit, if there is in that Trinity no
love in God except the Holy Spirit. And if this is most absurd, it
remains that the Holy Spirit is not alone therein love, but is
specially so called for the reasons I have sufficiently set forth;
and that the words, &#8220;Son of His own love,&#8221; mean nothing else
than His own beloved Son,&#8212;the Son, in short, of His own
substance. For the love in the Father, which is in His ineffably
simple nature, is nothing else than His very nature and substance
itself,&#8212;as we have already often said, and are not ashamed of
often repeating. And hence the &#8220;Son of His love,&#8221; is none other
than He who is born of His substance.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xx-p2">38. Wherefore the logic of
Eunomius, from whom the Eunomian heretics sprang, is ridiculous.
For when he could not understand, and would not believe, that the
only-begotten Word of God, by which all things were made is the Son
of God by nature,&#8212;<i>i.e.</i> born of the substance of the
Father,&#8212;he alleged that He was not the Son of His own nature or
substance or essence, but the Son of the will of God; so as to mean
to assert that the will by which he begot the Son was something
accidental [and optional] to God,&#8212;to wit, in that way that we
ourselves sometimes will something which before we did not will, as
though it was not for these very things that our nature is
perceived to be changeable,&#8212;a thing which far be it from us to
believe of God. For it is written, &#8220;Many are the thoughts in the
heart of man, but the counsel of the Lord abideth for ever,&#8221;<note place="end" n="1036" id="iv.i.xvii.xx-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xx-p3"> <scripRef passage="Prov. xix. 21" id="iv.i.xvii.xx-p3.2" parsed="|Prov|19|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.19.21">Prov. xix. 21</scripRef></p></note> for no
other reason except that we may understand or believe that as God
is eternal, so is His counsel for eternity, and therefore
unchangeable, as He himself is. And what is said of thoughts can
most truly be said also of the will: there are many wills in the
heart of man, but the will of the Lord abideth for ever. Some,
again, to escape saying that the only-begotten Word is the Son of
the counsel or will of God, have affirmed the same Word to be the
counsel or will itself of the Father. But it is better in my
judgment to say counsel of counsel, and will of will, as substance
of substance, wisdom of wisdom, that we may not be led into that
absurdity, which we have refuted already, and say that the Son
makes the Father wise or willing, if the Father has not in His own
substance either counsel or will. It was certainly a sharp answer
that somebody gave to the heretic, who most subtly asked him
whether God begat the Son willingly or unwillingly, in order that
if he said unwillingly, it would follow most absurdly that God was
miserable; but if willingly, he would forthwith infer, as though by
an invincible reason, that at which he was aiming, <i>viz</i>. that
He was the Son, not of His nature, but of His will. But that other,
with great wakefulness, demanded of him in turn, whether God the
Father was God willingly or unwillingly; in order that if he
answered unwillingly, that misery would follow, which to believe of
God is sheer madness; and if he said willingly, it would be replied
to him, Then He is God too by His own will, not by His nature. What
remained, then, except that he should hold his peace, and discern
that he was himself bound by his own question in an insoluble bond?
But if any person in the Trinity is also to be specially called the
will of God, this name, like love, is better suited to the Holy
Spirit; for what else is love, except will?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xx-p4">39. I see that my argument in this
book respecting the Holy Spirit, according to the Holy Scripture,
is quite enough for faithful men who know already that the Holy
Spirit is God, and not of another substance, nor less than the
Father and the Son,&#8212;as we have shown to be true in the former
books, according to the same Scriptures. We have reasoned also from
the creature which God made, and, as far as we could, have warned
those who demand a reason on such subjects to behold and understand
His invisible things, so far as they could, by those things which
are made<note place="end" n="1037" id="iv.i.xvii.xx-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xx-p5"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 20" id="iv.i.xvii.xx-p5.2" parsed="|Rom|1|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.20">Rom. i. 20</scripRef></p></note> and
especially by the rational or intellectual creature which is made
after the image of God; through which glass, so to say, they might
discern as far as they could, if they could, the Trinity which is
God, in our own memory, understanding, will. Which three things, if
any one intelligently regards as by nature divinely appointed in
his own mind, and remembers by memory, contemplates by <pb n="221" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_221.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xx-Page_221"/>understanding, embraces by love, how great a thing that
is in the mind, whereby even the eternal and unchangeable nature
can be recollected, beheld, desired, doubtless that man finds an
image of that highest Trinity. And he ought to refer the whole of
his life to the remembering, seeing, loving that highest Trinity,
in order that he may recollect, contemplate, be delighted by it.
But I have warned him, so far as seemed sufficient, that he must
not so compare this image thus wrought by that Trinity, and by his
own fault changed for the worse, to that same Trinity as to think
it in all points like to it, but rather that he should discern in
that likeness, of whatever sort it be, a great unlikeness
also.</p>

small a degree soever, by conjecture, in our memory and
understanding, to intimate God the Father and God the Son: <i>
i.e.</i> God the begetter, who has in some way spoken by His own
co-eternal Word all things that He has in His substance; and God
His Word Himself, who Himself has nothing either more or less in
substance than is in Him, who, not lyingly but truly, hath begotten
the Word; and I have assigned to memory everything that we know,
even if we were not thinking of it, but to understanding the
formation after a certain special mode of the thought. For we are
usually said to understand what, by thinking of it, we have found
to be true; and this it is again that we leave in the memory. But
that is a still more hidden depth of our memory, wherein we found
this also first when we thought of it, and wherein an inner word is
begotten such as belongs to no tongue,&#8212;as it were, knowledge of
knowledge, vision of vision, and understanding which appears in
[reflective] thought; of understanding which had indeed existed
before in the memory, but was latent there, although, unless the
thought itself had also some sort of memory of its own, it would
not return to those things which it had left in the memory while it
turned to think of other things.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xxi-p4">41. But I have shown nothing in
this enigma respecting the Holy Spirit such as might appear to be
like Him, except our own will, or love, or affection, which is a
stronger will, since our will which we have naturally is variously
affected, according as various objects are adjacent or occur to it,
by which we are attracted or offended. What, then, is this? Are we
to say that our will, when it is right, knows not what to desire,
what to avoid? Further, if it knows, doubtless then it has a kind
of knowledge of its own, such as cannot be without memory and
understanding. Or are we to listen to any one who should say that
love knows not what it does, which does not do wrongly? As, then,
there are both understanding and love in that primary memory
wherein we find provided and stored up that to which we can come in
thought, because we find also those two things there, when we find
by thinking that we both understand and love anything; which things
were there too when we were not thinking of them: and as there are
memory and love in that understanding, which is formed by thought,
which true word we say inwardly without the tongue of any nation
when we say what we know; for the gaze of our thought does not
return to anything except by remembering it, and does not care to
return unless by loving it: so love, which combines the vision
brought about in the memory, and the vision of the thought formed
thereby, as if parent and offspring, would not know what to love
rightly unless it had a knowledge of what it desired, which it
cannot have without memory and understanding.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xxii-p2">42. But since these are in one
person, as man is, some one may say to us, These three things,
memory, understanding, and love, are mine, not their own; neither
do they do that which they do for themselves, but for me, or rather
I do it by them. For it is I who remember by memory, and understand
by understanding, and love by love: and when I direct the mind&#8217;s
eye to my memory, and so say in my heart the thing I know, and a
true word is begotten of my knowledge, both are mine, both the
knowledge certainly and the word. For it is I who know, and it is I
who say in my heart the thing I know. And when I come to find in my
memory by thinking that I understand and love anything, which
understanding and love were there also before I thought thereon, it
is my own understanding and my own love that I find in my own
memory, whereby it is I that understand, 
<pb n="222" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_222.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xxii-Page_222"/>and I that love, not
those things themselves. Likewise, when my thought is mindful, and
wills to return to those things which it had left in the memory,
and to understand and behold them, and say them inwardly, it is my
own memory that is mindful, and it is my own, not its will,
wherewith it wills. When my very love itself, too, remembers and
understands what it ought to desire and what to avoid, it remembers
by my, not by its own memory; and understands that which it
intelligently loves by my, not by its own, understanding. In brief,
by all these three things, it is I that remember, I that
understand, I that love, who am neither memory, nor understanding,
nor love, but who have them. These things, then, can be said by a
single person, which has these three, but is not these three. But
in the simplicity of that Highest Nature, which is God, although
there is one God, there are three persons, the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xxiii-p2">43. A thing itself, then, which is
a trinity is different from the image of a trinity in some other
thing; by reason of which image, at the same time that also in
which these three things are is called an image; just as both the
panel, and the picture painted on it, are at the same time called
an image; but by reason of the picture painted on it, the panel
also is called by the name of image. But in that Highest Trinity,
which is incomparably above all things, there is so great an
indivisibility, that whereas a trinity of men cannot be called one
man, in that, there both is said to be and is one God, nor is that
Trinity in one God, but it is one God. Nor, again, as that image in
the case of man has these three things but is one person, so is it
with the Trinity; but therein are three persons, the Father of the
Son, and the Son of the Father, and the Spirit of both Father and
Son. For although the memory in the case of man, and especially
that memory which beasts have not&#8212;<i>viz</i>. the memory by which
things intelligible are so contained as that they have not entered
that memory through the bodily senses<note place="end" n="1039" id="iv.i.xvii.xxiii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xxiii-p3"> [The reader will observe that
Augustin has employed the term &#8220;memory&#8221; in a wider sense than
in the modern ordinary use. With him, it is the mind as including
all that is potential or latent in it. The innate ideas, in this
use, are laid up in the &#8220;memory,&#8221; and called into consciousness
or &#8220;remembered&#8221; by reflection. The idea of God, for example, is
not in the &#8220;memory&#8221; when not elicited by reflection. The same
is true of the ideas of space and time, etc.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note>&#8212;has in this image of the
Trinity, in proportion to its own small measure, a likeness of the
Father, incomparably unequal, yet of some sort, whatever it be: and
likewise the understanding in the case of man, which by the purpose
of the thought is formed thereby, when that which is known is said,
and there is a word of the heart belonging to no tongue, has in its
own great disparity some likeness of the Son; and love in the case
of man proceeding from knowledge, and combining memory and
understanding, as though common to parent and offspring, whereby it
is understood to be neither parent nor offspring, has in that
image, some, however exceedingly unequal, likeness of the Holy
Spirit: it is nevertheless not the case, that, as in that image of
the Trinity, these three are not one man, but belong to one man, so
in the Highest Trinity itself, of which this is an image, these
three belong to one God, but they are one God, and these are three
persons, not one. A thing certainly wonderfully ineffable, or
ineffably wonderful, that while this image of the Trinity is one
person, but the Highest Trinity itself is three persons, yet that
Trinity of three persons is more indivisible than this of one. For
that [Trinity], in the nature of the Divinity, or perhaps better
Deity, is that which it is, and is mutually and always unchangeably
equal: and there was no time when it was not, or when it was
otherwise; and there will be no time when it will not be, or when
it will be otherwise. But these three that are in the inadequate
image, although they are not separate in place, for they are not
bodies, yet are now in this life mutually separate in magnitude.
For that there are therein no several bulks, does not hinder our
seeing that memory is greater than understanding in one man, but
the contrary in another; and that in yet another these two are
overpassed by the greatness of love; and this whether the two
themselves are or are not equal to one another. And so each two by
each one, and each one by each two, and each one by each one: the
less are surpassed by the greater. And when they have been healed
of all infirmity, and are mutually equal, not even then will that
thing which by grace will not be changed, be made equal to that
which by nature cannot change, because the creature cannot be
equalled to the Creator, and when it shall be healed from all
infirmity, will be changed.</p>

Christ, in order to signify this, gave to them the Holy Spirit,

Spirit, at any rate we ought not to doubt that the same Holy Spirit
was given when Jesus breathed upon them, of whom He by and by says,
&#8220;Go, baptize all nations in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Spirit,&#8221; where this Trinity is especially
commended to us. It is therefore He who was also given from heaven
on the day of Pentecost, <i>i.e.</i> ten days after the Lord
ascended into heaven. How, therefore, is He not God, who gives the
Holy Spirit? Nay, how great a God is He who gives God! For no one
of His disciples gave the Holy Spirit, since they prayed that He
might come upon those upon whom they laid their hands: they did not
give Him themselves. And the Church preserves this custom even now
in the case of her rulers. Lastly, Simon Magus also, when he
offered the apostles money, does not say, &#8220;Give me also this
power, that I may give&#8221; the Holy Spirit; but, &#8220;that on

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xxvi-p23">47. Are we therefore able to ask
whether the Holy Spirit had already proceeded from the Father when
the Son was born, or had not yet proceeded; and when He was born,
proceeded from both, wherein there is no such thing as distinct
times: just as we have been able to ask, in a case where we do find
times, that the will proceeds from the human mind first, in order
that that may be sought which, when found, may be called offspring;
which offspring being already brought forth or born, that will is
made perfect, resting in this end, so that what had been its desire
when seeking, is its love when enjoying; which love now proceeds

things it is absolutely impossible to ask in this case, where
nothing is begun in time, so as to be perfected in a time
following. Wherefore let him who can understand the generation of
the Son from the Father without time, understand also the

as the Father has in Himself that the Holy Spirit should proceed
from Him, so has He given to the Son that the same Holy Spirit
should proceed from Him, and be both apart from time: and that the
Holy Spirit is so said to proceed from the Father as that it be
understood that His proceeding also from the Son, is a property
derived by the Son from the Father. For if the Son has of the
Father whatever He has, then certainly He has of the Father, that
the Holy Spirit proceeds also from Him. But let no one think of any
times therein which imply a sooner and a later; because these
things are not there at all. How, then, would it not be most absurd
to call Him the Son of both: when, just as generation from the
Father, without any changeableness of nature, gives to the Son
essence, without beginning of time; so procession from both,
without any changeableness of nature, gives to the Holy Spirit
essence without beginning of time? For while we do not say that the
Holy Spirit is begotten, yet we do not therefore dare to say that
He is unbegotten, lest any one suspect in this word either two
Fathers in that Trinity, or two who are not from another. For the

principally.&#8221; As Turrettin says: &#8220;The Father and Son spirate
the Spirit, not as two different essences in each of which resides
a spirative energy, but as two personal subsistences of one
essence, who concur in one act of spiration.&#8221; <i>Institutio</i>

would be called the Son of the Father and of the Son, if&#8212;a thing
abhorrent to the feeling of all sound minds&#8212;both had <i>
begotten</i> Him. Therefore the Spirit of both is not begotten of
both, but proceeds from both.</p>

difficult to distinguish generation from procession in that
co-eternal, and equal, and incorporeal, and ineffably unchangeable
and indivisible Trinity, let it suffice meanwhile to put before
those who are not able to be drawn on further, what we said upon
this subject in a sermon to be delivered in the ears of Christian
people, and after saying wrote it down. For when, among other
things, I had taught them by testimonies of the Holy Scriptures
that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both, I continue: &#8220;If, then,
the Holy Spirit proceeds both from the Father and from the Son, why
did the Son say, &#8216;He proceedeth from the Father?&#8217;<note place="end" n="1070" id="iv.i.xvii.xxvii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xxvii-p3"> <scripRef passage="John xv. 26" id="iv.i.xvii.xxvii-p3.2" parsed="|John|15|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.15.26">John xv. 26</scripRef></p></note> Why, think

therefore, it is His doctrine that is here understood, which yet He
said was not His own, but His that sent Him, how much more is it
there to be understood that the Holy Spirit proceeds also from
Himself, where He so says, He proceedeth from the Father, as not to
say, He proceedeth not from me? From Him, certainly, from whom the
Son had his Divine nature, for He is God of God, He has also, that
from Him too proceeds the Holy Spirit; and hence the Holy Spirit
has from the Father Himself, that He should proceed from the Son
also, as He proceeds from the Father. Here, too, in some way may
this also be understood, so far as it can be understood by such as
we are, why the Holy Spirit is not said to be born, but rather to
proceed;<note place="end" n="1072" id="iv.i.xvii.xxvii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xxvii-p5"> [Generation and procession are
each an emanation of the essence by which it is modified. Neither
of them is a creation <i>ex nihilo</i>. The school-men attempted to
explain the difference between the two emanations, by saying that
the generation of the Son is by the mode of the intellect&#8212;hence
the Son is called Wisdom, or Word (Logos); but the procession of
the Spirit is by the mode of the will&#8212;hence the Spirit is called
Love. Turrettin distinguishes the difference by the following
particulars: 1. In respect to the source. Generation is from the
Father alone; procession is from Father and Son. 2. In respect to
effects. Generation yields not only personality, but resemblance.
The Son is the &#8220;image&#8221; of the Father, but the Spirit is not the
image of the Father and Son. Generation is accompanied with the
power to communicate the essence; procession is not. 3. In respect
to order of relationship. Generation is second, procession is
third. In the order of nature, not of time (for both generation and
procession are eternal, therefore simultaneous), procession is
after generation. <i>Institutio</i> III. xxxi.

He, too, was called a Son, He would certainly be called the Son of
both, which is most absurd, since no one is son of two, save of
father and mother. But far be it from us to surmise any such thing
as this between God the Father and God the Son. Because not even
the son of men proceeds at the same time from both father and
mother; but when he proceeds from the father into the mother, he
does not at that time proceed from the mother; and when he proceeds
from the mother into this present light, he does not at that time
proceed from the father. But the Holy Spirit does not proceed from
the Father into the Son, and from the Son proceed to sanctify the
creature, but proceeds at once from both; although the Father has
given this to the Son, that He should proceed, as from Himself, so
also from Him. For we cannot say that the Holy Spirit is not life,
while the Father is life, and the Son is life: and hence as the
Father, while He has life in Himself, has given also to the Son to
have life in Himself; so has He given also to Him that life should
proceed from Him, as it also proceeds from Himself.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1073" id="iv.i.xvii.xxvii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xxvii-p6"> Serm. in <i>Joh. Evang.

unbelievers; and when this foundation is first laid, let them be
built up to see what they believe, that at some time they may be
able to see. For some things are so believed, that they cannot be
seen at all. For Christ is not to be seen a second time on the
cross; but unless this be believed which has been so done and seen,
that it is not now to be hoped for as about to be and to be seen,
there is no coming to Christ, such as without end He is to be seen.
But as far as relates to the discerning in some way by the
understanding that highest, ineffable, incorporeal, and
unchangeable nature the sight of the human mind can nowhere better
exercise itself, so only that the rule of faith govern it, than in
that which man himself has in his own nature better than the other
animals, better also than the other parts of his own soul, which is
the mind itself, to which has been assigned a certain sight of
things invisible, and to which, as though honorably presiding in a
higher and inner place, the bodily senses also bring word of all
things, that they may be judged, and than which there is no higher,
to which it is to be subject, and by which it is to be governed,

then, thou hast seen many things that are true, and hast
distinguished them from that light by the light of which thou hast
seen them. Lift up thine eyes to the light itself, and fix them
upon it if thou canst. For so thou wilt see how the birth of the
Word of God differs from the procession of the Gift of God, on
account of which the only-begotten Son did not say that the Holy
Spirit is begotten of the Father, otherwise He would be His
brother, but that he proceeds from Him. Whence, since the Spirit
of both is a kind of consubstantial communion of Father and Son, He
is not called, far be it from us to say so, the Son of both. But
thou canst not fix thy sight there, so as to discern this lucidly
and clearly; I know thou canst not. I say the truth, I say to
myself, I know what I cannot do; yet that light itself shows to
thee these three things in thyself, wherein thou mayest recognize
an image of the highest Trinity itself, which thou canst not yet
contemplate with steady eye. Itself shows to thee that there is in
thee a true word, when it is born of thy knowledge, <i>i.e.</i>
when we say what we know: although we neither utter nor think of
any articulate word that is significant in any tongue of any
nation, but our thought is formed by that which we know; and there
is in the mind&#8217;s eye of the thinker an image resembling that
thought which the memory contained, will or love as a third
combining these two as parent and offspring. And he who can, sees
and discerns that this will proceeds indeed from thought (for no
one wills that of which he is absolutely ignorant what or of what
sort it is), yet is not an image of the thought: and so that there
is insinuated in this intelligible thing a sort of difference
between birth and procession, since to behold by thought is not the
same as to desire, or even to enjoy will. Thou, too, hast been able
[to discern this], although thou hast not been, neither art, able
to unfold with adequate speech what, amidst the clouds of bodily
likenesses, which cease not to flit up and down before human
thoughts, thou hast scarcely seen. But that light which is not
thyself shows thee this too, that these incorporeal likenesses of
bodies are different from the truth, which, by rejecting them, we
contemplate with the understanding. These, and other things
similarly certain, that light hath shown to thine inner eyes. What
reason, then, is there why thou canst not see that light itself
with steady eye, except certainly infirmity? And what has produced
this in thee, except iniquity? Who, then, is it that healeth all
thine infirmities, unless it be He that forgiveth all thine
iniquities? And therefore I will now at length finish this book by
a prayer better than by an argument.</p>

(<i>Hand-Book</i>). There I think I have pretty carefully treated

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.i-p6">The <i>Enchiridion</i> is among the
latest books of Augustin. It was written after the death of Jerome,
which occurred Sept. 30, 420; for he alludes in ch. 87 to Jerome
&#8220;of blessed memory&#8221; (<i>sanct&#230; memori&#230; Hieronymus

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.i-p7">It is addressed to Laurentius, in
answer to his questions. This person is otherwise unknown. One
<span class="c19" id="iv.ii.i-p7.1">ms</span>. calls him a deacon, another a notary
of the city of Rome. He was probably a layman.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.i-p8">The author usually calls the book
&#8220;On Faith, Hope and Love,&#8221; because he treats the subject under
these three heads (comp. (<scripRef passage="I Cor. xiii. 13" id="iv.ii.i-p8.2" parsed="|1Cor|13|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.13">I Cor. xiii.

Apostles&#8217; Creed, and refutes, without naming them, the
Manich&#230;an, Apollinarian, Arian, and Pelagian heresies. Under the
second head he gives a brief exposition of the Lord&#8217;s Prayer. The

of the Benedictine edition. A neat edition of the Latin text, with
three other small tracts of Augustin, (<i>De Catechizandis Rudibus;
De Fide Rerum qu&#230; non creduntur; De Utilitate Credendi</i>), is
also published in C. Marriott&#8217;s <i>S. Aurelius Augustinus</i>,
4th ed. by H. de Romestin, Oxford and London (Parker and Comp.),
1885 (pp. 150&#8211;251.) An English edition of the same tracts by H.
de Romestin, Oxford and London, 1885 (pp. 151&#8211;251). His English
translation is based on that of C. L. Cornish, M.A., which appeared
in the Oxford &#8220;Library of the Fathers,&#8221; Oxford 1847
(&#8220;Seventeen Short Treatises of St. Aug.&#8221; pp.
85&#8211;158).</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.i-p10">The present translation by
Professor Shaw was first published in Dr. Dods&#8217;s series of
Augustin&#8217;s works, Edinburgh, (T. and T. Clark,) 3d ed. 1883. It
is more free and idiomatic than that of Cornish. I have in a few
cases conformed it more closely to the original.</p>

<p class="c43" id="iv.ii.ii-p4"><i>Laurentius having asked Augustin
to furnish him with a handbook of Christian doctrine, containing in
brief compass answers to several questions which he had proposed,
Augustin shows him that these questions can be fully answered by
any one who knows the proper objects of faith, hope, and love. He
then proceeds, in the first part of the work (Chap. ix.&#8212;cxiii.),
to expound the objects of faith, taking as his text the Apostles&#8217;
Creed; and in the course of this exposition, besides refuting
divers heresies, he throws out many observations on the conduct of
life. The second part of the work (Chap. cxiv.&#8212;cxvi.) treats of
the objects of hope, and consists of a very brief exposition of the
several petitions in the Lord&#8217;s Prayer. The third and concluding
part (Chap. cxvii.-cxxii.) treats of the objects of love, showing
the pre-eminence of this grace in the gospel system, that it is the
end of the commandment and the fulfilling of the law, and that God
himself is love.</i></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.vi-p2">You are anxious, you say, that I
should write a sort of handbook for you, which you might always
keep beside you, containing answers to the questions you put, <i>
viz.</i>: what ought to be man&#8217;s chief end in life; what he
ought, in view of the various heresies, chiefly to avoid; to what
extent religion is supported by reason; what there is in reason
that lends no support to faith, when faith stands alone; what is
the starting-point, what the goal, of religion; what is the sum of
the whole body of doctrine; what is the sure and proper foundation
of the catholic faith. Now, undoubtedly, you will know the answers
to all these questions, if you know thoroughly the proper objects
of faith, hope, and love. For these must be the chief, nay, the
exclusive objects of pursuit in religion. He who speaks against
these is either a total stranger to the name of Christ, or is a
heretic. These are to be defended by reason, which must have its
starting-point either in the bodily senses or in the intuitions of
the mind. And what we have neither had experience of through our
bodily senses, nor have been able to reach through the intellect,
must undoubtedly be believed on the testimony of those witnesses by
whom the Scriptures, justly called divine, were written; and who by
divine assistance were enabled, either through bodily sense or
intellectual perception, to see or to foresee the things in
question.</p>

endeavors by purity of life to attain unto sight, where the pure
and perfect in heart know that unspeakable beauty, the full vision
of which is supreme happiness. Here surely is an answer to your
question as to what is the starting-point, and what the goal: we
begin in faith, and are made perfect by sight. This also is the sum
of the whole body of doctrine. But the sure and proper foundation
of the catholic faith is Christ. &#8220;For other foundation,&#8221; says
the apostle, &#8220;can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus
Christ.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1095" id="iv.ii.vii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.vii-p4"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. iii. 11" id="iv.ii.vii-p4.2" parsed="|1Cor|3|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.11">1 Cor. iii. 11</scripRef></p></note> Nor are we
to deny that this is the proper foundation of the catholic faith,
because it may be supposed that some heretics hold this in common
with us. For if we carefully consider the things that pertain to
Christ, we shall find that, among those heretics who call
themselves Christians, Christ is present in name only: in deed and
in truth He is not among them. But to show this would occupy us too
long, for we should require to go over all the heresies which have
existed, which do exist, or which could exist, under the Christian
name, and to show that this is true in the case of each,&#8212;a
discussion which would occupy so many volumes as to be all but
interminable.</p>

state what are the true and proper objects of each of these is
easy. But to defend this true doctrine against the assaults of
those who hold an opposite opinion, requires much fuller and more
elaborate instruction. And the true way to obtain this instruction
is not to have a short treatise put into one&#8217;s hands, but to have
a great zeal kindled in one&#8217;s heart.</p>

human race was groaning under a heavy load of misery, and was in
urgent need of the divine compassion, one of the prophets,
anticipating the time of God&#8217;s grace, declared: &#8220;And it shall
come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord
shall be delivered.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1096" id="iv.ii.ix-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.ix-p3"> <scripRef passage="Joel 2.32" id="iv.ii.ix-p3.1" parsed="|Joel|2|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Joel.2.32">Joel ii. 32</scripRef></p></note> Hence the Lord&#8217;s Prayer. But the
apostle, when, for the purpose of commending this very grace, he
had quoted this prophetic testimony, immediately added: &#8220;How then
shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed?&#8221;<note place="end" n="1097" id="iv.ii.ix-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.ix-p4"> <scripRef passage="Rom. x. 14" id="iv.ii.ix-p4.2" parsed="|Rom|10|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.10.14">Rom. x. 14</scripRef></p></note> Hence the
Creed. In these two you have those three graces exemplified: faith
believes, hope and love pray. But without faith the two last cannot
exist, and therefore we may say that faith also prays. Whence it is
written: &#8220;How shall they call on Him in whom they have not
believed?&#8221;</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.ii.x-p1.1">Chapter 8.&#8212;The Distinction Between Faith and Hope, and
the Mutual Dependence of Faith, Hope, and Love.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.x-p2">Again, can anything be hoped for
which is not an object of faith? It is true that a thing which is
not an object of hope may be believed. What true Christian, for
example, does not believe in the punishment of the wicked? And yet
such an one does not hope for it. And the man who believes that
punishment to be hanging over himself, and who shrinks in horror
from the prospect, is more properly said to fear than to hope. And
these two states of mind the poet carefully distinguishes, when he
says: &#8220;Permit the fearful to have hope.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1098" id="iv.ii.x-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.x-p3"> Lucan, <i>Phars</i>. ii.
15.</p></note> Another poet, who is usually much
superior to this one, makes a wrong use of the word, when he says:
&#8220;If I have been able to hope for so great a grief as this.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1099" id="iv.ii.x-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.x-p4"> Virgil, <i>&#198;neid</i>, iv.
419.</p></note> And some
grammarians take this case as an example of impropriety of speech,
saying, &#8220;He said <i>sperare</i> [to hope] instead of <i>
timere</i> [to fear].&#8221; Accordingly, faith may have for its object
evil as well as good; for both good and evil are believed, and the
faith that believes them is not evil, but good. Faith, moreover, is
concerned with the past, the present, and the future, all three. We
believe, for example, that Christ died,&#8212;an event in the past; we
believe that He is sitting at the right hand of God,&#8212;a state of
things which is present; we believe that He will come to judge the
quick and the dead,&#8212;an event of the future. Again, faith applies
both to one&#8217;s own circumstances and those of others. Every one,
for example, believes that his own existence had a beginning, and
was not eternal, and he believes the same both of other men and
other things. Many of our beliefs in regard to religious matters,
again, have reference not merely to other men, but to angels also.
But hope has for its object only what is good, only what is future,
and only what affects the man who entertains the hope. For these
reasons, then, faith must be distinguished from hope, not merely as
a matter of verbal propriety, but because they are essentially
different. The fact that we do not see either what we believe or
what we hope for, is all that is common to faith and hope. In the
Epistle to the Hebrews, for example, faith is defined (and eminent
defenders of the catholic faith have used the definition as a
standard) &#8220;the evidence of things not seen.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1100" id="iv.ii.x-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.x-p5"> <scripRef passage="Heb. xi. 1" id="iv.ii.x-p5.2" parsed="|Heb|11|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.11.1">Heb. xi. 1</scripRef></p></note> Although, should any one say that
he believes, that is, has grounded his faith, not on words, nor on
witnesses, nor on any reasoning whatever, but on the direct
evidence of his own senses, he would not be guilty of such an
impropriety of speech as to be justly liable to the criticism,
&#8220;You saw, therefore you did not believe.&#8221; And hence it does not
follow that an object of faith is not an object of sight. But it is
better that we should use the word &#8220;faith&#8221; as the Scriptures
have taught us, applying it to those things which are not seen.
Concerning hope, again, the apostle says: &#8220;Hope that is seen is
not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we
hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for
it.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1101" id="iv.ii.x-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.x-p6"> <scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 24, 25" id="iv.ii.x-p6.2" parsed="|Rom|8|24|8|25" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.24-Rom.8.25">Rom. viii. 24, 25</scripRef></p></note> When,
then, we believe that good is about to come, this is nothing else
but to hope for it. Now what shall I say of love? Without it, faith
profits nothing; and in its absence, hope cannot exist. The Apostle
James says: &#8220;The devils also believe, and tremble.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1102" id="iv.ii.x-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.x-p7"> <scripRef passage="Jas. ii. 19" id="iv.ii.x-p7.2" parsed="|Jas|2|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jas.2.19">Jas. ii. 19</scripRef></p></note>&#8212;that is,
they, having neither hope nor love, but believing that what we love
and hope for is about to come, are in terror. And so the Apostle
Paul approves and commends the &#8220;faith that worketh by love;&#8221;<note place="end" n="1103" id="iv.ii.x-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.x-p8"> <scripRef passage="Gal. v. 6" id="iv.ii.x-p8.2" parsed="|Gal|5|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.5.6">Gal. v. 6</scripRef></p></note> and this
certainly cannot exist without hope. Wherefore there is no love
without hope, no hope without love, and neither love nor hope
without faith.</p>

animals, plants, stones, fountains, rivers, mountains; about
chronology and distances; the signs of coming storms; and a
thousand other things which those philosophers either have found
out, or think they have found out. For even these men themselves,
endowed though they are with so much genius, burning with zeal,
abounding in leisure, tracking some things by the aid of human
conjecture, searching into others with the aids of history and
experience, have not found out all things; and even their boasted
discoveries are oftener mere guesses than certain knowledge. It is
enough for the Christian to believe that the only cause of all
created things, whether heavenly or earthly, whether visible or
invisible, is the goodness of the Creator the one true God; and
that nothing exists but Himself that does not derive its existence
from Him; and that He is the Trinity&#8212;to wit, the Father, and the

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.xiii-p2">And in the universe, even that
which is called evil, when it is regulated and put in its own
place, only enhances our admiration of the good; for we enjoy and
value the good more when we compare it with the evil. For the
Almighty God, who, as even the heathen acknowledge, has supreme
power over all things, being Himself supremely good, would never
permit the existence of anything evil among His works, if He were
not so omnipotent and good that He can bring good even out of evil.
For what is that which we call evil but the absence of good? In the
bodies of animals, disease and wounds mean nothing but the absence
of health; for when a cure is effected, that does not mean that the
evils which were present&#8212;namely, the diseases and wounds&#8212;go
away from the body and dwell elsewhere: they altogether cease to
exist; for the wound or disease is not a substance, but a defect in
the fleshly substance,&#8212;the flesh itself being a substance, and
therefore something good, of which those evils&#8212;that is,
privations of the good which we call health&#8212;are accidents. Just
in the same way, what are called vices in the soul are nothing but
privations of natural good. And when they are cured, they are not
transferred elsewhere: when they cease to exist in the healthy
soul, they cannot exist anywhere else.</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.ii.xiv-p1.1">Chapter 12.&#8212;All Beings Were Made Good, But Not Being
Made Perfectly Good, are Liable to Corruption.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.xiv-p2">All things that exist, therefore,
seeing that the Creator of them all is supremely good, are
themselves good. But because they are not, like their Creator,
supremely and unchangeably good, their good may be diminished and
increased. But for good to be diminished is an evil, although,
however much it may be diminished, it is necessary, if the being is
to continue, that some good should remain to constitute the being.
For however small or of whatever kind the being may be, the good
which makes it a being cannot be destroyed without destroying the
being itself. An uncorrupted nature is justly held in esteem. But
if, still further, it be incorruptible, it is undoubtedly
considered of still higher value. When it is corrupted, however,
its corruption is an evil, because it is deprived of some sort of
good. For if it be deprived of no good, it receives no injury; but
it does receive injury, therefore it is deprived of good.
Therefore, so long as a being is in process of corruption, there is
in it some good of which it is being deprived; and if a part of the
being should remain which cannot be corrupted, this will certainly
be an incorruptible being, and accordingly the process of
corruption will result in the manifestation of this great good. But
if it do not cease to be corrupted, neither can it cease to possess
good of which corruption may deprive it. But if it should be
thoroughly and completely consumed by corruption, there will then
be no good left, because there will be no being. Wherefore
corruption can consume the good only by consuming the being. Every
being, therefore, is a good; a great good, if it can not be
corrupted; a little good, if it can: but in any case, only the
foolish or ignorant will deny that it is a good. And if it be
wholly <pb n="241" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_241.html" id="iv.ii.xiv-Page_241"/>consumed by corruption, then the corruption itself must
cease to exist, as there is no being left in which it can
dwell.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.xv-p2">Accordingly, there is nothing of
what we call evil, if there be nothing good. But a good which is
wholly without evil is a perfect good. A good, on the other hand,
which contains evil is a faulty or imperfect good; and there can be
no evil where there is no good. From all this we arrive at the
curious result: that since every being, so far as it is a being, is
good, when we say that a faulty being is an evil being, we just
seem to say that what is good is evil, and that nothing but what is
good can be evil, seeing that every being is good, and that no evil
can exist except in a being. Nothing, then, can be evil except
something which is good. And although this, when stated, seems to
be a contradiction, yet the strictness of reasoning leaves us no
escape from the conclusion. We must, however, beware of incurring
the prophetic condemnation: &#8220;Woe unto them that call evil good,
and good evil: that put darkness for light, and light for darkness:
that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1104" id="iv.ii.xv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.xv-p3"> <scripRef passage="Isa. v. 20" id="iv.ii.xv-p3.2" parsed="|Isa|5|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.5.20">Isa. v. 20</scripRef></p></note> And yet

being? for a man is a being. Now, if a man is a good thing because
he is a being, what is an evil man but an evil good? Yet, when we
accurately distinguish these two things, we find that it is not
because he is a man that he is an evil, or because he is wicked
that he is a good; but that he is a good because he is a man, and
an evil because he is wicked. Whoever, then, says, &#8220;To be a man
is an evil,&#8221; or, &#8220;To be wicked is a good,&#8221; falls under the
prophetic denunciation: &#8220;Woe unto them that call evil good, and
good evil!&#8221; For he condemns the work of God, which is the man,
and praises the defect of man, which is the wickedness. Therefore
every being, even if it be a defective one, in so far as it is a
being is good, and in so far as it is defective is
evil.</p>

are an Exception to the Rule that Contrary Attributes Cannot Be
Predicated of the Same Subject. Evil Springs Up in What is Good,
and Cannot Exist Except in What is Good.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.xvi-p2">Accordingly, in the case of these
contraries which we call good and evil, the rule of the logicians,
that two contraries cannot be predicated at the same time of the
same thing, does not hold. No weather is at the same time dark and
bright: no food or drink is at the same time sweet and bitter: no
body is at the same time and in the same place black and white:
none is at the same time and in the same place deformed and
beautiful. And this rule is found to hold in regard to many, indeed
nearly all, contraries, that they cannot exist at the same time in
any one thing. But although no one can doubt that good and evil are
contraries, not only can they exist at the same time, but evil
cannot exist without good, or in anything that is not good. Good,
however, can exist without evil. For a man or an angel can exist
without being wicked; but nothing can be wicked except a man or an
angel: and so far as he is a man or an angel, he is good; so far as
he is wicked, he is an evil. And these two contraries are so far
co-existent, that if good did not exist in what is evil, neither
could evil exist; because corruption could not have either a place
to dwell in, or a source to spring from, if there were nothing that
could be corrupted; and nothing can be corrupted except what is
good, for corruption is nothing else but the destruction of good.
From what is good, then, evils arose, and except in what is good
they do not exist; nor was there any other source from which any
evil nature could arise. For if there were, then, in so far as this
was a being, it was certainly a good: and a being which was
incorruptible would be a great good; and even one which was
corruptible must be to some extent a good, for only by corrupting
what was good in it could corruption do it harm.</p>

grapes do not grow on thorns. But we see that on good soil both

Hurtful, Though It is Man&#8217;s Duty as Far as Possible to Avoid
It.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.xix-p2">For although we ought with the
greatest possible care to avoid error, not only in great but even
in little things, and although we cannot err except through
ignorance, it does not follow that, if a man is ignorant of a
thing, he must forthwith fall into error. That is rather the fate
of the man who thinks he knows what he does not know. For he
accepts what is false as if it were true, and that is the essence
of error. But it is a point of very great importance what the
subject is in regard to which a man makes a mistake. For on one and
the same subject we rightly prefer an instructed man to an ignorant
one, and a man who is not in error to one who is. In the case of
different subjects, however,&#8212;that is, when one man knows one
thing, and another a different thing, and when what the former
knows is useful, and what the latter knows is not so useful, or is
actually hurtful,&#8212;who would not, in regard to the things the
latter knows, prefer the ignorance of the former to the knowledge
of the latter? For there are points on which ignorance is better
than knowledge. And in the same way, it has sometimes been an
advantage to depart from the right way,&#8212;in travelling, however,
not in morals. It has happened to myself to take the wrong road
where two ways met, so that I did not pass by the place where an
armed band of Donatists lay in wait for me. Yet I arrived at the
place whither I was bent, though by a roundabout route; and when I
heard of the ambush, I congratulated myself on my mistake, and gave
thanks to God for it. Now, who would not rather be the traveller
who made a mistake like this, than the highwayman who made no
mistake? And hence, perhaps, it is that the prince of poets puts
these words into the mouth of a lover in misery:<note place="end" n="1111" id="iv.ii.xix-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.xix-p3"> Virgil, <i>Eclog</i>. viii.
41.</p></note> &#8220;How I am undone, how I have
been carried away by an evil error!&#8221; for there is an error which
is good, as it not merely does no harm, but produces some actual
advantage. But when we look more closely into the nature of truth,
and consider that to err is just to take the false for the true,
and the true for the false, or to hold what is certain as
uncertain, and what is uncertain as certain, and that error in the
soul is hideous and repulsive just in proportion as it appears fair
and plausible when we utter it, or assent to it, saying, &#8220;Yea,
yea; Nay, nay,&#8221;&#8212;surely this life that we live is wretched
indeed, if only on this account, that sometimes, in order to
preserve it, it is necessary to fall into error. God forbid that
such should be that other life, where truth itself is the life of
the soul, where no one deceives, and no one is deceived. But here
men deceive and are deceived, and they are more to be pitied when
they lead others astray than when they are themselves led astray by
putting trust in liars. Yet so much does a rational soul shrink
from what is false, and so earnestly does it struggle against
error, that even those who love to deceive are most unwilling to be
deceived. For the liar does not <pb n="243" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_243.html" id="iv.ii.xix-Page_243"/>think that he errs, but that he
leads another who trusts him into error. And certainly he does not
err in regard to the matter about which he lies, if he himself
knows the truth; but he is deceived in this, that he thinks his lie
does him no harm, whereas every sin is more hurtful to the sinner
than to the sinned against.</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.ii.xx-p1.1">Chapter 18.&#8212;It is Never
Allowable to Tell a Lie; But Lies Differ Very Much in Guilt,
According to the Intention and the Subject.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.xx-p2">But here arises a very difficult
and very intricate question, about which I once wrote a large book,
finding it necessary to give it an answer. The question is this:
whether at any time it can become the duty of a good man to tell a
lie? For some go so far as to contend that there are occasions on
which it is a good and pious work to commit perjury even, and to
say what is false about matters that relate to the worship of God,
and about the very nature of God Himself. To me, however, it seems
certain that every lie is a sin, though it makes a great difference
with what intention and on what subject one lies. For the sin of
the man who tells a lie to help another is not so heinous as that
of the man who tells a lie to injure another; and the man who by
his lying puts a traveller on the wrong road, does not do so much
harm as the man who by false or misleading representations distorts
the whole course of a life. No one, of course, is to be condemned
as a liar who says what is false, believing it to be true, because
such an one does not consciously deceive, but rather is himself
deceived. And, on the same principle, a man is not to be accused of
lying, though he may sometimes be open to the charge of rashness,
if through carelessness he takes up what is false and holds it as
true; but, on the other hand, the man who says what is true,
believing it to be false, is, so far as his own consciousness is
concerned, a liar. For in saying what he does not believe, he says
what to his own conscience is false, even though it should in fact
be true; nor is the man in any sense free from lying who with his
mouth speaks the truth without knowing it, but in his heart wills
to tell a lie. And, therefore, not looking at the matter spoken of,
but solely at the intention of the speaker, the man who unwittingly
says what is false, thinking all the time that it is true, is a
better man than the one who unwittingly says what is true, but in
his conscience intends to deceive. For the former does not think
one thing and say another; but the latter, though his statements
may be true in fact, has one thought in his heart and another on
his lips: and that is the very essence of lying. But when we come
to consider truth and falsehood in respect to the subjects spoken
of, the point on which one deceives or is deceived becomes a matter
of the utmost importance. For although, as far as a man&#8217;s own
conscience is concerned, it is a greater evil to deceive than to be
deceived, nevertheless it is a far less evil to tell a lie in
regard to matters that do not relate to religion, than to be led
into error in regard to matters the knowledge and belief of which
are essential to the right worship of God. To illustrate this by
example: suppose that one man should say of some one who is dead
that he is still alive, knowing this to be untrue; and that another
man should, being deceived, believe that Christ shall at the end of
some time (make the time as long as you please) die; would it not
be incomparably better to lie like the former, than to be deceived
like the latter? and would it not be a much less evil to lead some
man into the former error, than to be led by any man into the
latter?</p>

Every Error is in Itself an Evil.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.xxi-p2">In some things, then, it is a great
evil to be deceived; in some it is a small evil; in some no evil at
all; and in some it is an actual advantage. It is to his grievous
injury that a man is deceived when he does not believe what leads
to eternal life, or believes what leads to eternal death. It is a
small evil for a man to be deceived, when, by taking falsehood for
truth, he brings upon himself temporal annoyances; for the patience
of the believer will turn even these to a good use, as when, for
example, taking a bad man for a good, he receives injury from him.
But one who believes a bad man to be good, and yet suffers no
injury, is nothing the worse for being deceived, nor does he fall
under the prophetic denunciation: &#8220;Woe to those who call evil
good!&#8221;<note place="end" n="1112" id="iv.ii.xxi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.xxi-p3"> <scripRef passage="Isa. v. 20" id="iv.ii.xxi-p3.2" parsed="|Isa|5|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.5.20">Isa. v. 20</scripRef></p></note> For we are
to understand that this is spoken not about evil men, but about the
things that make men evil. Hence the man who calls adultery good,
falls justly under that prophetic denunciation. But the man who
calls the adulterer good, thinking him to be chaste, and not
knowing him to be an adulterer, falls into no error in regard to
the nature of good and evil, but only makes a mistake as to the
secrets of human conduct. He calls <pb n="244" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_244.html" id="iv.ii.xxi-Page_244"/>the man good on the ground of
believing him to be what is undoubtedly good; he calls the
adulterer evil, and the pure man good; and he calls this man good,
not knowing him to be an adulterer, but believing him to be pure.
Further, if by making a mistake one escape death, as I have said
above once happened to me, one even derives some advantage from
one&#8217;s mistake. But when I assert that in certain cases a man may
be deceived without any injury to himself, or even with some
advantage to himself, I do not mean that the mistake in itself is
no evil, or is in any sense a good; I refer only to the evil that
is avoided, or the advantage that is gained, through making the
mistake. For the mistake, considered in itself, is an evil: a great
evil if it concern a great matter, a small evil if it concern a
small matter, but yet always an evil. For who that is of sound mind
can deny that it is an evil to receive what is false as if it were
true, and to reject what is true as if it were false, or to hold
what is uncertain as certain, and what is certain as uncertain? But
it is one thing to think a man good when he is really bad, which is
a mistake; it is another thing to suffer no ulterior injury in
consequence of the mistake, supposing that the bad man whom we
think good inflicts no damage upon us. In the same way, it is one
thing to think that we are on the right road when we are not; it is
another thing when this mistake of ours, which is an evil, leads to
some good, such as saving us from an ambush of wicked
men.</p>

mistakes of this kind, ought to be called sins. Nor do I now
undertake to solve a very knotty question, which perplexed those
very acute thinkers, the Academic philosophers: whether a wise man
ought to give his assent to anything, seeing that he may fall into
error by assenting to falsehood: for all things, as they assert,
are either unknown or uncertain. Now I wrote three volumes shortly
after my conversion, to remove out of my way the objections which
lie, as it were, on the very threshold of faith. And assuredly it
was necessary at the very outset to remove this utter despair of
reaching truth, which seems to be strengthened by the arguments of
these philosophers. Now in their eyes every error is regarded as a
sin, and they think that error can only be avoided by entirely
suspending belief. For they say that the man who assents to what is
uncertain falls into error; and they strive by the most acute, but
most audacious arguments, to show that, even though a man&#8217;s
opinion should by chance be true, yet that there is no certainty of
its truth, owing to the impossibility of distinguishing truth from
falsehood. But with us, &#8220;the just shall live by faith.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1115" id="iv.ii.xxii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.xxii-p5"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 17" id="iv.ii.xxii-p5.2" parsed="|Rom|1|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.17">Rom. i. 17</scripRef></p></note> Now, if
assent be taken away, faith goes too; for without assent there can
be no belief. And there are truths, whether we know them or not,
which must be believed if we would attain to a happy life, that is,
to eternal life. But I am not sure whether one ought to argue with
men who not only do not know that there is an eternal life before
them, but do not know whether they are living at the present
moment; nay, say that they do not know what it is impossible they
can be ignorant of. For it is impossible that any one should be
ignorant that he is alive, seeing that if he be not alive it is
impossible for him to be ignorant; for not knowledge merely, but
ignorance too, can be an attribute only of the living. But,
forsooth, they think that by not acknowledging that they are alive
they avoid error, when even their very error proves that they are
alive, since one who is not alive cannot err. As, then, it is not
only true, but certain, that we are alive, so there are many other
things both true and certain; and God forbid that it should ever be
called wisdom, and not the height of folly, to refuse assent to
these.</p>

faith through which we reach eternal blessedness, yet they have
much to do with that misery in which we are now living. And

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.xxiv-p2">But every lie must be called a sin,
because not only when a man knows the truth, but even when, as a
man may be, he is mistaken and deceived, it is his duty to say what
he thinks in his heart, whether it be true, or whether he only
think it to be true. But every liar says the opposite of what he
thinks in his heart, with purpose to deceive. Now it is evident
that speech was given to man, not that men might therewith deceive
one another, but that one man might make known his thoughts to
another. To use speech, then, for the purpose of deception, and not
for its appointed end, is a sin. Nor are we to suppose that there
is any lie that is not a sin, because it is sometimes possible, by
telling a lie, to do service to another. For it is possible to do
this by theft also, as when we steal from a rich man who never
feels the loss, to give to a poor man who is sensibly benefited by
what he gets. And the same can be said of adultery also, when, for
instance, some woman appears likely to die of love unless we
consent to her wishes, while if she lived she might purify herself
by repentance; but yet no one will assert that on this account such
an adultery is not a sin. And if we justly place so high a value
upon chastity, what offense have we taken at truth, that, while no
prospect of advantage to another will lead us to violate the former
by adultery, we should be ready to violate the latter by lying? It
cannot be denied that they have attained a very high standard of
goodness who never lie except to save a man from injury; but in the
case of men who have reached this standard, it is not the deceit,
but their good intention, that is justly praised, and sometimes
even rewarded. It is quite enough that the deception should be
pardoned, without its being made an object of laudation, especially
among the heirs of the new covenant, to whom it is said: &#8220;Let

think there cannot now be any doubt, that the only cause of any

whole mass of the human race was under condemnation, was lying
steeped and wallowing in misery, and was being tossed from one form
of evil to another, and, having joined the faction of the fallen
angels, was paying the well-merited penalty of that impious
rebellion. For whatever the wicked freely do through blind and
unbridled lust, and whatever they suffer against their will in the
way of open punishment, this all evidently pertains to the just
wrath of God. But the goodness of the Creator never fails either to
supply life and vital power to the wicked angels (without which
their existence would soon come to an end); or, in the case of
mankind, who spring from a condemned and corrupt stock, to impart
form and life to their seed, to fashion their members, and through
the various seasons of their life, and in the different parts of
the earth, to quicken their senses, and bestow upon them the
nourishment they need. For He judged it better to bring good out of
evil, than not to permit any evil to exist. And if He had
determined that in the case of men, as in the case of the fallen
angels, there should be no restoration to happiness, would it not
have been quite just, that the being who rebelled against God, who
in the abuse of his freedom spurned and transgressed the command of
his Creator when he could so easily have kept it, who defaced in
himself the image of his Creator by stubbornly turning away from
His light, who by an evil use of his free-will broke away from his
wholesome bondage to the Creator&#8217;s laws,&#8212;would it not have been
just that such a being should have been wholly and to all eternity
deserted by God, and left to suffer the everlasting punishment he
had so richly earned? Certainly so God would have done, had He been
only just and not also merciful, and had He not designed that His
unmerited mercy should shine forth the more brightly in contrast
with the unworthiness of its objects.</p>

and so made subject to the penalty which one had incurred; but when
he, who afterwards became the devil, was with his associates in
crime exalted in pride, and by that very exaltation was with them

And hence he will not be free to do right, until, being freed from
sin, he shall begin to be the servant of righteousness. And this is
true liberty, for he has pleasure in the righteous deed; and it is
at the same time a holy bondage, for he is obedient to the will of
God. But whence comes this liberty to do right to the man who is in

we are to understand the saying, &#8220;It is not of him that willeth,
nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy,&#8221; as if it
meant the will of man alone is not sufficient, if the mercy of God
go not with it,&#8212;then it will follow that the mercy of God alone
is not sufficient, if the will of man go not with it; and
therefore, if we may rightly say, &#8220;it is not of man that willeth,
but of God that showeth mercy,&#8221; because the will of man by itself
is not enough, why may we not also rightly put it in the converse
way: &#8220;It is not of God that showeth mercy, but of man that
willeth,&#8221; because the mercy of God by itself does not suffice?
Surely, if no Christian will dare to say this, &#8220;It is not of God
that showeth mercy, but of man that willeth,&#8221; lest he should
openly contradict the apostle, it follows that the true
interpretation of the saying, &#8220;It is not of him that willeth, nor
of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy,&#8221; is that the
whole work belongs to God, who both makes the will of man
righteous, and thus prepares it for assistance, and assists it when
it is prepared. For the man&#8217;s righteousness of will precedes many
of God&#8217;s gifts, but not all; and it must itself be included among
those which it does not precede. We read in Holy Scripture, both

guilt is washed away in regeneration; but such as it behoved a
virgin to bring forth, when the mother&#8217;s faith, not her lust, was
the condition of conception. And if her virginity had been marred
even in bringing Him forth, He would not have been born of a
virgin; and it would be false (which God forbid) that He was born
of the Virgin Mary, as is believed and declared by the whole
Church, which, in imitation of His mother, daily brings forth
members of His body, and yet remains a virgin. Read, if you please,

because in His one person the Word was joined with a body and a
rational soul. Wherefore, so far as He is God, He and the Father
are one; so far as He is man, the Father is greater than He. For
when He was the only Son of God, not by grace, but by nature, that
He might be also full of grace, He became the Son of man; and He
Himself unites both natures in His own identity, and both natures
constitute one Christ; because, &#8220;being in the form of God, He

made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Himself the form of a
servant, not losing or lessening the form of God. And, accordingly,
He was both made less and remained equal, being both in one, as has
been said: but He was one of these as Word, and the other as man.
As Word, He is equal with the Father; as man, less than the Father.
One Son of God, and at the same time Son of man; one Son of man,

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.xxxviii-p2">Now here the grace of God is
displayed with the greatest power and clearness. For what merit had
the human nature in the man Christ earned, that it should in this
unparalleled way be taken up into the unity of the person of the
only Son of God? What goodness of will, what goodness of desire and
intention, what good works, had gone before, which made this man
worthy to become one person with God? Had He been a man previously
to this, and had He earned this unprecedented reward, that He
should be thought worthy to become God? Assuredly <pb n="250" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_250.html" id="iv.ii.xxxviii-Page_250"/>nay; from
the very moment that He began to be man, He was nothing else than
the Son of God, the only Son of God, the Word who was made flesh,
and therefore He was God so that just as each individual man unites
in one person a body and a rational soul, so Christ in one person
unites the Word and man. Now wherefore was this unheard of glory
conferred on human nature,&#8212;a glory which, as there was no
antecedent merit, was of course wholly of grace,&#8212;except that here
those who looked at the matter soberly and honestly might behold a
clear manifestation of the power of God&#8217;s free grace, and might
understand that they are justified from their sins by the same
grace which made the man Christ Jesus free from the possibility of
sin? And so the angel, when he announced to Christ&#8217;s mother the

after saying, &#8220;The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,&#8221;

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.xl-p2">Nevertheless, are we on this
account to say that the Holy Ghost is the father of the man Christ,
and that as God the Father begat the Word, so God the Holy Spirit

His father begat Him of the Virgin Mary? Who will dare to say so?
Nor is it necessary to show by reasoning how many other absurdities
flow from this supposition, when it is itself so absurd that no
believer&#8217;s ears can bear to hear it. Hence, as we confess, &#8220;Our
Lord Jesus Christ, who of God is God, and as man was born of the
Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, having both natures, the divine
and the human, is the only Son of God the Father Almighty, from

that created thing which the Virgin conceived and brought forth
though it was united only to the person of the Son, was made by the
whole Trinity (for the works of the Trinity are not separable), why
should the Holy Spirit alone be mentioned as having made it? Or is
it that, when one of the Three is mentioned as the author of any
work, the whole Trinity is to be understood as working? That is
true, and can be proved by examples. But we need not dwell longer
on this <pb n="251" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_251.html" id="iv.ii.xl-Page_251"/>solution. For the puzzle is, in what sense it is said,
&#8220;born of the Holy Ghost,&#8221; when He is in no sense the Son of the
Holy Ghost? For though God made this world, it would not be right
to say that it is the Son of God, or that it was born of God; we
would say that it was created, or made, or framed, or ordered by
Him, or whatever form of expression we can properly use. Here,
then, when we make confession that Christ was born of the Holy
Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, it is difficult to explain how it is
that He is not the Son of the Holy Ghost and is the Son of the
Virgin Mary, when He was born both of Him and of her. It is clear
beyond a doubt that He was not born of the Holy Spirit as His
father, in the same sense that He was born of the Virgin as His
mother.</p>

granted, that whatever is born of a thing is forthwith to be
declared the son of that thing. For, to pass over the fact that a
son is born of a man in a different sense from that in which a hair
or a louse is born of him, neither of these being a son; to pass
over this, I say, as too mean an illustration for a subject of so
much importance: it is certain that those who are born of water and
of the Holy Spirit cannot with propriety be called sons of the
water though they are called sons of God the Father, and of the
Church their mother. In the same way, then, He who was born of the
Holy Spirit is the Son of God the Father, not of the Holy Spirit.
For what I have said of the hair and the other things is sufficient
to show us that not everything which is born of another can be
called the son of that of which it is born, just as it does not
follow that all who are called a man&#8217;s sons were born of him, for
some sons are adopted. And some men are called sons of hell, not as
being born of hell, but as prepared for it, as the sons of the
kingdom are prepared for the kingdom.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.xlii-p2">And, therefore, as one thing may be
born of another, and yet not in such a way as to be its son, and as
not every one who is called a son was born of him whose son he is
called, it is clear that this arrangement by which Christ was born
of the Holy Spirit, but not as His son, and of the Virgin Mary as
her son, is intended as a manifestation of the grace of God. For it
was by this grace that a man, without any antecedent merit, was at
the very commencement of His existence as man, so united in one
person with the Word of God, that the very person who was Son of
man was at the same time Son of God, and the very person who was
Son of God was at the same time Son of man; and in the adoption of
His human nature into the divine, the grace itself became in a way
so natural to the man, as to leave no room for the entrance of sin.
Wherefore this grace is signified by the Holy Spirit; for He,
though in His own nature God, may also be called the gift of God.
And to explain all this sufficiently, if indeed it could be done at
all, would require a very lengthened discussion.</p>

time on which He was baptized, but to the one day of an
unchangeable eternity, so as to show that this man was one in
person with the Only-begotten. For when a day neither begins with
the close of yesterday, nor ends with the beginning of to-morrow,
it is an eternal to-day. Therefore He asked to be baptized in water
by John, not that any iniquity of His might be washed away, but
that He might manifest the depth of His humility. For baptism found
in Him nothing to wash away, as death found in Him nothing to
punish; so that it was in the strictest justice, and not by the
mere violence of power, that the devil was crushed and conquered:
for, as he had most unjustly put Christ to death, though there was
no sin in Him to deserve death, it was most just that through
Christ he should lose his hold of those who by sin were justly
subject to the bondage in which he held them. Both of these, then,
that is, both baptism and death, were submitted to by Him, not
through a pitiable necessity, but of His own free pity for us, and
as part of an arrangement by which, as one man brought sin into the
world, that is, upon the whole human race, so one man was to take
away the sin of the world.</p>

brought one sin into the world, but this man took away not only

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.liv-p2">And after he has said as much about
the condemnation through one man, and the free gift through one
man, as he deemed sufficient for that part of his epistle, the
apostle goes on to speak of the great mystery of holy baptism in
the cross of Christ, and to clearly explain to us that baptism in
Christ is nothing else than a similitude of the death of Christ,
and that the death of Christ on the cross is nothing but a
similitude of the pardon of sin: so that just as real as is His
death, so real is the remission of our sins; and just as real as is
His resurrection, so real is our justification. He says: &#8220;What
shall we say, then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may
abound?&#8221;<note place="end" n="1176" id="iv.ii.liv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.liv-p3"> <scripRef passage="Rom. vi. 1" id="iv.ii.liv-p3.2" parsed="|Rom|6|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.6.1">Rom. vi. 1</scripRef></p></note> For he had
said previously, &#8220;But where sin, abounded, grace did much more
abound.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1177" id="iv.ii.liv-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.liv-p4"> <scripRef passage="Rom. v. 20" id="iv.ii.liv-p4.2" parsed="|Rom|5|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.5.20">Rom. v. 20</scripRef></p></note> And
therefore he proposes to himself the question, whether it would be
right to continue in sin for the sake of the consequent abounding
grace. But he answers, &#8220;God forbid;&#8221; and adds, &#8220;How shall we,
that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?&#8221; Then, to show
that we are dead to sin, &#8220;Know ye not,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that so
many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into
His death?&#8221; If, then, the fact that we were baptized into the
death of Christ proves that we are dead to sin, it follows that
even infants who are baptized into Christ die to sin, being
baptized into His death. For there is no exception made: &#8220;So many
of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into His
death.&#8221; And this is said to prove that we are dead to sin. Now,
to what sin do infants die in their regeneration but that sin which
they bring with them at birth? And therefore to these also applies
what follows: &#8220;Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into
death; that, like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the
glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of
life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His
death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection:
knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body
of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.
For he that is dead is freed from sin. Now if we be dead with
Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him: knowing that
Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no
more dominion over Him. For in that He died, He died unto sin once;
but in that He liveth, He liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also
yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through
Jesus Christ our Lord.&#8221; Now he had commenced with proving that we
must not continue in sin that grace may abound, and had said:
&#8220;How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein?&#8221;
And to show that we are dead to sin, he added: &#8220;Know ye not, that
so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized
into His death?&#8221; And so he concludes this whole passage just as
he began it. For he has brought in the death of Christ in such a
way as to imply that Christ Himself also died to sin. To what sin
did He die if not to the flesh, in which there was not sin, but the
likeness of sin, and which was therefore called by the name of sin?
To those who are baptized into the death of Christ, then,&#8212;and
this class includes not adults only, but infants as well,&#8212;he
says: &#8220;Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto
sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1178" id="iv.ii.liv-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.liv-p5"> <scripRef passage="Rom. vi. 1-11" id="iv.ii.liv-p5.2" parsed="|Rom|6|1|6|11" osisRef="Bible:Rom.6.1-Rom.6.11">Rom. vi. 1&#8211;11</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.lvii-p2">Now the expression, &#8220;to judge the

unrighteous; for the righteous shall be judged as well as others.

Christ, the only Son of God, our Lord, with the brevity suitable to

the Holy Ghost,&#8212;thus completing the Trinity which constitutes the

be subordinate in the order of speech to the Creator, the Supreme
Trinity: for all that is said of the man Christ Jesus has
reference, of course, to the unity of the person of the
Only-begotten. Therefore the true order of the Creed demanded that
the Church should be made subordinate to the Trinity, as the house
to Him who dwells in it, the temple to God who occupies it, and the
city to its builder. And we are here to understand the whole
Church, not that part of it only which wanders as a stranger on the
earth, praising the name of God from the rising of the sun to the
going down of the same, and singing a new song of deliverance from
its old captivity; but that part also which has always from its
creation remained steadfast to God in heaven, and has never
experienced the misery consequent upon a fall. This part is made up
of the holy angels, who enjoy uninterrupted happiness; and (as it
is bound to do) it renders assistance to the part which is still
wandering among strangers: for these two parts shall be one in the
fellowship of eternity, and now they are one in the bonds of love,
the whole having been ordained for the worship of the one God.
Wherefore, neither the whole Church, nor any part of it, has any
desire to be worshipped instead of God, nor to be God to any one
who belongs to the temple of God&#8212;that temple which is built up of
the saints who were created by the uncreated God. And therefore the
Holy Spirit, if a creature, could not be the Creator, but would be
a part <pb n="256" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_256.html" id="iv.ii.lviii-Page_256"/>of the intelligent creation. He would simply be the
highest creature, and therefore would not be mentioned in the Creed
before the Church; for He Himself would belong to the Church, to
that part of it which is in the heavens. And He would not have a
temple, for He Himself would be part of a temple. Now He has a
temple, of which the apostle says: &#8220;Know ye not that your body is

for every rational creature which is happy derives its happiness
from Him; He does not derive His from it. And in this view it is
better to interpret &#8220;all&#8221; in the passage, &#8220;The peace of God
passeth all understanding,&#8221; as admitting of no exception even in
favor of the understanding of the holy angels: the only exception
that can be made is that of God Himself. For, of course, His peace

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.lxvi-p2">But the angels even now are at
peace with us when our sins are pardoned. Hence, in the order of
the Creed, after the mention of the Holy Church is placed the
remission of sins. For it is by this that the Church on earth
stands: it is through this that what had been lost, and was found,
is saved from being lost again. For, setting aside the grace of
baptism, which is given as an antidote to original sin, so that
what our birth imposes upon us, our new birth relieves us from
(this grace, however, takes away all the actual sins also that have
been committed in thought, word, and deed): setting aside, then,
this great act of favor, whence commences man&#8217;s restoration, and
in which all our guilt, both original and actual, is washed away,
the rest of our life from the time that we have the use of reason
provides constant occasion for the remission of sins, however great
may be our advance in righteousness. For the sons of God, as long
as they live in this body of death, are in conflict with death. And
although it is truly said of them, &#8220;As many as are led by the

under the influence of human affections, they fall back to their
old level, and so sin. There is a difference, however. For although
every crime is a sin, every sin is not a crime. And so we say that
the life of holy men, as long as they remain in this mortal body,
may be found without crime; but, as the Apostle John says, &#8220;If we
say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.lxviii-p2">Now the pardon of sin has reference
chiefly to the future judgment. For, as far as this life is
concerned, the saying of Scripture holds good: &#8220;A heavy yoke is

see even infants, after baptism and regeneration, suffering from
the infliction of divers evils: and thus we are given to
understand, that all that is set forth in the sacraments of
salvation refers rather to the hope of future good, than to the
retaining or attaining of present blessings. For many sins seem in
this world to be overlooked and visited with no punishment, whose
punishment is reserved for the future (for it is not in vain that
the day when Christ shall come as Judge of quick and dead is
peculiarly named the day of judgment); just as, on the other hand,
many sins are punished in this life, which nevertheless are
pardoned, and shall bring down no punishment in the future life.
Accordingly, in reference to certain temporal punishments, which in
this life are visited upon sinners, the apostle, addressing those
whose sins are <pb n="259" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_259.html" id="iv.ii.lxviii-Page_259"/>blotted out, and not reserved

nor redeem it by almsgiving, but persevere in it persistently to
the last day of their lives, shall be saved by fire; that is, that
although they shall suffer a punishment by fire, lasting for a time
proportionate to the magnitude of their crimes and misdeeds, they
shall not be punished with everlasting fire. But those who believe
this, and yet are Catholics, seem to me to be led astray by a kind
of benevolent feeling natural to humanity. For Holy Scripture, when
consulted, gives a very different answer. I have written a book on
this subject, entitled <i>Of Faith and Works</i>, in which, to the
best of my ability, God assisting me, I have shown from Scripture,

conflict with the plain statements quoted above. Now wood, hay, and
stubble may, without incongruity, be understood to signify such an
attachment to worldly things, however lawful these may be in
themselves, that they cannot be lost without grief of mind. And
though this grief burns, yet if Christ hold the place of foundation
in the heart,&#8212;that is, if nothing be preferred to Him, and if the
man, though burning with grief, is yet more willing to lose the
things he loves so much than to lose Christ,&#8212;he is saved by fire.
If, however, in time of temptation, he prefer to hold by temporal
and earthly things rather than by Christ, he has not Christ as his
foundation; for he puts earthly things in the first place, and in a
building nothing comes before the foundation. Again, the fire of
which the apostle speaks in this place must be such a fire as both
men are made to pass through, that is, both the man who builds upon
the foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, and the man who
builds wood, hay, stubble. For he immediately adds: &#8220;The fire
shall try every man&#8217;s work, of what sort it is. If any man&#8217;s

burned, because he has not given his love to things whose loss can

But since, by our supposition, even the latter prefers to lose
these things rather than to lose Christ, and since he does not
desert Christ out of fear of losing them, though he is grieved when
he does lose them, he is saved, but it is so as by fire; because
the grief for what he loved and has lost burns him. But it does not

every useful act that a man does in mercy. Not only, then, the man

puts the wanderer on the right path, gives advice to the perplexed,
and supplies the wants of the needy,&#8212;not this man only, but the
man who pardons the sinner also gives alms; and the man who
corrects with blows, or restrains by any kind of discipline one
over whom he has power, and who at the same time forgives from the
heart the sin by which he was injured, or prays that it may be
forgiven, is also a giver of alms, not only in that he forgives, or
prays for forgiveness for the sin, but also in that he rebukes and
corrects the sinner: for in this, too, he shows mercy. Now much
good is bestowed upon unwilling recipients, when their advantage

to forgive from the heart a sin that has been committed against us.
For it is a comparatively small thing to wish well to, or even to
do good to, a man who has done no evil to you. It is a much higher
thing, and is the result of the most exalted goodness, to love your
enemy, and always to wish well to, and when you have the
opportunity, to do good to, the man who wishes you ill, and, when
he can, does you harm. This is to obey the command of God: &#8220;Love
your enemies, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them

mind only reached by the perfect sons of God, and that though every

standard, yet a degree of goodness so high can hardly belong to so
great a multitude as we believe are heard when they use this

view of all this, it cannot be doubted that the implied undertaking
is fulfilled if a man, though he has not yet attained to loving his
enemy, yet, when asked by one who has sinned against him to forgive
him his sin, does forgive him from his heart. For he certainly
desires to be himself forgiven when he prays, &#8220;as we forgive our

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.lxxviii-p2">For the man who wishes to give aims
as he ought, should begin with himself, and give to himself first.

again, that we should be pleasing to God, who is justly displeased
with that which we brought with us when we were born. This is our
first alms, which we give to ourselves when, through the mercy of a
pitying God, we find that we are ourselves wretched, and confess
the justice of His judgment by which we are made wretched, of which
the apostle says, &#8220;The judgment was by one to condemnation;&#8221;<note place="end" n="1242" id="iv.ii.lxxviii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.lxxviii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Rom. v. 16" id="iv.ii.lxxviii-p4.2" parsed="|Rom|5|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.5.16">Rom. v. 16</scripRef></p></note> and praise

misery, and loving God with the love which He has Himself bestowed,
we lead a holy and virtuous life. But the Pharisees, while they
gave as alms the tithe of all their fruits, even the most
insignificant, passed over judgment and the love of God, and so did
not commence their alms-giving at home, and extend their pity to
themselves in the first instance. And it is in reference to this

<span class="c2" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p1.1">Chapter
78.&#8212;What Sins are Trivial and What Heinous is a Matter for

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p2">Now, what sins are trivial and what
heinous is not a matter to be decided by man&#8217;s judgment, but by
the judgment of God. For it is plain that the apostles themselves
have given an indulgence in the case of certain sins: take, for
example, what the Apostle Paul says to those who are married:
&#8220;Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a
time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer: and come
together again, that <pb n="263" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_263.html" id="iv.ii.lxxx-Page_263"/>Satan tempt you not for your
incontinency.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1250" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 5" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|7|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.5">1 Cor. vii. 5</scripRef></p></note> Now it is possible that it might
not have been considered a sin to have intercourse with a spouse,
not with a view to the procreation of children, which is the great
blessing of marriage, but for the sake of carnal pleasure, and to
save the incontinent from being led by their weakness into the
deadly sin of fornication, or adultery, or another form of
uncleanness which it is shameful even to name, and into which it is
possible that they might be drawn by lust under the temptation of
Satan. It is possible, I say, that this might not have been
considered a sin, had the apostle not added: &#8220;But I speak this by
permission, and not of commandment.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1251" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p4"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 6" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p4.2" parsed="|1Cor|7|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.6">1 Cor. vii. 6</scripRef>.
[&#8220;Concession,&#8221; R.V.]</p></note> Who, then, can deny that it is a
sin, when confessedly it is only by apostolic authority that
permission is granted to those who do it? Another case of the same
kind is where he says: &#8220;Dare any of you, having a matter against
another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the
saints?&#8221;<note place="end" n="1252" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 1" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p5.2" parsed="|1Cor|6|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.1">1 Cor. vi. 1</scripRef></p></note> And
shortly afterwards: &#8220;If then ye have judgments of things
pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed
in the Church. I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a
wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between
his brethren? But brother goeth to law with brother, and that
before the unbelievers.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1253" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p6"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 4-6" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p6.2" parsed="|1Cor|6|4|6|6" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.4-1Cor.6.6">1 Cor. vi. 4&#8211;6</scripRef></p></note> Now it might have been supposed in
this case that it is not a sin to have a quarrel with another, that
the only sin is in wishing to have it adjudicated upon outside the
Church, had not the apostle immediately added: &#8220;Now therefore
there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law with one
another.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1254" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p7"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 7" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p7.2" parsed="|1Cor|6|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.7">1 Cor. vi. 7</scripRef></p></note> And lest
any one should excuse himself by saying that he had a just cause,
and was suffering wrong, and that he only wished the sentence of
the judges to remove his wrong, the apostle immediately anticipates
such thoughts and excuses, and says: &#8220;Why do ye not rather take
wrong? Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?&#8221;
Thus bringing us back to our Lord&#8217;s saying, &#8220;If any man will
sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak
also;&#8221;<note place="end" n="1255" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p8"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 5.40" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p8.1" parsed="|Matt|5|40|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.40">Matt. v. 40</scripRef></p></note> and again,

our Lord has forbidden His followers to go to law with other men
about worldly affairs. And carrying out this principle, the apostle
here declares that to do so is &#8220;altogether a fault.&#8221; But when,
notwithstanding, he grants his permission to have such cases
between brethren decided in the Church, other brethren
adjudicating, and only sternly forbids them to be carried outside
the Church, it is manifest that here again an indulgence is
extended to the infirmities of the weak. It is in view, then, of
these sins, and others of the same sort, and of others again more
trifling still, which consist of offenses in words and thought (as
the Apostle James confesses, &#8220;In many things we offend all&#8221;<note place="end" n="1257" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p9.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p10"> <scripRef passage="Jas. iii. 2" id="iv.ii.lxxx-p10.2" parsed="|Jas|3|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jas.3.2">Jas. iii. 2</scripRef>. [See

need to pray every day and often to the Lord, saying, &#8220;Forgive us
our debts,&#8221; and to add in truth and sincerity, &#8220;as we forgive

bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother

these cities crimes were not only not punished, but were openly
committed, as if under the protection of the law. And so in our own
times: many forms of sin, though not just the same as those of Sodom
and Gomorrah, are now so openly and habitually practised, that not
only dare we not excommunicate a layman, we dare not even degrade a
clergyman, for the commission of them. So that when, a few years
ago, I was expounding the Epistle to the Galatians, in commenting
on that very place where the apostle says, &#8220;I am afraid of you,
lest I have bestowed labor upon you in vain,&#8221; I was compelled to
exclaim, &#8220;Woe to the sins of men! for it is only when we are not
accustomed to them that we shrink from them: when once we are
accustomed to them, though the blood of the Son of God was poured
out to wash them away, though they are so great that the kingdom of
God is wholly shut against them, constant familiarity leads to the
toleration of them all, and habitual toleration leads to the
practice of many of them. And grant, O Lord, that we may not come
to practise all that we have not the power to hinder.&#8221; But I
shall see whether the extravagance of grief did not betray me into
rashness of speech.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.lxxxiii-p2">I shall now say this, which I have
often said before in other places of my works. There are two causes
that lead to sin: either we do not yet know our duty, or we do not
perform the duty that we know. The former is the sin of ignorance,
the latter of weakness. Now against these it is our duty to
struggle; but we shall certainly be beaten in the fight, unless we
are helped by God, not only to see our duty, but also, when we
clearly see it, to make the love of righteousness stronger in us
than the love of earthly things, the eager longing after which, or
the fear of losing which, leads us with our eyes open into known
sin. In the latter case we are not only sinners, for we are so even
when we err through ignorance, but we are also transgressors of the
law; for we leave undone what we know we ought to do, and we do
what we know we ought not to do. Wherefore not only ought we to
pray for pardon when we have sinned, saying, &#8220;Forgive us our
debts, as we forgive our debtors;&#8221; but we ought to pray for
guidance, that we may be kept from sinning, saying, &#8220;and lead us
not into temptation.&#8221; And we are to pray to Him of whom the

as the body of Christ Himself rose again,&#8212;I do not see how I can

question about abortive conceptions, which have indeed been born in
the mother&#8217;s womb, but not so born that they could be born again.
For if we shall decide that these are to rise again, we cannot
object to any conclusion that may be drawn in regard to those which
are fully formed. Now who is there that is not rather disposed to
think that unformed abortions perish, like seeds that have never
fructified? But who will dare to deny, though he may not dare to
affirm, that at the resurrection every defect in the form shall be
supplied, and that thus the perfection which time would have
brought shall not be wanting, any more than the blemishes which
time did bring shall be present: so that the nature shall neither
want anything suitable and in harmony with it that length of days
would have added, nor be debased by the presence of anything of an
opposite kind that length of days has added; but that what is not
yet complete shall be completed, just as what has been injured
shall be renewed.</p>

resolve it: At what time the infant begins to live in the womb:
whether life exists in a latent form before it manifests itself in
the motions of the living being. To deny that the young who are cut
out limb by limb from the womb, lest if they were left there dead
the mother should die too, have never been alive, seems too
audacious. Now, from the time that a man begins to live, from that
time it is possible for him to die. And if he die, wheresoever
death may overtake him, I cannot discover on what principle he can
be denied an interest in the resurrection of the dead.</p>

which, because they have either a superfluity or a defect, or
because they are very much deformed, are called <i>

For otherwise, to suppose that the hair recovers all that our
frequent clippings and shavings have taken away from it, and the
nails all that we have so often pared off, presents to the
imagination such a picture of ugliness and deformity, as to make
the resurrection of the body all but incredible. But just as if a

would make no difference to the completeness of the work what part

long as the restored statue contained all the material of the
original one; so God, the Artificer of marvellous and unspeakable
power, shall with marvellous and unspeakable rapidity restore our
body, using up the whole material of which it originally consisted.
Nor will it affect the completeness of its restoration whether
hairs return to hairs, and nails to nails, or whether the part of

while in regard to other bodily advantages all should be equal,
then the material of which each is composed may be so modified that
none of it shall be lost, and that any defect may be supplied by
Him who can create at His will out of nothing. But if in the bodies
of those who rise again there shall be a well-ordered inequality,
such as there is in the voices that make up a full harmony, then
the material of each man&#8217;s body shall be so dealt with that it

refuse to permit what He does not wish, as bring about what He does
wish. And if we do not believe this, the very first sentence of our

This, indeed cannot be said of infants, for it is not in their
power either to will or not to will. But if we could attribute to
their will the childish movements they make at baptism, when they
make all the resistance they can, we should say that even they are
not willing to be saved. Our Lord says plainly, however, in the
Gospel, when upbraiding the impious city: &#8220;How often would I have
gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her
chickens under her wings, and ye would not!&#8221;<note place="end" n="1278" id="iv.ii.xcix-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.xcix-p4"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 23.37" id="iv.ii.xcix-p4.1" parsed="|Matt|23|37|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.37">Matt. xxiii. 37</scripRef></p></note> as if the will of God had been
overcome by the will of men, and when the weakest stood in the way
with their want of will, the will of the strongest could not be
carried out. And where is that omnipotence which hath done all that
it pleased on earth and in heaven, if God willed to gather together
the children of Jerusalem, and did not accomplish it? or rather,
Jerusalem was not willing that her children should be gathered
together? But even though she was unwilling, He gathered together
as many of her children as He wished: for He does not will some
things and do them, and will others and do them not; but &#8220;He hath
done all that He pleased in heaven and in earth.&#8221;</p>

was illustrating the grace of God, in connection with which he had

said might affect those who could not penetrate by their
understanding the depth of this grace: &#8220;What shall we say
then?&#8221; he says: &#8220;Is there unrighteousness with God? God
forbid.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1282" id="iv.ii.c-p5.4"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.c-p6"> <scripRef passage="Rom. ix. 14" id="iv.ii.c-p6.2" parsed="|Rom|9|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.9.14">Rom. ix. 14</scripRef></p></note> For it
seems unjust that, in the absence of any merit or demerit, from
good or evil works, God should love the one and hate the other.
Now, if the apostle had wished us to understand that there were
future good works of the one, and evil works of the other, which of
course God foreknew, he would never have said, &#8220;not of works,&#8221;
but, &#8220;of future works,&#8221; and in that way would have solved the
difficulty, or rather there would then have been no difficulty to
solve. As it is, however, after answering, &#8220;God forbid;&#8221; that
is, God forbid that there should be unrighteousness with God; he
goes on to prove that there is no unrighteousness in God&#8217;s doing
this, and says: &#8220;For He saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom
I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have
compassion.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1283" id="iv.ii.c-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.c-p7"> <scripRef passage="Rom. ix. 15" id="iv.ii.c-p7.2" parsed="|Rom|9|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.9.15">Rom. ix. 15</scripRef>; <scripRef passage="Ex. xxxiii. 19" id="iv.ii.c-p7.3" parsed="|Exod|33|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.33.19">Ex. xxxiii.

but a fool would think that God was unrighteous, either in
inflicting penal justice on those who had earned it, or in
extending mercy to the unworthy? Then he draws his conclusion:
&#8220;So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
but of God that showeth mercy.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1284" id="iv.ii.c-p7.4"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.c-p8"> <scripRef passage="Rom. ix. 16" id="iv.ii.c-p8.2" parsed="|Rom|9|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.9.16">Rom. ix. 16</scripRef>. [See R
V.]</p></note> Thus both the twins were born
children of wrath, not on account of any works of their own, but
because they were bound in the fetters of that original
condemnation which came through Adam. But He who said, &#8220;I will
have mercy on whom I will have mercy,&#8221; loved Jacob of His
undeserved grace, and hated Esau of His deserved judgment. And as
this judgment was due to both, the former learnt from the case of
the latter that the fact of the same punishment not falling upon
himself gave him no room to glory in any merit of his own, but only
in the riches of the divine grace; because &#8220;it is not of him that
willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.&#8221;
And indeed the whole face, and, if I may use the expression, every
lineament of the countenance of Scripture conveys by a very
profound analogy this wholesome warning to every one who looks
carefully into it, that he who glories should glory in the Lord.<note place="end" n="1285" id="iv.ii.c-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.c-p9"> Comp.

that applies to both, that is, both to His mercy and His justice:

is condemned complain of anything but his own demerit. For it is
grace alone that separates the redeemed from the lost, all having
been involved in one common perdition through their common origin.

for being bad, because God hath mercy on whom He will have mercy,

to answer as we see the apostle answered: &#8220;Nay, but, O man, who
art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to
Him that formed it, Why hast Thou made me thus? Hath not the potter

that in this place the apostle had no answer to give; and for want

But there is great weight in this saying: &#8220;Nay, but, O man, who
art thou?&#8221; and in such a matter as this it suggests to a man in a
single word the limits of his capacity, and at the same time does
in reality convey an important reason. For if a man does not
understand these matters, who is he that he should reply against
God? And if he does understand them, he finds no further room for
reply. For then he perceives that the whole human race was
condemned in its rebellious head by a divine judgment so just, that
if not a single member of the race had been redeemed, no one could
justly have questioned the justice of God; and that it was right
that those who are redeemed should be redeemed in such a way as to
show, by the greater number who are unredeemed and left in their
just condemnation, what the whole race deserved, and whither the
deserved judgment of God would lead even the redeemed, did not His
undeserved mercy interpose, so that every mouth might be stopped of
those who wish to glory in their own merits, and that he that
glorieth might glory in the Lord.<note place="end" n="1290" id="iv.ii.ci-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.ci-p7"> <scripRef passage="Rom. iii. 19" id="iv.ii.ci-p7.2" parsed="|Rom|3|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.3.19">Rom. iii. 19</scripRef>; <scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 31" id="iv.ii.ci-p7.3" parsed="|1Cor|1|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.31">1 Cor. i.

when the intelligent creation, both angelic and human, sinned,
doing not His will but their own, He used the very will of the
creature which was working in opposition to the Creator&#8217;s will as
an instrument for carrying out His will, the supremely Good thus
turning to good account even what is evil, to the condemnation of
those whom in His justice He has predestined to punishment, and to
the salvation of those whom in His mercy He has predestined to
grace. For, as far as relates to their own consciousness, these
creatures did what God wished not to be done: but in view of
God&#8217;s omnipotence, they could in no wise effect their purpose.
For in the very fact that they acted in opposition to His will, His
will concerning them was fulfilled. And hence it is that &#8220;the
works of the Lord are great, sought out according to all His
pleasure,&#8221; because in a way unspeakably strange and wonderful,
even what is done in opposition to His will does not defeat His
will. For it would not be done did He not permit it (and of course
His permission is not unwilling, but willing); nor would a Good
Being permit evil to be done only that in His omnipotence He can
turn evil into good.</p>

Sometimes Fulfilled Through the Evil Will of Man.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.ciii-p2">Sometimes, however, a man in the
goodness of his will desires something that God does not desire,
even though God&#8217;s will is also good, nay, much more fully and
more surely good (for His will never can be evil): for example, if
a good son is anxious that his father should live, when it is
God&#8217;s good will that he should die. Again, it is possible for a
man with evil will to desire what God wills in His goodness: for
example, if a bad son wishes his father to die, when this is also
the will of God. It is plain that the former wishes what God does
not wish, and that the latter wishes what God does wish; and yet
the filial love of the former is more in harmony with the good will
of God, though its desire is different from God&#8217;s, than the want
of filial <pb n="270" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_270.html" id="iv.ii.ciii-Page_270"/>affection of the latter, though its desire is the same
as God&#8217;s. So necessary is it, in determining whether a man&#8217;s
desire is one to be approved or disapproved, to consider what it is
proper for man, and what it is proper for God, to desire, and what
is in each case the real motive of the will. For God accomplishes
some of His purposes, which of course are all good, through the
evil desires of wicked men: for example, it was through the wicked
designs of the Jews, working out the good purpose of the Father,
that Christ was slain and this event was so truly good, that when
the Apostle Peter expressed his unwillingness that it should take
place, he was designated Satan by Him who had come to be slain.<note place="end" n="1292" id="iv.ii.ciii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.ciii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 16.21-23" id="iv.ii.ciii-p3.1" parsed="|Matt|16|21|16|23" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.21-Matt.16.23">Matt. xvi. 21&#8211;23</scripRef></p></note> How good

that he should suffer these evils for preaching the faith of
Christ, and thereby become a witness for Christ. And this purpose
of His, which was good, God did not fulfill through the good
counsels of the Christians, but through the evil counsels of the
Jews; so that those who opposed His purpose were more truly His
servants than those who were the willing instruments of its
accomplishment.</p>

that no man is saved unless God wills his salvation: not that there
is no man whose salvation He does not will, but that no man is
saved apart from His will; and that, therefore, we should pray Him
to will our salvation, because if He will it, it must necessarily
be accomplished. And it was of prayer to God that the apostle was
speaking when he used this expression. And on the same principle we
interpret the expression in the Gospel: &#8220;The true light which
lighteth every man that cometh into the world:&#8221;<note place="end" n="1295" id="iv.ii.cv-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.cv-p4"> <scripRef passage="John i. 9" id="iv.ii.cv-p4.2" parsed="|John|1|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.9">John i. 9</scripRef></p></note> not that
there is no man who is not enlightened, but that no man is
enlightened except by Him. Or, it is said, &#8220;Who will have all men
to be saved;&#8221; not that there is no man whose salvation He does
not will (for how, then, explain the fact that He was unwilling to
work miracles in the presence of some who, He said, would have
repented if He had worked them?), but that we are to understand by
&#8220;all men,&#8221; the human race in all its varieties of rank and
circumstances,&#8212;kings, subjects; noble, plebeian, high, low,
learned, and unlearned; the sound in body, the feeble, the clever,
the dull, the foolish, the rich, the poor, and those of middling
circumstances; males, females, infants, boys, youths; young,
middle-aged, and old men; of every tongue, of every fashion, of all
arts, of all professions, with all the innumerable differences of
will and conscience, and whatever else there is that makes a
distinction among men. For which of all these classes is there out
of which God does not will that men should be saved in all nations
through His only-begotten Son, our Lord, and therefore does save
them; for the Omnipotent cannot will in vain, whatsoever He may
will? Now the apostle had enjoined that prayers should be made for
all men, and had especially added, &#8220;For kings, and for all that
are in authority,&#8221; who might be supposed, in the pride and pomp
of worldly station, to shrink from the humility of the Christian
faith. Then saying, &#8220;For this is good and acceptable in the sight
of God our Saviour,&#8221; that is, that prayers should be made for
such as these, he immediately adds, as if to remove any ground of
despair, &#8220;Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the

Man, Ordered His Own Purposes Accordingly.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.cvi-p2">Wherefore, God would have been
willing to preserve even the first man in that state of salvation
in which he was created, and after he had begotten sons to remove
him at a fit time, without the intervention of death, to a better
place, where he should have been not only free from sin, but free
even from the desire of sinning, if He had foreseen that man would
have the steadfast will to persist in the state of innocence in
which he was created. But as He foresaw that man would make a bad
use of his free-will, that is, would sin, God arranged His own
designs rather with a view to do good to man even in his
sinfulness, that thus the good will of the Omnipotent might not be
made void by the evil will of man, but might be fulfilled in spite
of it.</p>

Created as to Be Able to Choose Either Good or Evil: in the Future
Life, the Choice of Evil Will Be Impossible.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.cvii-p2">Now it was expedient that man
should be at first so created, as to have it in his power both to
will what was right and to will what was wrong; not without reward
if he willed the former, and not without punishment if he willed
the latter. But in the future life it shall not be in his power to
will evil; and yet this will constitute no restriction on the
freedom of his will. On the contrary, his will shall be much freer
when it shall be wholly impossible for him to be the slave of sin.
We should never think of blaming the will, or saying that it was no
will, or that it was not to be called free, when we so desire
happiness, that not only do we shrink from misery, but find it
utterly impossible to do otherwise. As, then, the soul even now
finds it impossible to desire unhappiness, so in future it shall be
wholly impossible for it to desire sin. But God&#8217;s arrangement was
not to be broken, according to which He willed to show how good is
a rational being who is able even to refrain from sin, and yet how
much better is one who cannot sin at all; just as that was an
inferior sort of immortality, and yet it was immortality, when it
was possible for man to avoid death, although there is reserved for
the future a more perfect immortality, when it shall be impossible
for man to die.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.cviii-p2">The former immortality man lost
through the exercise of his free-will; the latter he shall obtain
through grace, whereas, if he had not sinned, he should have
obtained it by desert. Even in that case, however, there could have
been no merit without grace; because, although the mere exercise of
man&#8217;s free-will was sufficient to bring in sin, his free-will
would not have sufficed for his maintenance in righteousness,
unless God had assisted it by imparting a portion of His
unchangeable goodness. Just as it is in man&#8217;s power to die
whenever he will (for, not to speak of other means, any one can put
an end to himself by simple abstinence from food), but the mere
will cannot preserve life in the absence of food and the other
means of life; so man in paradise was able of his mere will, simply
by abandoning righteousness, to destroy himself; but to have
maintained a life of righteousness would have been too much for his
will, unless it had been sustained by the Creator&#8217;s power. After
the fall, however, a more abundant exercise of God&#8217;s mercy was
required, because the will itself had to be freed from the bondage
in which it was held by sin and death. And the will owes its
freedom in no degree to itself, but solely to the grace of God
which comes by faith in Jesus Christ; so that the very will,
through which we accept all the other gifts of God which lead us on
to His eternal gift, is itself prepared of the Lord, as the
Scripture says.<note place="end" n="1299" id="iv.ii.cviii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.cviii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Prov xvi. 1" id="iv.ii.cviii-p3.2" parsed="|Prov|16|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.16.1">Prov xvi. 1</scripRef>. [&#8220;The

Mediator, who alone of the human race was born, lived, and died
without sin, should reconcile us to God, and procure even for our
bodies a resurrection to eternal life, in order that the pride of
man might be exposed and cured through the humility of God; that
man might be shown how far he had departed from God, when God
became incarnate to bring him back; that an example might be set to
disobedient man in the life of obedience of the God-Man; that the
fountain of grace might be opened by the Only-begotten taking upon
Himself the form of a servant, a form which had no antecedent
merit; that an earnest of that resurrection of the body which is
promised to the redeemed might be given in the resurrection of the
Redeemer; that the devil might be subdued by the same nature which
it was his boast to have deceived, and yet man not glorified, lest
pride should again spring up; and, in fine, with a view to all the

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.cxii-p2">Nor can it be denied that the souls
of the dead are benefited by the piety of their living friends, who
offer the sacrifice of the Mediator, or give alms in the church on
their behalf. But these services are of advantage only to those who
during their lives have earned such merit, that services of this
kind can help them. For there is a manner of life which is neither
so good as not to require these services after death, nor so bad
that such services are of no avail after death; there is, on the
other hand, a kind of life so good as not to require them; and
again, one so bad that when life is over they render no help.
Therefore, it is in this life that all the merit or demerit is
acquired, which can either relieve or aggravate a man&#8217;s
sufferings after this life. No one, then, need hope that after he
is dead he shall obtain merit with God which he has neglected to
secure here. And accordingly it is plain that the services which
the church celebrates for the dead are in no way opposed to the
apostle&#8217;s words: &#8220;For we must all appear before the
judgment-seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done

alms are offered on behalf of all the baptized dead, they are
thank-offerings for the very good, they are propitiatory offerings
for the not very bad, and in the case of the very bad, even though
they do not assist the dead, they are a species of consolation to
the living. And where they are profitable, their benefit consists

too that we need the forgiveness that we ask, for it is here that
we commit the sins; here are the temptations which allure or drive

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.cxviii-p2">But the Evangelist Luke in his
version of the Lord&#8217;s prayer embraces not seven, but five
petitions: not, of course, that there is any discrepancy between
the two evangelists, but that Luke indicates by his very brevity
the mode in which the seven petitions of Matthew are to be
understood. For God&#8217;s name is hallowed in the spirit; and God&#8217;s
kingdom shall come in the resurrection of the body. Luke,
therefore, intending to show that the third petition is a sort of
repetition of the first two, has chosen to indicate that by
omitting the third altogether.<note place="end" n="1313" id="iv.ii.cxviii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.cxviii-p3"> [These petitions are retained in

daily bread, another for pardon of sin, another for immunity from
temptation. And what Matthew puts as the last petition, &#8220;but

the previous petition about temptation. Matthew, indeed, himself
says, &#8220;<i>but</i> deliver,&#8221; not &#8220;<i>and</i> deliver,&#8221; as if
to show that the petitions are virtually one: do not this, but
this; so that every man is to understand that he is delivered from
evil in the very fact of his not being led into
temptation.</p>

it dwells in a man, the better is the man in whom it dwells. For
when there is a question as to whether a man is good, one does not
ask what he believes, or what he hopes, but what he loves. For the
man who loves aright no doubt believes and hopes aright; whereas
the man who has not love believes in vain, even though his beliefs
are true; and hopes in vain, even though the objects of his hope
are a real part of true happiness; unless, indeed, he believes and
hopes for this, that he may obtain by prayer the blessing of love.
For, although it is not possible to hope without love, it may yet
happen that a man does not love that which is necessary to the
attainment of his hope; as, for example, if he hopes for eternal
life (and who is there that does not desire this?) and yet does not
love righteousness, without which no one can attain to eternal
life. Now this is the true faith of Christ which the
apos<pb n="275" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_275.html" id="iv.ii.cxix-Page_275"/>tle speaks of, &#8220;which worketh by love;&#8221;<note place="end" n="1316" id="iv.ii.cxix-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.cxix-p4"> <scripRef passage="Gal. v. 6" id="iv.ii.cxix-p4.2" parsed="|Gal|5|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.5.6">Gal. v. 6</scripRef></p></note> and if

History.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.ii.cxx-p2">When, sunk in the darkest depths of
ignorance, man lives according to the flesh undisturbed by any
struggle of reason or conscience, this is his first state.
Afterwards, when through the law has come the knowledge of sin, and
the Spirit of God has not yet interposed His aid, man, striving to
live according to the law, is thwarted in his efforts and falls
into conscious sin, and so, being overcome of sin, becomes its
slave (&#8220;for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought
in bondage&#8221;<note place="end" n="1319" id="iv.ii.cxx-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.cxx-p3"> <scripRef passage="2 Pet. ii. 19" id="iv.ii.cxx-p3.2" parsed="|2Pet|2|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Pet.2.19">2 Pet. ii. 19</scripRef></p></note>); and thus
the effect produced by the knowledge of the commandment is this,
that sin worketh in man all manner of concupiscence, and he is
involved in the additional guilt of willful transgression, and that
is fulfilled which is written: &#8220;The, law entered that the offense
might abound.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1320" id="iv.ii.cxx-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.cxx-p4"> <scripRef passage="Rom. v. 20" id="iv.ii.cxx-p4.2" parsed="|Rom|5|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.5.20">Rom. v. 20</scripRef></p></note> This is man&#8217;s second state. But
if God has regard to him, and inspires him with faith in God&#8217;s
help, and the Spirit of God begins to work in him, then the
mightier power of love strives against the power of the flesh; and
although there is still in the man&#8217;s own nature a power that
fights against him (for his disease is not completely cured), yet
he lives the life of the just by faith, and lives in righteousness
so far as he does not yield to evil lust, but conquers it by the
love of holiness. This is the third state of a man of good hope;
and he who by steadfast piety advances in this course, shall attain
at last to peace, that peace which, after this life is over, shall
be perfected in the repose of the spirit, and finally in the
resurrection of the body. Of these four different stages the first
is before the law, the second is under the law, the third is under
grace, and the fourth is in full and perfect peace. Thus, too, has
the history of God&#8217;s people been ordered according to His
pleasure who disposeth all things in number, and measure, and
weight.<note place="end" n="1321" id="iv.ii.cxx-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.ii.cxx-p5"> Comp.

church existed at first before the law; then under the law, which
was given by Moses; then under grace, which was first made manifest
in the coming of the Mediator. Not, indeed, that this grace was
absent previously, but, in harmony with the arrangements of the
time, it was veiled and hidden. For none, even of the just men of
old, could find salvation apart from the faith of Christ; nor
unless He had been known to them could their ministry have been
used to convey prophecies concerning Him to us, some more plain,
and some more obscure.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.i-p2"><span class="c9" id="iv.iii.i-p2.1">In</span> the
fourteenth chapter of the second book of his <i>Retractations</i>,
Augustin makes the following statement: &#8220;There is also a book of
ours on the subject of the <i>Catechising of the Uninstructed</i>,
[or, <i>for Instructing the Unlearned, De Catechizandis
Rudibus</i>], that being, indeed, the express title by which it is
designated. In this book, where I have said, <i>&#8216;Neither did the
angel, who, in company with other spirits who were his satellites,
forsook in pride the obedience of God, and became the devil, do any
hurt to God, but to himself; for God knoweth how to dispose of
souls that leave Him:&#8217;</i> it would be more appropriate to say,
<i>&#8216;spirits that leave Him,&#8217;</i> inasmuch as the question dealt
with angels. This book commences in these terms: <i>&#8216;You have
requested me, brother Deogratias.&#8217;</i> &#8221;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.i-p3">The composition so described in the
passage cited is reviewed by Augustin in connection with other
works which he had in hand about the year 400 <span class="c19" id="iv.iii.i-p3.1">
A.D.</span>, and may therefore be taken to belong to that date. It
has been conjectured that the person to whom it is addressed may
perhaps be the same with the presbyter Deogratias, to whom, as we
read in the epistle which now ranks as the hundred and second,
Augustin wrote about the year 406, in reply to some questions of
the pagans which were forwarded to him from Carthage.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.i-p4">The Benedictine editors introduce
the treatise in the following terms: &#8220;At the request of a deacon
of Carthage, Augustin undertakes the task of teaching the art of
catechising; and in the first place, he gives certain injunctions,
to the effect that this kind of duty may be discharged not only in
a settled method and an apt order, but also without tediousness,
and in a spirit of cheerfulness. Thereafter reducing his
injunctions to practical use, he gives an example of what he means
by delivering two set discourses, presenting parallels to each
other, the one being somewhat lengthened and the other very brief,
but both suitable for the instruction of any individual whose
desire is to be a Christian.&#8221;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.i-p5">[This treatise shows what was
thought in the age of Saint Augustin to be the most needful
instruction in religion. The Latin text: <i>De Cactechizandis
Rudibus</i>, is in the sixth vol. of the Benedictine edition, and

Asked by a Deacon of Carthage.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.ii-p2">1. You have requested me, brother
Deogratias, to send you in writing something which might be of
service to you in the matter of catechising the uninstructed. For
you have informed me that in Carthage, where you hold the position
of a deacon, persons, who have to be taught the Christian faith
from its very rudiments, are frequently brought to you by reason of
your enjoying the reputation of possessing a rich gift in
catechising, due at once to an intimate acquaintance with the
faith, and to an attractive method of discourse;<note place="end" n="1332" id="iv.iii.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.ii-p3"> Reading <i>et doctrina fidei et
suavitate sermonis</i>, instead of which, however, <i>et
doctrinam&#8230;suavitatem,</i> <i>etc.</i> also occurs, = possessing
at once a rich gift in catechising, and an intimate acquaintance
with the faith, and an attractive method of discourse, [or,
sweetness of language].</p></note> but that you almost always find
yourself in a difficulty as to the manner in which a suitable
declaration is to be made of the precise doctrine, the belief of
which constitutes us Christians: regarding the point at which our
statement of the same ought to commence, and the limit to which it
should be allowed to proceed: and with respect to the question
whether, when our narration is concluded, we ought to make use of
any kind of exhortation, or simply specify those precepts in the
observance of which the person to whom we are discoursing may know
the Christian life and profession to be maintained.<note place="end" n="1333" id="iv.iii.ii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.ii-p4"> Reading <i>retineri</i> as in the
<span class="c19" id="iv.iii.ii-p4.1">mss</span>. Some editions give <i>retinere</i> =
know how to maintain the Christian life and profession.</p></note> At the
same time, you have made the confession and complaint that it has
often befallen you that in the course of a lengthened and languid
address you have become profitless and distasteful even to
yourself, not to speak of the learner whom you have been
endeavoring to instruct by your utterance, and the other parties
who have been present as hearers; and that you have been
constrained by these straits to put upon me the constraint of that
love which I owe to you, so that I may not feel it a burdensome
thing among all my engagements to write you something on this
subject.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.ii-p5">2. As for myself then, if, in the
exercise of those capacities which through the bounty of our Lord I
am enabled to present, the same Lord requires me to offer any
manner of aid to those whom He has made brethren to me, I feel
constrained not only by that love and service which is due from me
to you on the terms of familiar friendship, but also by that which
I owe universally to my mother the Church, by no means to refuse
the task, but rather to take it up with a prompt and devoted
willingness. For the more extensively I desire to see the treasure
of the Lord<note place="end" n="1334" id="iv.iii.ii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.ii-p6"> <i>Pecuniam
Dominicam</i></p></note>
distributed, the more does it become my duty, if I ascertain that
the stewards, who are my fellow-servants, find any difficulty in
laying it out, to do all that lies in my power to the end that they
may be able to accomplish easily and expeditiously what they
sedulously and earnestly aim at.</p>

2.&#8212;How It Often Happens that a Discourse Which Gives Pleasure to
the Hearer is Distasteful to the Speaker; And What Explanation is
to Be Offered of that Fact.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.iii-p2">3. But as regards the idea thus
privately entertained by yourself in such efforts, I <pb n="284" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_284.html" id="iv.iii.iii-Page_284"/>would not
have you to be disturbed by the consideration that you have often
appeared to yourself to be delivering a poor and wearisome
discourse. For it may very well be the case that the matter has not
so presented itself to the person whom you were trying to instruct,
but that what you were uttering seemed to you to be unworthy of the
ears of others, simply because it was your own earnest desire that
there should be something better to listen to. Indeed with me, too,
it is almost always the fact that my speech displeases myself. For
I am covetous of something better, the possession of which I
frequently enjoy within me before I commence to body it forth in
intelligible words:<note place="end" n="1335" id="iv.iii.iii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.iii-p3"> <i>Verbis
sonantibus</i>,&#8212;sounding
words.</p></note> and then when my capacities of
expression prove inferior to my inner apprehensions, I grieve over
the inability which my tongue has betrayed in answering to my
heart. For it is my wish that he who hears me should have the same
complete understanding of the subject which I have myself; and I
perceive that I fail to speak in a manner calculated to effect
that, and that this arises mainly from the circumstance that the
intellectual apprehension diffuses itself through the mind with
something like a rapid flash, whereas the utterance is slow, and
occupies time, and is of a vastly different nature, so that, while
this latter is moving on, the intellectual apprehension has already
withdrawn itself within its secret abodes. Yet, in consequence of
its having stamped certain impressions of itself in a marvellous
manner upon the memory, these prints endure with the brief pauses
of the syllables;<note place="end" n="1336" id="iv.iii.iii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.iii-p4"> <i>Perdurant illa cum syllabarum
morulis</i></p></note> and as the outcome of these same
impressions we form intelligible signs,<note place="end" n="1337" id="iv.iii.iii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.iii-p5"> <i>Sonantia
signa,</i>&#8212;vocal signs.</p></note> which get the name of a certain
language, either the Latin, or the Greek, or the Hebrew, or some
other. And these signs may be objects of thought, or they may also
be actually uttered by the voice. On the other hand however, the
impressions themselves are neither Latin, nor Greek, nor Hebrew,
nor peculiar to any other race whatsoever, but are made good in the
mind just as looks are in the body. For anger is designated by one
word in Latin, by another in Greek, and by different terms in other
languages, according to their several diversities. But the look of
the angry man is neither (peculiarly) Latin nor (peculiarly) Greek.
Thus it is that when a person says <i>Iratus sum</i>,<note place="end" n="1338" id="iv.iii.iii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.iii-p6"> I am angry.</p></note> he is not
understood by every nation, but only by the Latins; whereas, if the
mood of his mind when it is kindling to wrath comes forth upon the
face and affects the look, all who have the individual within their
view understand that he is angry. But, again, it is not in our
power to bring out those impressions which the intellectual
apprehension stamps upon the memory, and to hold them forth, as it
were, to the perception of the hearers by means of the sound of the
voice, in any manner parallel to the clear and evident form in
which the look appears. For those former are within in the mind,
while this latter is without in the body. Wherefore we have to
surmise how far the sound of our mouth must be from representing
that stroke of the intelligence, seeing that it does not correspond
even with the impression produced upon the memory. Now, it is a
common occurrence with us that, in the ardent desire to effect what
is of profit to our hearer, our aim is to express ourselves to him
exactly as our intellectual apprehension is at the time, when, in
the very effort, we are failing in the ability to speak; and then,
because this does not succeed with us, we are vexed, and we pine in
weariness as if we were applying ourselves to vain labors; and, as
the result of this very weariness, our discourse becomes itself
more languid and pointless even than it was when it first induced
such a sense of tediousness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.iii-p7">4. But ofttimes the earnestness of
those who are desirous of hearing me shows me that my utterance is
not so frigid as it seems to myself to be. From the delight, too,
which they exhibit, I gather that they derive some profit from it.
And I occupy myself sedulously with the endeavor not to fail in
putting before them a service in which I perceive them to take in
such good part what is put before them. Even, so, on your side
also, the very fact that persons who require to be instructed in
the faith are brought so frequently to you, ought to help you to
understand that your discourse is not displeasing to others as it
is displeasing to yourself; and you ought not to consider yourself
unfruitful, simply because you do not succeed in setting forth in
such a manner as you desire the things which you discern; for,
perchance, you may be just as little able to discern them in the
way you wish. For in this life who sees except as &#8220;in an enigma
and through a glass&#8221;?<note place="end" n="1339" id="iv.iii.iii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.iii-p8"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiii. 12" id="iv.iii.iii-p8.2" parsed="|1Cor|13|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.12">1 Cor. xiii. 12</scripRef></p></note> Neither is love itself of might
sufficient to rend the darkness of the flesh, and penetrate into
that eternal calm from which even things which pass away derive the
light in which they shine. But inasmuch as day by day the good are
making advances towards the vision of that day, in<pb n="285" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_285.html" id="iv.iii.iii-Page_285"/>dependent of

night, &#8220;which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it
entered into the heart of man,&#8221;<note place="end" n="1341" id="iv.iii.iii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.iii-p10"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 9" id="iv.iii.iii-p10.2" parsed="|1Cor|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.9">1 Cor. ii. 9</scripRef></p></note> there is no greater reason why our
discourse should become valueless in our own estimate, when we are
engaged in teaching the uninstructed, than this,&#8212;namely, that it
is a delight to us to discern in an extraordinary fashion, and a
weariness to speak in an ordinary. And in reality we are listened
to with much greater satisfaction, indeed, when we ourselves also
have pleasure in the same work; for the thread of our address is
affected by the very joy of which we ourselves are sensible, and it
proceeds from us with greater ease and with more acceptance.
Consequently, as regards those matters which are recommended as
articles of belief, the task is not a difficult one to lay down
injunctions, with respect to the points at which the narration
should be commenced and ended, or with respect to the method in
which the narration is to be varied, so that at one time it may be
briefer, at another more lengthened, and yet at all times full and
perfect; and, again, with respect to the particular occasions on
which it may be right to use the shorter form, and those on which
it will be proper to employ the longer. But as to the means by
which all is to be done, so that every one may have pleasure in his
work when he catechises (for the better he succeeds in this the
more attractive will he be),&#8212;that is what requires the greatest
consideration. And yet we have not far to seek for the precept
which will rule in this sphere. For if, in the matter of carnal
means, God loves a cheerful giver,<note place="end" n="1342" id="iv.iii.iii-p10.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.iii-p11"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. ix. 7" id="iv.iii.iii-p11.2" parsed="|2Cor|9|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.7">2 Cor. ix. 7</scripRef></p></note> how much more so in that of the
spiritual? But our security that this cheerfulness may be with us
at the seasonable hour, is something dependent upon the mercy of
Him who has given us such precepts. Therefore, in accordance with
my understanding of what your own wish is, we shall discuss in the
first place the subject of the method of narration, then that of
the duty of delivering injunction and exhortation, and afterwards
that of the attainment of the said cheerfulness, so far as God may
furnish us with the ideas.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.iv-p2">5. The narration is full when each
person is catechised in the first instance from what is written in
the text, &#8220;In the beginning God created the heaven and the

present times of the Church. This does not imply, however, either
that we ought to repeat by memory the entire Pentateuch, and the
entire Books of Judges, and Kings, and Esdras,<note place="end" n="1344" id="iv.iii.iv-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.iv-p4"> In the <span class="c19" id="iv.iii.iv-p4.1">

the Apostles, if we have learned all these word for word; or that
we should put all the matters which are contained in these volumes
into our own words, and in that manner unfold and expound them as a
whole. For neither does the time admit of that, nor does any
necessity demand it. But what we ought to do is, to give a
comprehensive statement of all things, summarily and generally, so
that certain of the more wonderful facts may be selected which are
listened to with superior gratification, and which have been ranked
so remarkably among the exact turning-points (of the history);<note place="end" n="1345" id="iv.iii.iv-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.iv-p5"> <i>In ipsis articulis</i>

instead of exhibiting them to view only in their wrappings, if we
may so speak, and then instantly snatching them from our sight, we
ought to dwell on them for a certain space, and thus, as it were,
unfold them and open them out to vision, and present them to the
minds of the hearers as things to be examined and admired. But as
for all other details, these should be passed over rapidly, and
thus far introduced and woven into the narrative. The effect of
pursuing this plan is, that the particular facts which we wish to
see specially commended to attention obtain greater prominence in
consequence of the others being made to yield to them; while, at
the same time, neither does the learner, whose interest we are
anxious to stimulate by our statement, come to these subjects with
a mind already exhausted, nor is confusion induced upon the memory
of the person whom we ought to be instructing by our
teaching.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.iv-p6">6. In all things, indeed, not only
ought our own eye to be kept fixed upon the end of the commandment,

same, and guided in that direction. And, in truth, for no other
reason were all those things which we read in the Holy Scriptures
written, previous to the Lord&#8217;s advent, but for this,&#8212;namely,
that His advent might be pressed upon the attention, and that
the <pb n="286" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_286.html" id="iv.iii.iv-Page_286"/>Church which was to be, should be intimated beforehand,
that is to say, the people of God throughout all nations; which
Church is His body, wherewith also are united and numbered all the
saints who lived in this world, even before His advent, and who
believed then in His future coming, just as we believe in His past
coming. For (to use an illustration) Jacob, at the time when he was
being born, first put forth from the womb a hand, with which also
he held the foot of the brother who was taking priority of him in
the act of birth; and next indeed the head followed, and
thereafter, at last, and as matter of course, the rest of the
members:<note place="end" n="1348" id="iv.iii.iv-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.iv-p9"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xxv. 26" id="iv.iii.iv-p9.2" parsed="|Gen|25|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.25.26">Gen. xxv. 26</scripRef></p></note> while,
nevertheless the head in point of dignity and power has precedence,
not only of those members which followed it then, but also of the
very hand which anticipated it in the process of the birth, and is
really the first, although not in the matter of the time of
appearing, at least in the order of nature. And in an analogous
manner, the Lord Jesus Christ, previous to His appearing in the
flesh, and coming forth in a certain manner out of the womb of His
secrecy, before the eyes of men as Man, the Mediator between God
and men,<note place="end" n="1349" id="iv.iii.iv-p9.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.iv-p10"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. ii. 5" id="iv.iii.iv-p10.2" parsed="|1Tim|2|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.2.5">1 Tim. ii. 5</scripRef></p></note> &#8220;who is

in their pride, using for that purpose the bonds of the law, as if

no cessation in the foretelling and prophesying of His own destined
coming; and in a manner consonant with this, he through whom the
law was given wrote five books; and proud men, who were carnally
minded, and sought to &#8220;establish their own righteousness,&#8221;<note place="end" n="1353" id="iv.iii.iv-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.iv-p14"> <scripRef passage="Rom. x. 3" id="iv.iii.iv-p14.2" parsed="|Rom|10|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.10.3">Rom. x. 3</scripRef></p></note> were not
filled with blessing by the open hand of Christ, but were debarred

these have been attached to that same body of which He is the head,
in virtue of their believing in Him whom they announced
prophetically. For they were not sundered (from that body) in
consequence of fulfilling their course before Him, but rather were
they made one with the same by reason of their obedience. For
although the hand may be put forward away before the head, still it
has its connection beneath the head. Wherefore all things which
were written aforetime were written in order that we might be

is no mightier invitation to love than to anticipate in loving; and
that soul is over hard which, supposing it unwilling indeed to give
love, is unwilling also to give the return of love. But if, even in
the case of criminal and sordid loves, we see how those who desire
to be loved in return make it their special and absorbing business,
by such proofs as are within their power, to render the strength of
the love which they themselves bear plain and patent; if we also
perceive how they affect to put forward an appearance of justice in
what they thus offer, such as may qualify them in some sort to
demand that a response be made in all fairness to them on the part
of those souls which they are laboring to beguile; if, further,
their own passion burns more vehemently when they observe that the
minds which they are eager to possess are also moved now by the
same fire: if thus, I say, it happens at once that the soul which
before was torpid is excited so soon as it feels itself to be
loved, and that <pb n="287" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_287.html" id="iv.iii.v-Page_287"/>the soul which was enkindled
already becomes the more inflamed so soon as it is made cognizant
of the return of its own love, it is evident that no greater reason
is to be found why love should be either originated or enlarged,
than what appears in the occasion when one who as yet loves not at
all comes to know himself to be the object of love, or when one who
is already a lover either hopes that he may yet be loved in turn,
or has by this time the evidence of a response to his affection.
And if this holds good even in the case of base loves, how much
more<note place="end" n="1364" id="iv.iii.v-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.v-p9"> Reading <i>quanto plus</i>, for
which some <span class="c19" id="iv.iii.v-p9.1">mss</span>. give <i>plurius</i>, while
in a large number we find <i>purius</i> = with how much greater
purity should it hold good, etc.</p></note> in (true)
friendship? For what else have we carefully to attend to in this
question touching the injuring of friendship than to this, namely,
not to give our friend cause to suppose either that we do not love
him at all, or that we love him less than he loves us? If, indeed,
he is led to entertain this belief, he will be cooler in that love
in which men enjoy the interchange of intimacies one with another;
and if he is not of that weak type of character to which such an
offense to affection will serve as a cause of freezing off from
love altogether, he yet confines himself to that kind of affection
in which he loves, not with the view of enjoyment to himself, but
with the idea of studying the good of others. But again it is worth
our while to notice how,&#8212;although superiors also have the wish to
be loved by their inferiors, and are gratified with the zealous
attention<note place="end" n="1365" id="iv.iii.v-p9.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.v-p10"> Reading <i>

them by such, and themselves cherish greater affection towards
these inferiors the more they become cognizant of that,&#8212;with what
might of love, nevertheless, the inferior kindles so soon as he
learns that he is beloved by his superior. For there have we love
in its more grateful aspect, where it does not consume itself<note place="end" n="1366" id="iv.iii.v-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.v-p11"> <i>&#198;stuat</i>= burn, heave.</p></note> in the
drought of want, but flows forth in the plenteousness of
beneficence. For the former type of love is of misery, the latter
of mercy.<note place="end" n="1367" id="iv.iii.v-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.v-p12"> <i>Ex miseria&#8230;ex
misericordia</i></p></note> And
furthermore, if the inferior was despairing even of the possibility
of his being loved by his superior, he will now be inexpressibly
moved to love if the superior has of his own will condescended to
show how much he loves this person who could by no means be bold
enough to promise himself so great a good. But what is there
superior to God in the character of Judge? and what more desperate
than man in the character of sinner?&#8212;than man, I ask, who had
given himself all the more unreservedly up to the wardship and
domination of proud powers which are unable to make him blessed, as
he had come more absolutely to despair of the possibility of his
being an object of interest to that power which wills not to be
exalted in wickedness, but is exalted in goodness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.v-p13">8. If, therefore, it was mainly for
this purpose that Christ came, to wit, that man might learn how
much God loves him; and that he might learn this, to the intent
that he might be kindled to the love of Him by whom he was first
loved, and might also love his neighbor at the command and showing
of Him who became our neighbor, in that He loved man when, instead
of being a neighbor to Him, he was sojourning far apart: if, again,
all divine Scripture, which was written aforetime, was written with
the view of presignifying the Lord&#8217;s advent; and if whatever has
been committed to writing in times subsequent to these, and
established by divine authority, is a record of Christ, and
admonishes us of love, it is manifest that on those two
commandments of love to God and love to our neighbor<note place="end" n="1368" id="iv.iii.v-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.v-p14"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 22.40" id="iv.iii.v-p14.1" parsed="|Matt|22|40|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.40">Matt. xxii. 40</scripRef></p></note> hang not
only all the law and the prophets, which at the time when the Lord
spoke to that effect were as yet the only Holy Scripture, but also
all those books of the divine literature which have been written<note place="end" n="1369" id="iv.iii.v-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.v-p15"> Reading <i>conscripta</i>, for

period for our health, and consigned to remembrance. Wherefore, in
the Old Testament there is a veiling of the New, and in the New
Testament there is a revealing of the Old. According to that
veiling, carnal men, understanding things in a carnal fashion, have
been under the dominion, both then and now, of a penal fear.
According to this revealing, on the other hand, spiritual
men,&#8212;among whom we reckon at once those then who knocked in piety
and found even hidden things opened to them, and others now who
seek in no spirit of pride, lest even things uncovered should be
closed to them,&#8212;understanding in a spiritual fashion, have been
made free through the love wherewith they have been gifted.
Consequently, inasmuch as there is nothing more adverse to love
than envy, and as pride is the mother of envy, the same Lord Jesus
Christ, God-man, is both a manifestation of divine love towards us,
and an example of human humility with us, to the end that our great
swelling might be cured by a greater counteracting remedy. For here
is great misery, proud man! But there is greater mercy, a humble
God! Take this love, therefore, as the end that is set
before <pb n="288" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_288.html" id="iv.iii.v-Page_288"/>you, to which you are to refer all that you say, and,
whatever you narrate, narrate it in such a manner that he to whom
you are discoursing on hearing may believe, on believing may hope,
on hoping may love.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.vi-p2">9. Moreover, it is on the gound of
that very severity of God,<note place="end" n="1370" id="iv.iii.vi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.vi-p3"> <i>De ipsa etiam severitate
Dei&#8230;caritas &#230;dificanda est</i></p></note> by which the hearts of mortals are
agitated with a most wholesome terror, that love is to be built up;
so that, rejoicing that he is loved by Him whom he fears, man may
have boldness to love Him in return, and yet at the same time be
afraid to displease His love toward himself, even should he be able
to do so with impunity. For certainly it very rarely happens, nay,
I should rather say, never, that any one approaches us with the
wish to become a Christian who has not been smitten with some sort
of fear of God. For if it is in the expectation of some advantage
from men whom he deems himself unlikely to please in any other way,
or with the idea of escaping any disadvantage at the hands of men
of whose displeasure or hostility he is seriously afraid, that a
man wishes to become a Christian, then his wish to become one is
not so earnest as his desire to feign one.<note place="end" n="1371" id="iv.iii.vi-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.vi-p4"> <i>Non fieri vult potius quam

<i>salvandi</i>, while certain <span class="c19" id="iv.iii.vi-p5.2">mss</span>. have
<i>salutis</i>, and others <i>saltantis</i>.</p></note> but of the mind which believes.
But unmistakeably it is often the case that the mercy of God comes
to be present through the ministry of the catechiser, so that,
affected by the discourse, the man now wishes to become in reality
that which he had made up his mind only to feign. And so soon as he
begins to have this manner of desire, we may judge him then to have
made a genuine approach to us. It is true, indeed, that the precise
time when a man, whom we perceive to be present with us already in
the body, comes to us in reality with his mind,<note place="end" n="1373" id="iv.iii.vi-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.vi-p6"> Reading <i>quando veniat
animo</i>, for which <i>quo veniat animo</i> also occurs = the mind
in which a man comes&#8230;is a matter hidden from us.</p></note> is a thing hidden from us. But,
notwithstanding that, we ought to deal with him in such a manner
that this wish may be made to arise within him, even should it not
be there at present. For no such labor is lost, inasmuch as, if
there is any wish at all, it is assuredly strengthened by such
action on our part, although we may be ignorant of the time or the
hour at which it began. It is useful certainly, if it can be done,
to get from those who know the man some idea beforehand of the
state of mind in which he is, or of the causes which have induced
him to come with the view of embracing religion. But if there is no
other person available from whom we may gather such information,
then, indeed, the man himself is to be interrogated, so that from
what he says in reply we may draw the beginning of our discourse.
Now if he has come with a false heart, desirous only of human
advantages or thinking to escape disadvantages, he will certainly
speak what is untrue. Nevertheless, the very untruth which he
utters should be made the point from which we start. This should
not be done, however, with the (open) intention of confuting his
falsehood, as if that were a settled matter with you; but, taking
it for granted that he has professed to have come with a purpose
which is really worthy of approbation (whether that profession be
true or false), it should rather be our aim to commend and praise
such a purpose as that with which, in his reply, he has declared
himself to have come; so that we may make him feel it a pleasure to
be the kind of man actually that he wishes to seem to be. On the
other hand, supposing him to have given a declaration of his views
other than what ought to be before the mind of one who is to be
instructed in the Christian faith, then by reproving him with more
than usual kindness and gentleness, as a person uninstructed and
ignorant, by pointing out and commending, concisely and in a grave
spirit the end of Christian doctrine in its genuine reality, and by
doing all this in such a manner as neither to anticipate the times
of a narration, which should be given subsequently, nor to venture
to impose that kind of statement upon a mind not previously set for
it, you may bring him to desire that which, either in mistake or in
dissimulation, he has not been desiring up to this
stage.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.vii-p2">10. But if it happens that his
answer is to the effect that he has met with some divine warning,
or with some divine terror, prompting him to become a Christian,
this opens up the way most satisfactorily for a commencement to our
discourse, by suggesting the greatness of God&#8217;s interest in us.
His thoughts, <pb n="289" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_289.html" id="iv.iii.vii-Page_289"/>however, ought certainly to be
turned away from this line of things, whether miracles or dreams,
and directed to the more solid path and the surer oracles of the
Scriptures; so that he may also come to understand how mercifully
that warning was administered to him in advance,<note place="end" n="1374" id="iv.iii.vii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.vii-p3"> <i>Pr&#230;rogata sit</i></p></note> previous to his giving himself to
the Holy Scriptures. And assuredly it ought to be pointed out to
him, that the Lord Himself would neither thus have admonished him
and urged him on to become a Christian, and to be incorporated into
the Church, nor have taught him by such signs or revelations, had
it not been His will that, for his greater safety and security, he
should enter upon a pathway already prepared in the Holy
Scriptures, in which he should not seek after visible miracles, but
learn the habit of hoping for things invisible, and in which also
he should receive monitions not in sleep but in wakefulness. At
this point the narration ought now to be commenced, which should
start with the fact that God made all things very good,<note place="end" n="1375" id="iv.iii.vii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.vii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Gen. i. 31" id="iv.iii.vii-p4.2" parsed="|Gen|1|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.31">Gen. i. 31</scripRef></p></note> and which
should be continued, as we have said, on to the present times of
the Church. This should be done in such a manner as to give, for
each of the affairs and events which we relate, causes and reasons
by which we may refer them severally to that end of love from which
neither the eye of the man who is occupied in doing anything, nor
that of the man who is engaged in speaking, ought to be turned
away. For if, even in handling the fables of the poets, which are
but fictitious creations and things devised for the pleasure<note place="end" n="1376" id="iv.iii.vii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.vii-p5"> Reading <i>ad voluptatem</i>. But

whose food is found in trifles, those grammarians who have the
reputation and the name of being good do nevertheless endeavor to
bring them to bear upon some kind of (assumed) use, although that
use itself may be only something vain and grossly bent upon the

become us to be, not to let those genuine verities which we
narrate, in consequence of any want of a well-considered account of
their causes, be accepted either with a gratification which issues
in no practical good, or, still less, with a cupidity which may
prove hurtful! At the same time, we are not to set forth these
causes in such a manner as to leave the proper course of our
narration, and let our heart and our tongue indulge in digressions
into the knotty questions of more intricate discussion. But the
simple truth of the explanation which we adduce<note place="end" n="1378" id="iv.iii.vii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.vii-p7"> Reading <i>veritas adhibit&#339;

<span class="c2" id="iv.iii.viii-p1.1">Chapter 7.&#8212;Of the Exposition
of the Resurrection, the Judgment, and Other Subjects, Which Should
Follow This Narration.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.viii-p2">11. On the completion of this
narration, the hope of the resurrection should be set forth, and,
so far as the capacity and strength of the hearer will bear it, and
so far also as the measure of time at our disposal will allow, we
ought to handle our arguments against the vain scoffings of
unbelievers on the subject of the resurrection of the body, as well
as on that of the future judgment, with its goodness in relation to
the good, its severity in relation to the evil, its truth in
relation to all. And after the penalties of the impious have thus
been declared with detestation and horror, then the kingdom of the
righteous and faithful, and that supernal city and its joy, should
form the next themes for our discourse. At this point, moreover, we
ought to equip and animate the weakness of man in withstanding
temptations and offenses, whether these emerge without or rise
within the church itself; without, as in opposition to Gentiles, or
Jews, or heretics; within, on the other hand, as in opposition to
the chaff of the Lord&#8217;s threshing-floor. It is not meant,
however, that we are to dispute against each several type of
perverse men, and that all their wrong opinions are to be refuted
by set arrays of argumentations: but, in a manner suitable to a
limited allowance of time, we ought to show how all this was
foretold, and to point out of what service temptations are in the
training of the faithful, and what relief<note place="end" n="1380" id="iv.iii.viii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.viii-p3"> <i>Medicina</i></p></note> there is in the example of the
patience of God, who has resolved to permit them even to the end.
But, again, while he is being furnished against these
(adversaries), whose perverse multitudes fill the churches so far
as bodily presence is concerned, the precepts of a Christian and
honorable manner of life should also be briefly and befittingly
detailed at the same time, to the intent that he may neither allow
himself to be easily led astray in this way, by any who are
drunkards, covetous, fraudulent, gamesters, adulterers,
fornicators, lovers of public spectacles, wearers of unholy charms,
sorcerers, astrologers, or diviners practising <pb n="290" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_290.html" id="iv.iii.viii-Page_290"/>any sort of
vain and wicked arts, and all other parties of a similar character;
nor to let himself fancy that any such course may be followed with
impunity on his part, simply because he sees many who are called
Christians loving these things, and engaging themselves with them,
and defending them, and recommending them, and actually persuading
others to their use. For as to the end which is appointed for those
who persist in such a mode of life, and as to the method in which
they are to be borne with in the church itself, out of which they
are destined to be separated in the end,&#8212;these are subjects in
which the learner ought to be instructed by means of the
testimonies of the divine books. He should also, however, be
informed beforehand that he will find in the church many good
Christians, most genuine citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem, if he
sets about being such himself. And, finally, he must be sedulously
warned against letting his hope rest on man. For it is not a matter
that can be easily judged by man, what man is righteous. And even
were this a matter which could be easily done, still the object
with which the examples of righteous men are set before us is not
that we may be justified by them, but that, as we imitate them, we
may understand how we ourselves also are justified by their
Justifier. For the issue of this will be something which must merit
the highest approval,&#8212;namely this, that when the person who is
hearing us, or rather, who is hearing God by us, has begun to make
some progress in moral qualities and in knowledge, and to enter
upon the way of Christ with ardor, he will not be so bold as to
ascribe the change either to us or to himself; but he will love
both himself and us, and whatever other persons he loves as
friends, in Him, and for His sake who loved him when he was an
enemy, in order that He might justify him and make him a friend.
And now that we have advanced thus far, I do not think that you
need any preceptor to tell you how you should discuss matters
briefly, when either your own time or that of those who are hearing
you is occupied; and how, on the other hand, you should discourse
at greater length when there is more time at your command. For the
very necessity of the case recommends this, apart from the counsel
of any adviser.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.ix-p2">12. But there is another case which
evidently must not be overlooked. I mean the case of one coming to
you to receive catchetical instruction who has cultivated the field
of liberal studies, who has already made up his mind to be a
Christian, and who has betaken himself to you for the express
purpose of becoming one. It can scarcely fail to be the fact that a
person of this character has already acquired a considerable
knowledge of our Scriptures and literature; and, furnished with
this, he may have come now simply with the view of being made a
partaker in the sacraments. For it is customary with men of this
class to inquire carefully into all things, not at the very time
when they are made Christians, but previous to that, and thus early
also to communicate and reason, with any whom they can reach, on
the subject of the feelings of their own minds. Consequently a
brief method of procedure should be adopted with these, so as not
to inculcate on them, in an odious fashion<note place="end" n="1381" id="iv.iii.ix-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.ix-p3"> Reading <i>odiose</i>, for which
several <span class="c19" id="iv.iii.ix-p3.1">mss</span>. give <i>otiose</i> =

but to pass over these with a light and modest touch. Thus we
should say how we believe that they are already familiar with this
and the other subject, and that we therefore simply reckon up in a
cursory manner all those facts which require to be formally urged
upon the attention of the uninstructed and unlearned. And we should
endeavor so to proceed, that, supposing this man of culture to have
been previously acquainted with any one of our themes, he may not
hear it now as from a teacher; and that, in the event of his being
still ignorant of any of them, he may yet learn the same while we
are going over the things with which we understand him to be
already familiar. Moreover, it is certainly not without advantage
to interrogate the man himself as to the means by which he was
induced to desire to be a Christian; so that, if you discover him
to have been moved to that decision by books, whether they be the
canonical writings or the compositions of literary men worth the
studying,<note place="end" n="1382" id="iv.iii.ix-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.ix-p4"> <i>Utilium
tractatorum</i></p></note> you may
say something about these at the outset, expressing your
approbation of them in a manner which may suit the distinct merits
which they severally possess, in respect of canonical authority and
of skillfully applied diligence on the part of these expounders;<note place="end" n="1383" id="iv.iii.ix-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.ix-p5"> Reading <i>exponentium</i>.
Various codices give <i>ad exponendum</i> = in

the case of the canonical Scriptures, commending above all the most
salutary modesty (of language) displayed alongside their wonderful
loftiness (of subject); while, in those other productions you
notice, in accordance with the <pb n="291" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_291.html" id="iv.iii.ix-Page_291"/>characteristic faculty of each
several writer, a style of a more sonorous and, as it were more
rounded eloquence adapted to minds that are prouder, and, by reason
thereof weaker. We should certainly also elicit from him some
account of himself, so that he may give us to understand what
writer he chiefly perused, and with what books he was more
familiarly conversant, as these were the means of moving him to
wish to be associated with the church. And when he has given us
this information, then if the said books are known to us, or if we
have at least ecclesiastical report as our warrant for taking them
to have been written by some catholic man of note, we should

admitted that even those who have departed this life as genuine
catholics, and have left to posterity some Christian writings, in
certain passages of their small works, either in consequence of
their failing to be understood, or (as the way is with human
infirmity) because they lack ability to pierce into the deeper
mysteries with the eye of the mind, and in (pursuing) the semblance
of what is true, wander from the truth itself, have proved an
occasion to the presumptuous and audacious for constructing and
generating some heresy. This, however, is not to be wondered at,
when, even in the instance of the canonical writings themselves,
where all things have been expressed in the soundest manner, we see
how it has happened,&#8212;not indeed through merely taking certain
passages in a sense different from that which the writer had in
view or which is consistent with the truth itself, (for if this
were all, who would not gladly pardon human infirmity, when it
exhibits a readiness to accept correction?), but by persistently
defending, with the bitterest vehemence and in impudent arrogance,
opinions which they have taken up in perversity and error,&#8212;many
have given birth to many pernicious dogmas at the cost of rending
the unity of the (Christian) communion. All these subjects we
should discuss in modest conference with the individual who makes
his approach to the society of the Christian people, not in the
character of an uneducated man,<note place="end" n="1386" id="iv.iii.ix-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.ix-p8"> <i>Idiota</i></p></note> as they say, but in that of one
who has passed through a finished culture and training in the books
of the learned. And in enjoining him to guard against the errors of
presumption, we should assume only so much authority as that
humility of his, which induced him to come to us, is now felt to
admit of. As to other things, moreover, in accordance with the
rules of saving doctrine, which require to be narrated or
discussed, whether they be matters relating to the faith, or
questions bearing on the moral life, or others dealing with
temptations, all these should be gone through in the manner which I
have indicated, and ought therein to be referred to the more
excellent way (already noticed).<note place="end" n="1387" id="iv.iii.ix-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.ix-p9"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xii. 31" id="iv.iii.ix-p9.2" parsed="|1Cor|12|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.31">1 Cor. xii. 31</scripRef>. See also

<span class="c2" id="iv.iii.x-p1.1">Chapter 9.&#8212;Of
the Method in Which Grammarians and Professional Speakers are to Be
Dealt with.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.x-p2">13. There are also some who come
from the commonest schools of the grammarians and professional
speakers, whom you may not venture to reckon either among the
uneducated or among those very learned classes whose minds have
been exercised in questions of real magnitude. When such persons,
therefore, who appear to be superior to the rest of mankind, so far
as the art of speaking is concerned, approach you with the view of
becoming Christians, it will be your duty in your communications
with them, in a higher degree than in your dealings with those
other illiterate hearers, to make it plain that they are to be
diligently admonished to clothe themselves with Christian humility,
and learn not to despise individuals whom they may discover keeping
themselves free from vices of conduct more carefully than from
faults of language; and also that they ought not to presume so much
as to compare with a pure heart the practised tongue which they
were accustomed even to put in preference. But above all, such
persons should be taught to listen to the divine Scriptures, so
that they may neither deem solid eloquence to be mean, merely
because it is not inflated, nor suppose that the words or
deeds <pb n="292" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_292.html" id="iv.iii.x-Page_292"/>of men, of which we read the accounts in those books,
involved and covered as they are in carnal wrappings,<note place="end" n="1388" id="iv.iii.x-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.x-p3"> <i>Carnalibus integumentis
involuta atque operta</i></p></note> are not to
be drawn forth and unfolded with a view to an (adequate)
understanding of them, but are to be taken merely according to the
sound of the letter. And as to this same matter of the utility of
the hidden meaning, the existence of which is the reason why they
are called also mysteries, the power wielded by these intricacies
of enigmatical utterances in the way of sharpening our love for the
truth, and shaking off the torpor of weariness, is a thing which
the persons in question must have made good to them by actual
experience, when some subject which failed to move them when it was
placed baldly before them, has its significance elicited by the
detailed working out of an allegorical sense. For it is in the
highest degree useful to such men to come to know how ideas are to
be preferred to words, just as the soul is preferred to the body.
And from this, too, it follows that they ought to have the desire
to listen to discourses remarkable for their truth, rather than to
those which are notable for their eloquence; just as they ought to
be anxious to have friends distinguished for their wisdom, rather
than those whose chief merit is their beauty. They should also
understand that there is no voice for the ears of God save the
affection of the soul. For thus they will not act the mocker if
they happen to observe any of the prelates and ministers of the
Church either calling upon God in language marked by barbarisms and
solecisms, or failing in understanding correctly the very words
which they are pronouncing, and making confused pauses.<note place="end" n="1389" id="iv.iii.x-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.x-p4"> Or = confusing the sense by false
pauses: <i>perturbateque distinguere</i>.</p></note> It is not
meant, of course, that such faults are not to be corrected, so that
the people may say &#8220;Amen&#8221; to something which they plainly
understand; but what is intended is, that such things should be
piously borne with by those who have come to understand how, as in
the forum it is in the sound, so in the church it is in the desire
that the grace of speech resides.<note place="end" n="1390" id="iv.iii.x-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.x-p5"> <i>Ut sono in foro, sic voto in

sometimes be called good speech, but never gracious speech.<note place="end" n="1391" id="iv.iii.x-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.x-p6"> <i>Bona dictio, nunquam tamen
benedictio</i></p></note> Moreover,
with respect to the sacrament which they are about to receive, it
is enough for the more intelligent simply to hear what the thing
signifies. But with those of slower intellect, it will be necessary
to adopt a somewhat more detailed explanation, together with the
use of similitudes, to prevent them from despising what they
see.</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.iii.xi-p1.1">Chapter 10.&#8212;Of the
Attainment of Cheerfulness in the Duty of Catechising, and of
Various Causes Producing Weariness in the Catechumen.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xi-p2">14. At this point you perhaps
desiderate some example of the kind of discourse intended, so that
I may show you by an actual instance how the things which I have
recommended are to be done. This indeed I shall do, so far as by
God&#8217;s help I shall be able. But before proceeding to that, it is
my duty, in consistency with what I have promised, to speak of the
acquisition of the cheerfulness (to which I have alluded). For as
regards the matter of the rules in accordance with which your
discourse should be set forth, in the case of the catechetical
instruction of a person who comes with the express view of being
made a Christian, I have already made good, as far as has appeared
sufficient, the promise which I made. And surely I am under no
obligation at the same time to do myself in this volume that which
I enjoin as the right thing to be done. Consequently, if I do that,
it will have the value of an overplus. But how can the overplus be
super-added by me before I have filled up the measure of what is
due? Besides, one thing which I have heard you make the subject of
your complaint above all others, is the fact that your discourse
seemed to yourself to be poor and spiritless when you were
instructing any one in the Christian name. Now this, I know,
results not so much from want of matter to say, with which I am
well aware you are sufficiently provided and furnished, or from
poverty of speech itself, as rather from weariness of mind. And
that may spring either from the cause of which I have already
spoken, namely, the fact that our intelligence is better pleased
and more thoroughly arrested by that which we perceive in silence
in the mind, and that we have no inclination to have our attention
called off from it to a noise of words coming far short of
representing it; or from the circumstance that even when discourse
is pleasant, we have more delight in hearing or reading things
which have been expressed in a superior manner, and which are set
forth without any care or anxiety on our part, than in putting
together, with a view to the comprehension of others, words
suddenly conceived, and leaving it an uncertain issue, on the one
hand, whether such terms occur to us as adequately represent the
sense, and on the other, whether they be accepted in such
<pb n="293" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_293.html" id="iv.iii.xi-Page_293"/>a
manner as to profit; or yet again, from the consideration that, in
consequence of their being now thoroughly familiar to ourselves,
and no longer necessary to our own advancement, it becomes irksome
to us to be recurring very frequently to those matters which are
urged upon the uninstructed, and our mind, as being by this time
pretty well matured, moves with no manner of pleasure in the circle
of subjects so well-worn, and, as it were, so childish. A sense of
weariness is also induced upon the speaker when he has a hearer who
remains unmoved, either in that he is actually not stirred by any
feeling, or in that he does not indicate by any motion of the body
that he understands or that he is pleased with what is said.<note place="end" n="1392" id="iv.iii.xi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xi-p3"> The sentence, &#8220;either in that
he is actually not stirred&#8230;by what is said,&#8221; is omitted in many
<span class="c19" id="iv.iii.xi-p3.1">mss</span>.</p></note> Not that
it is a becoming disposition in us to be greedy of the praises of
men, but that the things which we minister are of God; and the more
we love those to whom we discourse, the more desirous are we that
they should be pleased with the matters which are held forth for
their salvation: so that if we do not succeed in this, we are
pained, and we are weakened, and become broken-spirited in the
midst of our course, as if we were wasting our efforts to no
purpose. Sometimes, too, when we are drawn off from some matter
which we are desirous to go on with, and the transaction of which
was a pleasure to us, or appeared to be more than usually needful,
and when we are compelled, either by the command of a person whom
we are unwilling to offend, or by the importunity of some parties
that we find it impossible to get rid of, to instruct any one
catechetically, in such circumstances we approach a duty for which
great calmness is indispensable with minds already perturbed, and
grieving at once that we are not permitted to keep that order which
we desire to observe in our actions, and that we cannot possibly be
competent for all things; and thus out of very heaviness our
discourse as it advances is less of an attraction, because,
starting from the arid soil of dejection, it goes on less
flowingly. Sometimes, too, sadness has taken possession of our
heart in consequence of some offense or other, and at that very
time we are addressed thus: &#8220;Come, speak with this person; he
desires to become a Christian.&#8221; For they who thus address us do
it in ignorance of the hidden trouble which is consuming us within.
So it happens that, if they are not the persons to whom it befits
us to open up our feelings, we undertake with no sense of pleasure
what they desire; and then, certainly, the discourse will be
languid and unenjoyable which is transmitted through the agitated
and fuming channel of a heart in that condition. Consequently,
seeing there are so many causes serving to cloud the calm serenity
of our minds, in accordance with God&#8217;s will we must seek remedies
for them, such as may bring us relief from these feelings of
heaviness, and help us to rejoice in fervor of spirit, and to be
jocund in the tranquility of a good work. &#8220;For God loveth a
cheerful giver.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1393" id="iv.iii.xi-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xi-p4"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. ix. 7" id="iv.iii.xi-p4.2" parsed="|2Cor|9|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.7">2 Cor. ix. 7</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xi-p5">15. Now if the cause of our sadness
lies in the circumstance that our hearer does not apprehend what we
mean, so that we have to come down in a certain fashion from the
elevation of our own conceptions, and are under the necessity of
dwelling long in the tedious processes of syllables which come far
beneath the standard of our ideas, and have anxiously to consider
how that which we ourselves take in with a most rapid draught of
mental apprehension is to be given forth by the mouth of flesh in
the long and perplexed intricacies of its method of enunciation;
and if the great dissimilarity thus felt (between our utterance and
our thought) makes it distasteful to us to speak, and a pleasure to
us to keep silence, then let us ponder what has been set before us
by Him who has &#8220;showed us an example that we should follow His
steps.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1394" id="iv.iii.xi-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xi-p6"> <scripRef passage="1 Pet. ii. 21" id="iv.iii.xi-p6.2" parsed="|1Pet|2|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Pet.2.21">1 Pet. ii. 21</scripRef></p></note> For

lowest objects, finds its way back, with all the greater vigor to

which witnesses that it has sought nothing from those to whom it

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xii-p2">16. If, however, it is rather our
desire to read or hear such things as are already prepared for our
use and expressed in a superior style, and if the consequence is
that we feel it irksome to put together, at the time and with an
uncertain issue, the terms of discourse on our own side, then,
provided only that our mind does not wander off from the truth of
the facts themselves, it is an easy matter for the hearer, if he is
offended by anything in our language, to come to see in that very
circumstance how little value should be set, supposing the subject
itself to be rightly understood, upon the mere fact that there may
have been some imperfection or some inaccuracy in the literal
expressions, which were employed indeed simply with the view of
securing a correct apprehension of the subject-matter. But if the
bent of human infirmity has wandered off from the truth of the
facts themselves,&#8212;although in the catechetical instruction of the
unlearned, where we have to keep by the most beaten track, that
cannot occur very readily,&#8212;still, lest haply it should turn out
that our hearer finds cause of offence even in this direction, we
ought not to deem this to have come upon us in any other way than
as the issue of God&#8217;s own wish to put us to the test with respect
to our readiness to receive correction in calmness of mind, so as
not to rush headlong, in the course of a still greater error, into
the defense of our error. But if, again, no one has told us of it,
and if the thing has altogether escaped our own notice, as well as
the observation of our hearers, then there is nothing to grieve
over, provided only the same thing does not occur a second time.
For the most part, however, when we recall what we have said, we
ourselves discover something to find fault with, and are ignorant
of the manner in which it was received when it was uttered; and so
when charity is fervent within us, we are the more vexed if the
thing, while really false, has been received with unquestioning
acceptance. This being the case, then, whenever an opportunity
occurs, as we have been finding fault with ourselves in silence, we
ought in like manner to see to it that those persons be also set
right on the subject in a considerate method, who have fallen into
some sort of error, not by the words of God, but plainly by those
used by us. If, on the other hand, there are any who, blinded by
insensate spite, rejoice that we have committed a mistake,
whisperers as they are, and slanderers, and &#8220;hateful to God,&#8221;<note place="end" n="1401" id="iv.iii.xii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xii-p3"> Cf.

rejoice, after the evil likeness and pattern of the devil, in the
evil of another? At times, too, even when all is correctly and
truly spoken, either something which has not been understood, or
something which, as being opposed to the idea and wont of an old
error, seems harsh in its very novelty, offends and disturbs the
hearer. But if this becomes apparent, and if the person shows
himself capable of being set right, he should be set right without
any delay by the use of abundance of authorities and reasons. On
the other hand, if the offense is tacit and hidden, the medicine of
God is the effective remedy for it. And if, again, the person
starts back and declines to be cured, we should comfort ourselves
with that example of our Lord, who, when men were offended at His
word, and shrank from it as a hard saying, addressed Himself at the
same time to those who had remained, in these terms, &#8220;Will ye

effect of which is to make us inclined to set a greater value upon
it than upon the discourse which we ourselves have to deliver, and
so to lead us to speak with a reluctant or tedious utterance, will
come upon us in a happier spirit, and will be found to be more
enjoyable after labor. Then, too, with a stronger confidence shall
we pray to God to speak to us as we wish, if we cheerfully submit
to let Him speak by us as we are able. Thus is it brought about
that all things come together for good to them that love God.<note place="end" n="1407" id="iv.iii.xii-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xii-p9"> <i>Concurrant in

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xiii-p2">17. Once more, however, we often
feel it very wearisome to go over repeatedly matters which are
thoroughly familiar, and adapted (rather) to children. If this is
the case with us, then we should endeavor to meet them with a
brother&#8217;s, a father&#8217;s, and a mother&#8217;s love; and, if we are
once united with them thus in heart, to us no less than to them
will these things seem new. For so great is the power of a
sympathetic disposition of mind, that, as they are affected while
we are speaking, and we are affected while they are learning, we
have our dwelling in each other; and thus, at one and the same
time, they as it were in us speak what they hear, and we in them
learn after a certain fashion what we teach. Is it not a common
occurrence with us, that when we show to persons, who have never
seen them, certain spacious and beautiful tracts, either in cities
or in fields, which we have been in the habit of passing by without
any sense of pleasure, simply because we have become so accustomed
to the sight of them, we find our own enjoyment renewed in their
enjoyment of the novelty of the scene? And this is so much the more
our experience in proportion to the intimacy of our friendship with
them; because, just as we are in them in virtue of the bond of
love, in the same degree do things become new to us which
previously were old. But if we ourselves have made any considerable
progress in the contemplative study of things, it is not our wish
that those whom we love should simply be gratified and astonished
as they gaze upon the works of men&#8217;s hands; but it becomes our
wish to lift them to (the contemplation of) the very skill<note place="end" n="1408" id="iv.iii.xiii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xiii-p3"> Some editions read <i>arcem</i> =
stronghold, instead of <i>artem</i>.</p></note> or wisdom

How much more, then, ought we to be delighted when men come to us
with the purpose already formed of obtaining the knowledge of God
Himself, with a view to (the knowledge of) whom all things should
be learned which are to be learned! And how ought we to feel
ourselves renewed in their newness (of experience), so that if our
ordinary preaching is somewhat frigid, it may rise to fresh warmth
under (the stimulus of) their extraordinary hearing! There is also
this additional consideration to help us in the attainment of
gladness, namely, that we ponder and bear in mind out of what death
of error the man is passing over into the life of faith. And if we
walk through streets which are most familiar to us, with a
beneficent cheerfulness, when we happen to be pointing out the way
to some individual who had been in distress in consequence of
missing his direction, how much more should be the alacrity of
spirit, and how much greater the joy with which, in the matter of
saving doctrine, we ought to traverse again and again even those
tracks which, so far as we are ourselves concerned, there is no
need to open up any more; seeing that we are leading a miserable
soul, and one worn out with the devious courses of this world,
through the paths of peace, at the command of Him who made that
peace<note place="end" n="1410" id="iv.iii.xiii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xiii-p5"> Instead of <i>eam</i>, the

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xiv-p2">18. But in good truth it is a
serious demand to make upon us, to continue discoursing on to the
set limit when we fail to see our hearer in any degree moved;
whether it be that, under the restraints of the awe of religion, he
has not the boldness to signify his approval by voice or by any
movement of his body, or that he is kept back by the modesty proper
to man,<note place="end" n="1411" id="iv.iii.xiv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xiv-p3"> Or = by the reverence which he
feels for the man: <i>humana verecundia</i>.</p></note> or that he
does not understand our sayings, or that he counts them of no
value. Since, then, this must be a matter of uncertainty to us, as
we cannot discern his mind, it becomes our duty in our discourse to
make trial of all things which may be of any avail in stirring him
up and drawing him forth as it were from his place of concealment.
For that sort of fear which is excessive, and which obstructs the
declaration of his judgment, ought to be dispelled by the force of
kindly exhortation; and by bringing before him the consideration of
our brotherly affinity, we should temper his reverence for us; and
by questioning him, we should ascertain whether he understands what
is addressed to him; and we should impart to him a sense of
confidence, so that he may give free expression to any objection
which suggests itself to him. We should at the same time ask him
whether he has already listened to such themes on some previous
occasion, and whether perchance they fail to move him now in
consequence of their being to him like things well known and
commonplace. And we ought to shape our course in accordance with
his answer, so as either to speak in a simpler style and with
greater detail of explanation, or to refute some antagonistic
opinion, or, instead of attempting any more diffuse exposition of
the subjects which are known to him, to give a brief summary of
these, and to select some of those matters which are handled in a
mystical manner in the holy books, and especially in the historical
narrative, the unfolding and setting forth of which may make our
addresses more attractive. But if the man is of a very sluggish
disposition, and if he is senseless, and without anything in common
with all such sources of pleasure, then we must simply bear with
him in a compassionate spirit; and, after briefly going over other
points, we ought to impress upon him, in a manner calculated to
inspire him with awe, the truths which are most indispensable on
the subject of the unity of the Catholic Church,<note place="end" n="1412" id="iv.iii.xiv-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xiv-p4"> The text gives simply <i>
Catholic&#230;</i>. One <span class="c19" id="iv.iii.xiv-p4.1">ms</span>. has <i>Catholic&#230;

<i>Ecclesi&#230;</i>.</p></note> on that of temptation, on that of
a Christian conversation in view of the future judgment; and we
ought rather to address ourselves to God for him than address much
to him concerning God.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xiv-p5">19. It is likewise a frequent
occurrence that one who at first listened to us with all readiness,
becomes exhausted either by the effort of hearing or by standing,
and now no longer commends what is said, but gapes and yawns, and
even unwillingly exhibits a disposition to depart. When we observe
that, it becomes our duty to refresh his mind by saying something
seasoned with an honest cheerfulness and adapted to the matter
which is being discussed, or something of a very wonderful and
amazing order, or even, it may be, something of a painful and
mournful nature. Whatever we thus say may be all the better if it
affects himself more immediately, so that the quick sense of
self-concern may keep his attention on the alert. At the same time,
however, it should not be of the kind to offend his spirit of
reverence by any harshness attaching to it; but it should be of a
nature fitted rather to conciliate him by the friendliness which it
breathes. Or else, we should relieve him by accommodating him with
a seat, although unquestionably matters will be better ordered if
from the outset, whenever that can be done with propriety, he sits
and listens. And indeed in certain of the churches beyond the sea,
with a far more considerate regard to the fitness of things, not
only do the prelates sit when they address the people, but they
also themselves put down seats for the people, lest any person of
enfeebled strength should become exhausted by standing, and thus
have his mind diverted from the most wholesome purport (of the
discourse), or even be under the necessity of departing. And yet it
is one thing if it be simply some one out of a great multitude who
withdraws in order to recruit his strength, he being also already
under the obligations which result from participation in the
sacraments; and it is quite another thing if the person withdrawing
is one (inasmuch as it is usually the case in these circumstances
that the man is unavoidably urged to that course by the fear that
he should even fall, overcome by internal weakness) who has to be
initiated in the first sacraments; for a person in this position is
at once restrained by the sense of shame from stating the reason of
his going, and not permitted to stand through the force of his
weakness. This I speak from experience. For this was the case with
a certain individual, a man from the country, when I was
instructing him catechetically: and from 
<pb n="297" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_297.html" id="iv.iii.xiv-Page_297"/>his instance I have
learned that this kind of thing is carefully to be guarded against.
For who can endure our arrogance when we fail to make men who are
our brethren,<note place="end" n="1413" id="iv.iii.xiv-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xiv-p6"> Instead of <i>viros fratres</i>,
some <span class="c19" id="iv.iii.xiv-p6.1">mss.</span> read <i>veros fratres</i> = our
genuine brethren.</p></note> or even
those who are not yet in that relation to us (for our solicitude
then should be all the greater to get them to become our brethren),
to be seated in our presence, seeing that even a woman sat as she
listened to our Lord Himself, in whose service the angels stand
alert?<note place="end" n="1414" id="iv.iii.xiv-p6.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xiv-p7"> <scripRef passage="Luke x. 39" id="iv.iii.xiv-p7.2" parsed="|Luke|10|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.10.39">Luke x. 39</scripRef></p></note> Of course
if the address is to be but short, or if the place is not well
adapted for sitting, they should listen standing. But that should
be the case only when there are many hearers, and when they are not
to be formally admitted<note place="end" n="1415" id="iv.iii.xiv-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xiv-p8"> <i>Initiandi</i> = initiated.</p></note> at the time. For when the audience
consists only of one or two, or a few, who have come with the
express purpose of being made Christians, there is a risk in
speaking to them standing. Nevertheless, supposing that we have
once begun in that manner, we ought at least, whenever we observe
signs of weariness on the part of the hearer, to offer him the
liberty of being seated; nay more, we should urge him by all means
to sit down, and we ought to drop some remark calculated at once to
refresh him and to banish from his mind any anxiety which may have
chanced to break in upon him and draw off his attention. For
inasmuch as the reasons why he remains silent and declines to
listen cannot be certainly known to us, now that he is seated we
may speak to some extent against the incidence of thoughts about
worldly affairs, delivering ourselves either in the cheerful spirit
to which I have already adverted, or in a serious vein; so that, if
these are the particular anxieties which have occupied his mind,
they may be made to give way as if indicted by name: while, on the
other hand, supposing them not to be the special causes (of the
loss of interest), and supposing him to be simply worn out with
listening, his attention will be relieved of the pressure of
weariness when we address to him some unexpected and extraordinary
strain of remark on these subjects, in the mode of which I have
spoken, as if they were the particular anxieties,&#8212;for indeed we
are simply ignorant (of the true causes). But let the remark thus
made be short, especially considering that it is thrown in out of
order, lest the very medicine even increase the malady of weariness
which we desire to relieve; and, at the same time, we should go on
rapidly with what remains, and promise and present the prospect of
a conclusion nearer than was looked for.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xv-p2">20. If, again, your spirit has been
broken by the necessity of giving up some other employment, on
which, as the more requisite, you were now bent; and if the sadness
caused by that constraint makes you catechise in no pleasant mood,
you ought to ponder the fact that, excepting that we know it to be
our duty, in all our dealings with men, to act in a merciful
manner, and in the exercise of the sincerest charity,&#8212;with this
one exception, I say, it is quite uncertain to us what is the more
profitable thing for us to do, and what the more opportune thing
for us either to pass by for a time or altogether to omit. For
inasmuch as we know not how the merits of men, on whose behalf we
are acting, stand with God, the question as to what is expedient
for them at a certain time is something which, instead of being
able to comprehend, we can rather only surmise, without the aid of
any (clear) inferences, or (at best) with the slenderest and the
most uncertain. Therefore we ought certainly to dispose the matters
with which we have to deal according to our intelligence; and then,
if we prove able to carry them out in the manner upon which we have
resolved, we should rejoice, not indeed that it was our will, but
that it was God&#8217;s will, that they should thus be accomplished.
But if anything unavoidable happens, by which the disposition thus
proposed by us is interfered with, we should bend ourselves to it
readily, lest we be broken; so that the very disposition of affairs
which God has preferred to ours may also be made our own. For it is
more in accordance with propriety that we should follow His will
than that He should follow ours. Besides, as regards this order in
the doing of things, which we wish to keep in accordance with our
own judgment, surely that course is to be approved of in which
objects that are superior have the precedence. Why then are we
aggrieved that the precedence over men should be held by the Lord
God in His vast superiority to us men, so that in the said love
which we entertain for our own order, we should thus (exhibit the
disposition to) despise order? For &#8220;no one orders for the
better&#8221; what he has to do, except the man who is rather ready to
leave undone what he is prohibited from doing by the divine power,
than desirous of doing that which he meditates in his own human
cogitations. For &#8220;there are many devices in a man&#8217;s heart;
nevertheless, the counsel of the Lord stands for ever.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1416" id="iv.iii.xv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xv-p3"> <scripRef passage="Prov. xix. 21" id="iv.iii.xv-p3.2" parsed="|Prov|19|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.19.21">Prov. xix. 21</scripRef></p></note></p><pb n="298" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_298.html" id="iv.iii.xv-Page_298"/>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xv-p4">21. But if our mind is agitated by some cause of
offense, so as not to be capable of delivering a discourse of a
calm and enjoyable strain, our charity towards those for whom
Christ died, desiring to redeem them by the price of His own blood
from the death of the errors of this world, ought to be so great,
that the very circumstance of intelligence being brought us in our
sadness, regarding the advent of some person who longs to become a
Christian, ought to be enough to cheer us and dissipate that
heaviness of spirit, just as the delights of gain are wont to
soften the pain of losses. For we are not (fairly) oppressed by the
offense of any individual, unless it be that of the man whom we
either perceive or believe to be perishing himself, or to be the
occasion of the undoing of some weak one. Accordingly, one who
comes to us with the view of being formally admitted, in that we
cherish the hope of his ability to go forward, should wipe away the
sorrow caused by one who fails us. For even if the dread that our
proselyte may become the child of hell<note place="end" n="1417" id="iv.iii.xv-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xv-p5"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 23.15" id="iv.iii.xv-p5.1" parsed="|Matt|23|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.15">Matt. xxiii. 15</scripRef></p></note> comes into our thoughts, as, there
are many such before our eyes, from whom those offenses arise by
which we are distressed, this ought to operate, not in the way of
keeping us back, but rather in the way of stimulating us and
spurring us on. And in the same measure we ought to admonish him
whom we are instructing to be on his guard against imitating those
who are Christians only in name and not in very truth, and to take
care not to suffer himself to be so moved by their numbers as
either to be desirous of following them, or to be reluctant to
follow Christ on their account, and either to be unwilling to be in
the Church of God, where they are, or to wish to be there in such a
character as they bear. And somehow or other, in admonitions of
this sort, that address is the more glowing to which a present
sense of grief supplies the fuel; so that instead of being duller,
we utter with greater fire and vehemence under such feelings things
which, in times of greater ease, we would give forth in a colder
and less energetic manner. And this should make us rejoice that an
opportunity is afforded us under which the emotions of our mind
pass not away without yielding some fruit.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xv-p6">22. If, however, grief has taken
possession of us on account of something in which we ourselves have
erred or sinned, we should bear in mind not only that a &#8220;broken
spirit is a sacrifice to God,&#8221;<note place="end" n="1418" id="iv.iii.xv-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xv-p7"> <scripRef passage="Ps. li. 17" id="iv.iii.xv-p7.2" parsed="|Ps|51|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.51.17">Ps. li. 17</scripRef></p></note> but also the saying, &#8220;Like as

account, when an opportunity has been given for a most merciful
work, we should rejoice in it, as if a fountain were offered us in
order that by it the conflagration which had burst forth might be
extinguished. Unless haply we are foolish enough to think that we
ought to be readier in running with bread, wherewith we may fill
the belly of a hungry man, than with the word of God, wherewith we
may instruct the mind of the man who feeds on it.<note place="end" n="1422" id="iv.iii.xv-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xv-p11"> Reading <i>istud edentis</i>; for

a neighbor, but of ourselves. But when from the mouth of the Lord

darkness of weary feelings, the bent of mind is rendered apt for
the duty of catechising, so that that is received in a pleasant
manner which breaks forth vigorously and cheerfully from the rich
vein of charity. For these things indeed which are uttered here are
spoken, not so much by me to you, as rather to us all by that very

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xvi-p2">23. But now, perhaps, you also
demand of me as a debt that which, previous to the promise which I
made, I was under no obligation to give, namely, that I should not
count it burdensome to unfold some sort of example of the discourse
intended, and to set it before you for your study, just as if I
were my<pb n="299" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_299.html" id="iv.iii.xvi-Page_299"/>self engaged in catechising some individual. Before I do
that, however, I wish you to keep in mind the fact that the mental
effort is of one kind in the case of a person who dictates, with a
future reader in his view, and that it is of quite another kind in
the case of a person who speaks with a present hearer to whom to
direct his attention. And further, it is to be remembered that, in
this latter instance in particular, the effort is of one kind when
one is admonishing in private, and when there is no other person at
hand to pronounce judgment on us; whereas it is of a different
order when one is conveying any instruction in public, and when
there stands around him an audience of persons holding dissimilar
opinions; and again, that in this exercise of teaching, the effort
will be of one sort when only a single individual is being
instructed, while all the rest listen, like persons judging or
attesting things well known to them, and that it will be different
when all those who are present wait for what we have to deliver to
them; and once more, that, in this same instance, the effort will
be one thing when all are seated, as it were, in private conference
with a view to engaging in some discussion, and that it will be
quite another thing when the people sit silent and intent on giving
their attention to some single speaker who is to address them from
a higher position. It will likewise make a considerable difference,
even when we are discoursing in that style, whether there are few
present or many, whether they are learned or unlearned, or made up
of both classes combined; whether they are city-bred or rustics, or
both the one and the other together; or whether, again, they are a
people composed of all orders of men in due proportion. For it is
impossible but that they will affect in different ways the person
who has to speak to them and discourse with them, and that the
address which is delivered will both bear certain features, as it
were, expressive of the feelings of the mind from which it
proceeds, and also influence the hearers in different ways, in
accordance with that same difference (in the speaker&#8217;s
disposition), while at the same time the hearers themselves will
influence one another in different ways by the simple force of
their presence with each other. But as we are dealing at present
with the matter of the instruction of the unlearned, I am a witness
to you, as regards my own experience, that I find myself variously
moved, according as I see before me, for the purposes of
catechetical instruction, a highly educated man, a dull fellow, a
citizen, a foreigner, a rich man, a poor man, a private individual,
a man of honors, a person occupying some position of authority, an
individual of this or the other nation, of this or the other age or
sex, one proceeding from this or the other sect, from this or the
other common error,&#8212;and ever in accordance with the difference of
my feelings does my discourse itself at once set out, go on, and
reach its end. And inasmuch as, although the same charity is due to
all, yet the same medicine is not to be administered to all, in
like manner charity itself travails with some, is made weak
together with others; is at pains to edify some, tremblingly
apprehends being an offense to others; bends to some, lifts itself
erect to others; is gentle to some, severe to others; to none an
enemy, to all a mother. And when one, who has not gone through the
kind of experience to which I refer in the same spirit of charity,
sees us attaining, in virtue of some gift which has been conferred

First, the Case of a Catechumen with Worthy Views.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xvii-p2">24. Nevertheless, however that may
be, let us here suppose that some one has come to us who desires to
be made a Christian, and who belongs indeed to the order of private
persons,<note place="end" n="1428" id="iv.iii.xvii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xvii-p3"> <i>Idiotarum</i></p></note> and yet
not to the class of rustics, but to that of the city-bred, such as
those whom you cannot fail to come across in numbers in Carthage.
Let us also suppose that, on being asked whether the inducement
leading him to desire to be a Christian is any advantage looked for
in the present life, or the rest which is hoped for after this
life, he has answered that his inducement has been the rest that is
yet to come. Then perchance such a person might be instructed by us
in some such strain of address as the following: <pb n="300" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_300.html" id="iv.iii.xvii-Page_300"/>&#8220;Thanks be
to God, my brother; cordially do I wish you joy, and I am glad on
your account that, amid all the storms of this world, which are at
once so great and so dangerous, you have bethought yourself of some
true and certain security. For even in this life men go in quest of
rest and security at the cost of heavy labors, but they fail to
find such in consequence of their wicked lusts. For their thought
is to find rest in things which are unquiet, and which endure not.
And these objects, inasmuch as they are withdrawn from them and
pass away in the course of time, agitate them by fears and griefs,
and suffer them not to enjoy tranquillity. For if it be that a man
seeks to find his rest in wealth, he is rendered proud rather than
at ease. Do we not see how many have lost their riches on a
sudden,&#8212;how many, too, have been undone by reason of them, either
as they have been coveting to possess them, or as they have been
borne down and despoiled of them by others more covetous than
themselves? And even should they remain with the man all his life
long, and never leave their lover, yet would he himself (have to)
leave them at his death. For of what measure is the life of man,
even if he lives to old age? Or when men desire for themselves old
age, what else do they really desire but long infirmity? So, too,
with the honors of this world,&#8212;what are they but empty pride and
vanity, and peril of ruin? For holy Scripture speaks in this wise:
&#8216;All flesh is grass, and the glory of man is as the flower of
grass. The grass withereth, the flower thereof falleth away; but
the word of the Lord endureth for ever.&#8217;<note place="end" n="1429" id="iv.iii.xvii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xvii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Isa. xl. 6, 8" id="iv.iii.xvii-p4.2" parsed="|Isa|40|6|0|0;|Isa|40|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.40.6 Bible:Isa.40.8">Isa. xl. 6, 8</scripRef>; <scripRef passage="1 Pet. i. 24, 25" id="iv.iii.xvii-p4.3" parsed="|1Pet|1|24|1|25" osisRef="Bible:1Pet.1.24-1Pet.1.25">1

true rest and true felicity, he ought to lift his hope off things
which are mortal and transitory, and fix it on the word of the
Lord; so that, cleaving to that which endures for ever, he may
himself together with it endure for ever.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xvii-p5">25. &#8220;There are also other men who
neither crave to be rich nor go about seeking the vain pomps of
honors, but who nevertheless are minded to find their pleasure and
rest in dainty meats, and in fornications, and in those theatres
and spectacles which are at their disposal in great cities for
nothing. But it fares with these, too, in the same way; or they
waste their small means in luxury, and subsequently, under pressure
of want, break out into thefts and burglaries, and at times even
into highway robberies, and so they are suddenly filled with fears
both numerous and great; and men who a little before were singing
in the house of revelry, are now dreaming of the sorrows of the
prison. Moreover, in their eager devotion to the public spectacles,
they come to resemble demons, as they incite men by their cries to
wound each other, and instigate those who have done them no hurt to
engage in furious contests with each other, while they seek to
please an insane people. And if they perceive any such to be
peaceably disposed, they straightway hate them and persecute them,
and raise an outcry, asking that they should be beaten with clubs,
as if they had been in collusion to cheat them; and this iniquity
they force even the judge, who is the (appointed) avenger of
iniquities, to perpetrate. On the other hand, if they observe such
men exerting themselves in horrid hostilities against each other,

struggles, not only men with men, but even men with beasts,&#8212;then
the fiercer the fury with which they perceive these unhappy
creatures rage against each other, the better they like them, and
the greater the enjoyment they have in them; and they favor them
when thus excited,<note place="end" n="1432" id="iv.iii.xvii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xvii-p8"> Reading <i>incitatis favent</i>,
for which some <span class="c19" id="iv.iii.xvii-p8.1">mss</span>. give <i>incitati</i> =

incitantes</i> = exciting them, they favor them.</p></note> and by so favoring them they
excite them all the more, the spectators themselves striving more
madly with each other, as they espouse the cause of different
combatants, than is the case even with those very men whose madness
they madly provoke, while at the same time they also long to be
spectators of the same in their mad frenzy.<note place="end" n="1433" id="iv.iii.xvii-p8.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xvii-p9"> Compare a passage in the <i>
Confessions</i>, vi. 13.</p></note> How then can that mind keep the
soundness of peace which feeds on strifes and contentions? For just
as is the food which is received, such is the health which results.
In fine, although mad pleasures are no pleasures, nevertheless let
these things be taken as they are, and it still remains the case
that, whatever their nature may be, and whatever the measure of
enjoyment yielded by the boasts of riches, and the inflation of
honors, and the spendthrift pleasures of the taverns, and the
contests of the theatres, and the impurity of fornications, and the
pruriency of the baths, they are all things of which one
<pb n="301" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_301.html" id="iv.iii.xvii-Page_301"/>little
fever deprives us, while, even from those who still survive, it
takes away the whole false happiness of their life. Then there
remains only a void and wounded conscience, destined to apprehend
that God as a Judge whom it refused to have as a Father, and
destined also to find a severe Lord in Him whom it scorned to seek
and love as a tender Father. But thou, inasmuch as thou seekest
that true rest which is promised to Christians after this life,
wilt taste the same sweet and pleasant rest even here among the
bitterest troubles of this life, if thou continuest to love the
commandments of Him who hath promised the same. For quickly wilt
thou feel that the fruits of righteousness are sweeter than those
of unrighteousness, and that a man finds a more genuine and
pleasurable joy in the possession of a good conscience in the midst
of troubles than in that of an evil conscience in the midst of
delights. For thou hast not come to be united to the Church of God
with the idea of seeking from it any temporal
advantage.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xviii-p2">26. &#8220;For there are some whose
reason for desiring to become Christians is either that they may
gain the favor of men from whom they look for temporal advantages,
or that they are reluctant to offend those whom they fear. But
these are reprobate; and although the church bears them for a time,
as the threshing-floor bears the chaff until the period of
winnowing, yet if they fail to amend and begin to be Christians in
sincerity in view of the everlasting rest which is to come, they
will be separated from it in the end. And let not such flatter
themselves, because it is possible for them to be in the
threshing-floor along with the grain of God. For they will not be
together with that in the barn, but are destined for the fire,
which is their due. There are also others of better hope indeed,
but nevertheless in no inferior danger. I mean those who now fear
God, and mock not the Christian name, neither enter the church of
God with an assumed heart, but still look for their felicity in
this life, expecting to have more felicity in earthly things than
those enjoy who refuse to worship God. And the consequence of this
false anticipation is, that when they see some wicked and impious
men strongly established and excelling in this worldly prosperity,
while they themselves either possess it in a smaller degree or miss
it altogether, they are troubled with the thought that they are
serving God without reason, and so they readily fall away from the
faith.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xviii-p3">27. &#8220;But as to the man who has in
view that everlasting blessedness and perpetual rest which is
promised as the lot destined for the saints after this life, and
who desires to become a Christian, in order that he may not pass
into eternal fire with the devil, but enter into the eternal
kingdom together with Christ,<note place="end" n="1434" id="iv.iii.xviii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xviii-p4"> Cf.

(and he will be) on his guard in every temptation, so that he may
neither be corrupted by prosperity nor be utterly broken in spirit
by adversity, but remain at once modest and temperate when the good
things of earth abound with him, and brave and patient when
tribulations overtake him. A person of this character will also
advance in attainments until he comes to that disposition of mind
which will make him love God more than he fears hell; so that even
were God to say to him, &#8216;Avail yourself of carnal pleasures for
ever, and sin as much as you are able, and you shall neither die
nor be sent into hell, but you will only not be with me, he would
be terribly dismayed, and would altogether abstain from sinning,
not now (simply) with the purpose of not falling into that of which
he was wont to be afraid, but with the wish not to offend Him whom
he so greatly loves: in whom alone also there is the rest which eye
hath not seen, neither hath ear heard, neither hath it entered into
the heart of man (to conceive),&#8212;the rest which God hath prepared
for them that love Him.<note place="end" n="1435" id="iv.iii.xviii-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xviii-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 9" id="iv.iii.xviii-p5.2" parsed="|1Cor|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.9">1 Cor. ii. 9</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xviii-p6">28. &#8220;Now, on the subject of this
rest Scripture is significant, and refrains not to speak, when it
tells us how at the beginning of the world, and at the time when
God made heaven and earth and all things which are in them, He
worked during six days, and rested on the seventh day.<note place="end" n="1436" id="iv.iii.xviii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xviii-p7"> <scripRef passage="Gen. ii. 1-3" id="iv.iii.xviii-p7.2" parsed="|Gen|2|1|2|3" osisRef="Bible:Gen.2.1-Gen.2.3">Gen. ii. 1&#8211;3</scripRef></p></note> For it was
in the power of the Almighty to make all things even in one moment
of time. For He had not labored in the view that He might enjoy (a
needful) rest, since indeed &#8220;He spake, and they were made; He
commanded, and they were created;&#8221;<note place="end" n="1437" id="iv.iii.xviii-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xviii-p8"> <scripRef passage="Ps. cxlviii. 5" id="iv.iii.xviii-p8.2" parsed="|Ps|148|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.148.5">Ps. cxlviii. 5</scripRef></p></note> but that He might signify how,
after six ages of this world, in a seventh age, as on the seventh
day, He will rest in His saints; inasmuch as these same saints
shall rest also in Him after all the good works in which they have
served Him,&#8212;which He Himself, indeed, works in them, who calls
them, and instructs them, and puts away the offenses that are past,
and justifies the man who previously 
<pb n="302" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_302.html" id="iv.iii.xviii-Page_302"/>was ungodly. For as,
when by His gift they work that which is good, He is Himself
rightly said to work (that in them), so, when they rest in Him, He
is rightly said to rest Himself. For, as regards Himself, He seeks
no cessation, because He feels no labor. Moreover He made all
things by His Word; and His Word is Christ Himself, in whom the
angels and all those purest spirits of heaven rest in holy silence.
Man, however in that he fell by sin, has lost the rest which he
possessed in His divinity, and receives it again (now) in His
humanity; and for this purpose He became man, and was born of a
woman, at the seasonable time at which He Himself knew it behoved
it so to be fulfilled. And from the flesh assuredly He could not
sustain any contamination, being Himself rather destined to purify
the flesh. Of His future coming the ancient saints, in the
revelation of the Spirit, had knowledge, and prophesied. And thus
were they saved by believing that He was to come, even as we are
saved by believing that He has come. Hence ought we to love God who
has so loved us as to have sent His only Son, in order that He
might endue Himself with the lowliness<note place="end" n="1438" id="iv.iii.xviii-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xviii-p9"> <i>Humanitate</i>, = humanity, also occurs instead of <i>

old, and in the opening ages, the depth of this mystery ceases not
to be prefigured and prophetically announced.</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.iii.xix-p1.1">Chapter
18.&#8212;Of What is to Be Believed on the Subject of the Creation of
Man and Other Objects.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xix-p2">29. &#8220;Whereas, then, the
omnipotent God, who is also good and just and merciful, who made
all things,&#8212;whether they be great or small, whether they be
highest or lowest, whether they be things which are seen, such as
are the heavens and the earth and the sea, and in the heavens, in
particular, the sun and the moon and other luminaries, and in the
earth and the sea, again, trees and shrubs and animals each after
their kind, and all bodies celestial or terrestrial alike, or
whether they be things which are not seen, such as are those
spirits whereby bodies are animated and endowed with life,&#8212;made
also man after His own image, in order that, as He Himself, in
virtue of His omnipotence, presides over universal creation, so
man, in virtue of that intelligence of his by which he comes to
know even his Creator and worships Him, might preside over all the
living creatures of earth: Whereas, too, he made the woman to be an
helpmeet for him: not for carnal concupiscence,&#8212;since, indeed,
they had not corruptible bodies at that period, before the
punishment of sin invaded them in the form of mortality,&#8212;but for
this purpose, that the man might at once have glory of the woman in
so far as he went before her to God, and present in himself an
example to her for imitation in holiness and piety, even as he
himself was to be the glory of God in so far as he followed his
wisdom:</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xix-p3">30. &#8220;Therefore did he place them
in a certain locality of perpetual blessedness, which the Scripture
designates Paradise: and he gave them a commandment, on condition
of not violating which they were to continue for ever in that
blessedness of immortality; while, on the other hand, if they
transgressed it, they were to sustain the penalties of mortality.
Now God knew beforehand that they would trangress it. Nevertheless,
in that He is the author and maker of everything good, He chose
rather to make them, as He also made the beasts, in order that He
might replenish the earth with the good things proper to earth. And
certainly man, even sinful man, is better than a beast. And the
commandment, which they were not to keep, He yet preferred to give
them, in order that they might be without excuse when He should
begin to vindicate Himself against them. For whatever man may have
done, he finds God worthy to be praised in all His doings: if he
shall have acted rightly, he finds Him worthy to be praised for the
righteousness of His rewards: if he shall have sinned, he finds Him
worthy to be praised for the righteousness of His punishments: if
he shall have confessed his sins and returned to an upright life,
he finds Him worthy to be praised for the mercy of His pardoning
favors. Why, then, should God not make man, although He foreknew
that he would sin, when He might crown him if he stood, and set him
right if he fell, and help him if he rose, Himself being always and
everywhere glorious in goodness, righteousness, and clemency? Above
all, why should He not do so, since He also foreknew this, namely,
that from the race of that mortality there would spring saints, who
should not seek their own, but give glory to their Creator; and
who, obtaining deliverance from every corruption by worshipping
Him, should be counted worthy to live for ever, and to live in
blessedness with the holy angels? For He who gave freedom of will
to men, in order that they might worship God not of slavish
necessity but with ingenuous inclination, gave it also to the
angels; and hence neither did the angel, who, in com<pb n="303" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_303.html" id="iv.iii.xix-Page_303"/>pany with
other spirits who were his satellites, forsook in pride the
obedience of God and became the devil, do any hurt to God, but to
himself. For God knoweth how to dispose of souls<note place="end" n="1439" id="iv.iii.xix-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xix-p4"> Rather &#8220;spirits.&#8221; See the

righteous misery to furnish the inferior sections of His creatures
with the most appropriate and befitting laws of His wonderful
dispensation. Consequently, neither did the devil in any manner
harm God, whether in falling himself, or in seducing man to death;
nor did man himself in any degree impair the truth, or power, or
blessedness<note place="end" n="1440" id="iv.iii.xix-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xix-p5"> The <i>beatitatem</i> is omitted

Maker, in that, when his partner was seduced by the devil, he of
his own deliberate inclination consented unto her in the doing of
that which God had forbidden. For by the most righteous laws of God
all were condemned, God Himself being glorious in the equity of
retribution, while they were shamed through the degradation of
punishment: to the end that man, when he turned away from his
Creator, should be overcome by the devil and made his subject, and
that the devil might be set before man as an enemy to be conquered,
when he turned again to his Creator; so that whosoever should
consent unto the devil even to the end, might go with him into
eternal punishments; whereas those who should humble themselves to
God, and by His grace overcome the devil, might be counted worthy
of eternal rewards.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xx-p2">31. &#8220;Neither ought we to be moved
by the consideration that many consent unto the devil, and few
follow God; for the grain, too, in comparison with the chaff, has
greatly the defect in number. But even as the husbandman knows what
to do with the mighty heap of chaff, so the multitude of sinners is
nothing to God, who knows what to do with them, so as not to let
the administration of His kingdom be disordered and dishonored in
any part. Nor is the devil to be supposed to have proved victorious
for the mere reason of his drawing away with him more than the few
by whom he may be overcome. In this way there are two
communities&#8212;one of the ungodly, and another of the holy&#8212;which
are carried down from the beginning of the human race even to the
end of the world, which are at present commingled in respect of
bodies, but separated in respect of wills, and which, moreover, are
destined to be separated also in respect of bodily presence in the
day of judgment. For all men who love pride and temporal power with
vain elation and pomp of arrogance, and all spirits who set their
affections on such things and seek their own glory in the
subjection of men, are bound fast together in one association; nay,
even although they frequently fight against each other on account
of these things, they are nevertheless precipitated by the like
weight of lust into the same abyss, and are united with each other
by similarity of manners and merits. And, again, all men and all
spirits who humbly seek the glory of God and not their own, and who
follow Him in piety, belong to one fellowship. And, notwithstanding
this, God is most merciful and patient with ungodly men, and offers
them a place for penitence and amendment.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xx-p3">32. &#8220;For with respect also to the
fact that He destroyed all men in the flood, with the exception of
one righteous man together with his house, whom He willed to be
saved in the ark, He knew indeed that they would not amend
themselves; yet, nevertheless, as the building of the ark went on
for the space of a hundred years, the wrath of God which was to
come upon them was certainly preached to them:<note place="end" n="1441" id="iv.iii.xx-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xx-p4"> <scripRef passage="Gen. vi. 7" id="iv.iii.xx-p4.2" parsed="|Gen|6|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.6.7">Gen. vi. 7</scripRef></p></note> and if they only would have turned
to God, He would have spared them, as at a later period He spared
the city of Nineveh when it repented, after He had announced to it,
by means of a prophet, the destruction that was about to overtake
it.<note place="end" n="1442" id="iv.iii.xx-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xx-p5"> <scripRef passage="Jonah 3" id="iv.iii.xx-p5.1" parsed="|Jonah|3|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jonah.3">Jonah iii</scripRef></p></note> Thus,
moreover, God acts, granting a space for repentance even to those
who He knows will persist in wickedness, in order that He may
exercise and instruct our patience by His own example; whereby also
we may know how greatly it befits us to bear with the evil in
long-suffering, when we know not what manner of men they will prove
hereafter, seeing that He, whose cognizance nothing that is yet to
be escapes, spares them and suffers them to live. Under the
sacramental sign of the flood, however, in which the righteous were
rescued by the wood, there was also a fore-announcement of the
Church which was to be, which Christ, its King and God, has raised
on high; by the mystery of His cross, in safety from the submersion
of this world. Moreover, God was not ignorant of the fact that,
even of those who had been saved in the ark, there would be born
wicked men, who would cover the face of the earth a second time
with iniquities. But, nevertheless, He both gave them a pattern of
the future judgment, and fore-announced the deliverance of the holy
by the <pb n="304" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_304.html" id="iv.iii.xx-Page_304"/>mystery of the wood. For even after these things
wickedness did not cease to sprout forth again through pride, and
lusts, and illicit impieties, when men, forsaking their Creator,
not only fell to the (standard of the) creature which God made, so
as to worship instead of God that which God made, but even bowed
their souls to the works of the hands of men and to the
contrivances of craftsmen, wherein a more shameful triumph was to
be won over them by the devil, and by those evil spirits who
rejoice in finding themselves adored and reverenced in such false
devices, while they feed<note place="end" n="1443" id="iv.iii.xx-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xx-p6"> Instead of <i>pascunt</i> the
reading <i>miscent</i>, = mix, is also found.</p></note> their own errors with the errors
of men.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xx-p7">33. &#8220;But in truth there were not
wanting in those times righteous men also of the kind to seek God
piously and to overcome the pride of the devil, citizens of that
holy community, who were made whole by the humiliation of Christ,
which was then only destined to enter, but was revealed to them by
the Spirit. From among these, Abraham, a pious and faithful servant
of God, was chosen, in order that to him might be shown the
sacrament of the Son of God, so that thus, in virtue of the
imitation of his faith, all the faithful of all nations might be
called his children in the future. Of him was born a people, by
whom the one true God who made heaven and earth should be
worshipped when all other nations did service to idols and evil
spirits. In that people, plainly, the future Church was much more
evidently prefigured. For in it there was a carnal multitude that
worshipped God with a view to visible benefits. But in it there
were also a few who thought of the future rest, and looked
longingly for the heavenly fatherland, to whom through prophecy was
revealed the coming humiliation of God in the person of our King
and Lord Jesus Christ, in order that they might be made whole of
all pride and arrogance through that faith. And with respect to
these saints who in point of time had precedence of the birth of
the Lord, not only their speech, but also their life, and their
marriages, and their children, and their doings, constituted a
prophecy of this time, at which the Church is being gathered
together out of all nations through faith in the passion of Christ.
By the instrumentality of those holy patriarchs and prophets this
carnal people of Israel, who at a later period were also called
Jews, had ministered unto them at once those visible benefits which
they eagerly desired of the Lord in a carnal manner, and those
chastisements, in the form of bodily punishments, which were
intended to terrify them for the time, as was befitting for their
obstinacy. And in all these, nevertheless, there were also
spiritual mysteries signified, such as were meant to bear upon
Christ and the Church; of which Church those saints also were
members, although they existed in this life previous to the birth
of Christ, the Lord, according to the flesh. For this same Christ,
the only-begotten Son of God, the Word of the Father, equal and
co-eternal with the Father, by whom all things were made, was
Himself also made man for our sakes, in order that of the whole
Church, as of His whole body, He might be the Head. But just as
when the whole man is in the process of being born, although he may
put the hand forth first in the act of birth, yet is that hand
joined and compacted together with the whole body under the head,
even as also among these same patriarchs some were born<note place="end" n="1444" id="iv.iii.xx-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xx-p8"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xxv. 26" id="iv.iii.xx-p8.2" parsed="|Gen|25|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.25.26">Gen. xxv. 26</scripRef>, xxxviii.
27&#8211;30</p></note> with the
hand put forth first as a sign of this very thing: so all the
saints who lived upon the earth previous to the birth of our Lord
Jesus Christ, although they were born antecedently, were
nevertheless united under the Head with that universal body of
which He is the Head.</p>

20.&#8212;Of Israel&#8217;s Bondage in Egypt, Their Deliverance, and Their
Passage Through the Red Sea.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xxi-p2">34. &#8220;That people, then, having
been brought down into Egypt, were in bondage to the harshest of
kings; and, taught by the most oppressive labors, they sought their
deliverer in God; and there was sent to them one belonging to the
people themselves, Moses, the holy servant of God, who, in the
might of God, terrified the impious nation of the Egyptians in
those days by great miracles, and led forth the people of God out
of that land through the Red Sea, where the water parted and opened
up a way for them as they crossed it, whereas, when the Egyptians
pressed on in pursuit, the waves returned to their channel and
overwhelmed them, so that they perished. Thus, then, just as the
earth through the agency of the flood was cleansed by the waters
from the wickedness of the sinners, who in those times were
destroyed in their inundation, while the righteous escaped by means
of the wood; so the people of God, when they went forth from Egypt,
found a way through the waters by which their enemies were
devoured. Nor was the sacrament of the wood wanting there. For
Moses smote with his rod, in order that that miracle might be
effected. Both these <pb n="305" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_305.html" id="iv.iii.xxi-Page_305"/>are signs of holy baptism, by
which the faithful pass into the new life, while their sins are
done away with like enemies, and perish. But more clearly was the
passion of Christ prefigured in the case of that people, when they
were commanded to slay and eat the lamb, and to mark their
door-posts with its blood, and to celebrate this rite every year,
and to designate it the Lord&#8217;s passover. For surely prophecy
speaks with the utmost plainness of the Lord Jesus Christ, when it
says that &#8220;He was led as a lamb to the slaughter.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1445" id="iv.iii.xxi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xxi-p3"> <scripRef passage="Isa. liii. 7" id="iv.iii.xxi-p3.2" parsed="|Isa|53|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.53.7">Isa. liii. 7</scripRef></p></note> And with
the sign of His passion and cross, thou art this day to be marked
on thy forehead, as on the door-post, and all Christians are marked
with the same.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xxi-p4">35. &#8220;Thereafter this people was
conducted through the wilderness for forty years. They also
received the law written by the finger of God, under which name the
Holy Spirit is signified, as it is declared with the utmost
plainness in the Gospel. For God is not defined<note place="end" n="1446" id="iv.iii.xxi-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xxi-p5"> Or = circumscribed, <i>
definitus</i>.</p></note> by the form of a body, neither are
members and fingers to be thought of as existent in Him in the way
in which we see them in ourselves. But, inasmuch as it is through
the Holy Spirit that God&#8217;s gifts are divided to His saints, in
order that, although they vary in their capacities, they may
nevertheless not lapse from the concord of charity, and inasmuch as
it is especially in the fingers that there appears a certain kind
of division, while nevertheless there is no separation from unity,
this may be the explanation of the phrase. But whether this may be
the case, or whatever other reason may be assigned for the Holy
Spirit being called the finger of God, we ought not at any rate to
think of the form of a human body when we hear this expression
used. The people in question, then, received the law written by the
finger of God, and that in good sooth on tables of stone, to
signify the hardness of their heart in that they were not to
fulfill the law. For, as they eagerly sought from the Lord gifts
meant for the uses of the body, they were held by carnal fear
rather than by spiritual charity. But nothing fulfills the law save
charity. Consequently, they were burdened with many visible
sacraments, to the intent that they should feel the pressure of the
yoke of bondage in the observances of meats, and in the sacrifices
of animals, and in other rites innumerable; which things, at the
same time, were signs of spiritual matters relating to the Lord
Jesus Christ and to the Church; which, furthermore, at that time
were both understood by a few holy men to the effect of yielding
the fruit of salvation, and observed by them in accordance with the
fitness of the time, while by the multitude of carnal men they were
observed only and not understood.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xxi-p6">36. &#8220;In this manner, then,
through many varied signs of things to come, which it would be
tedious to enumerate in complete detail, and which we now see in
their fulfillment in the Church, that people were brought to the
land of promise, in which they were to reign in a temporal and
carnal way in accordance with their own longings: which earthly
kingdom, nevertheless, sustained the image of a spiritual kingdom.

will hereafter judge, if even on to the end they find them wicked,
or with whom they will hereafter reign in equality, if they too
shall have been converted to the true God. Still all are enjoined
to be subject to the powers that are of man and of earth, even
until, at the end of the predetermined time which the seventy years
signify, the Church shall be delivered from the confusion of this
world, like as Jerusalem was to be set free from the captivity in
Babylonia. By occasion of that captivity, however, the kings of
earth too have themselves been led to forsake the idols on account
of which they were wont to persecute the Christians, and have come
to know, and now worship, the one true God and Christ the Lord; and
it is on their behalf that the Apostle Paul enjoins prayer to be
made, even although they should persecute the Church. For he speaks
in these terms: &#8216;I entreat, therefore, that first of all
supplications, adorations,<note place="end" n="1461" id="iv.iii.xxii-p12.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xxii-p13"> Instead of <i>orationes</i>; the

to the Church by these same persons, although it be but of a
temporal sort,&#8212;a temporal quiet for the work of building houses
after a spiritual fashion, and planting gardens and vineyards. For
witness your own case, too,&#8212;at this very time we are engaged, by
means of this discourse, in building you up and planting you. And
the like process is going on throughout the whole circle of lands,
in virtue of the peace allowed by Christian kings, even as the same
apostle thus expresses himself: &#8216;Ye are God&#8217;s husbandry; ye are
God&#8217;s building.&#8217;<note place="end" n="1463" id="iv.iii.xxii-p14.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xxii-p15"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. iii. 9" id="iv.iii.xxii-p15.2" parsed="|1Cor|3|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.9">1 Cor. iii. 9</scripRef>;

of the seventy years of which Jeremiah had mystically prophesied,
to the intent of prefiguring the end of times, with a view still to
the perfecting of that same figure, no settled peace and liberty
were conceded again to the Jews. Thus it was that they were
conquered subsequently by the Romans and made tributary. From that
period, in truth, at which they received the land of promise and
began to have kings, in order to preclude the supposition that the
promise of the Christ who was to be their Liberator had met its
complete fulfillment in the person of any one of their kings,
Christ was prophesied of with greater clearness in a number of
prophecies; not only by David himself in the book of Psalms, but
also by the rest of the great and holy prophets, even on to the
time of their conveyance into captivity in Babylonia; and in that
same captivity there were also prophets whose mission was to
prophesy of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ as the Liberator of
all. And after the restoration of the temple, when the seventy
years had passed, the Jews sus<pb n="307" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_307.html" id="iv.iii.xxii-Page_307"/>tained grievous oppressions and
sufferings at the hands of the kings of the Gentiles, fitted to
make them understand that the Liberator was not yet come, whom they
failed to apprehend as one who was to effect for them a spiritual
deliverance, and whom they fondly longed for on account of a carnal
liberation.</p>

the New Testament of our everlasting inheritance, wherein man was
to be renewed by the grace of God and lead a new life, that is, a
spiritual life; and with the view of exhibiting the first one as an
old dispensation, wherein a carnal people acting out the old man
(with the exception of a few patriarchs and prophets, who had
understanding, and some hidden saints), and leading a carnal life,
desiderated carnal rewards at the hands of the Lord God, and
received in that fashion but the figures of spiritual
blessings;&#8212;with this intent, I say, the Lord Christ, when made
man, despised all earthly good things, in order that He might show
us how these things ought to be despised; and He endured all
earthly ills which He was inculcating as things needful to be
endured; so that neither might our happiness be sought for in the
former class, nor our unhappiness be apprehended in the latter. For
being born of a mother who, although she conceived without being
touched by man and always remained thus untouched, in virginity
conceiving, in virginity bringing forth, in virginity dying, had
nevertheless been espoused to a handicraftsman, He extinguished all
the inflated pride of carnal nobility. Moreover, being born in the
city of Bethlehem, which among all the cities of Jud&#230;a was so
insignificant that even in our own day it is designated a village,
He willed not that any one should glory in the exalted position of
any city of earth. He, too, whose are all things and by whom all
things were created, was made poor, in order that no one, while
believing in Him, might venture to boast himself in earthly riches.
He refused to be made by men a king, because He displayed the
pathway of humility to those unhappy ones whom pride had separated
from Him;<note place="end" n="1471" id="iv.iii.xxiii-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xxiii-p11"> Reading <i>ab eo</i>; for which

gathered together in one place at Jerusalem itself, suddenly there
came a sound from heaven, as if a violent blast were being borne
onwards, and there appeared to them tongues cloven like fire, and
they began to speak with tongues, in such a manner that all those

country wheresoever they had been scattered abroad, and had learned
the diverse tongues of diverse nations); and thereafter, preaching
Christ with all boldness, they wrought many signs in His name,&#8212;so

so great signs to be wrought in the name of Him, whom, partly
through ill-will and partly in ignorance, they crucified, some of
them were provoked to persecute the apostles, who were His
preachers; while others, on the contrary, marvelling the more at
this very circumstance, that so great miracles were being performed
in the name of Him whom they had derided as one overborne and
conquered by themselves, repented, and were converted, so that
thousands of Jews believed on Him. For these parties were not bent
now on craving at the hand of God temporal benefits and an earthly
kingdom, neither did they look any more for Christ, the promised
king, in a carnal spirit; but they continued in immortal fashion to
apprehend and love Him, who in mortal fashion endured on their
behalf at their own hands sufferings so heavy, and imparted to them
the gift of forgiveness for all their sins, even down to the
iniquity of His own blood, and by the example of His own
resurrection unfolded immortality as the object which they should
hope for and long for at His hands. Accordingly, now mortifying the
earthly cravings of the old man, and inflamed with the new
experience of the spiritual life, as the Lord had enjoined in the
Gospel, they sold all that they had, and laid the price of their
possessions at the feet of the apostles, in order that these might
distribute to every man according as each had need; and living in
Christian love harmoniously with each other, they did not affirm
anything to be their own, but they had all things in common, and
were one in soul and heart toward God.<note place="end" n="1481" id="iv.iii.xxiv-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xxiv-p12"> <scripRef passage="Acts ii. 44" id="iv.iii.xxiv-p12.2" parsed="|Acts|2|44|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.2.44">Acts ii. 44</scripRef>, iv. 34</p></note> Afterwards these same persons also

the Jews, their carnal fellow-countrymen, and were dispersed
abroad, to the end that, in consequence of their dispersion, Christ
should be preached more extensively, and that they themselves at
the same time should be followers of the patience of their Lord.

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xxiv-p14">43. &#8220;Among those same persecutors
of the saints the Apostle Paul had once also ranked; and he raged
with eminent violence against the Christians. But, subsequently, he
became a believer and an apostle, and was sent to preach the gospel
to the Gentiles, suffering (in that ministry) things more grievous
on behalf of the name of Christ than were those which he had done
against the name of Christ. Moreover, in establishing churches
throughout all the nations where he was sowing the seed of the
gospel, he was wont to give earnest injunction that, as these
converts (coming as they did from the worship of idols and without
experience in the worship of the one God) could not readily serve
God in the way of selling and distributing their possessions, they
should make offerings for the poor brethren among the saints who
were in the churches of Judea which had believed in Christ. In this
manner the doctrine of the apostle constituted some to be, as it
were, soldiers, and others to be, as it were, provincial
tributaries, while it set Christ in the centre of them like the
corner-stone (in accordance with what had been announced beforetime
by the prophet),<note place="end" n="1483" id="iv.iii.xxiv-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xxiv-p15"> <scripRef passage="Ps. cxviii. 22" id="iv.iii.xxiv-p15.2" parsed="|Ps|118|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.118.22">Ps. cxviii. 22</scripRef>; <scripRef passage="Isa. xxviii. 16" id="iv.iii.xxiv-p15.3" parsed="|Isa|28|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.28.16">Isa.

advancing from different sides, that is to say, from Jews and from
Gentiles, might be joined together in the affection of kinship. But
at a later period heavier and more frequent persecutions arose from
the unbelieving Gentiles against the Church of Christ, and day by
day was fulfilled that prophetic word which the Lord spake when He
said, &#8216;Behold, I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves.&#8217;<note place="end" n="1484" id="iv.iii.xxiv-p15.4"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xxiv-p16"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 10.16" id="iv.iii.xxiv-p16.1" parsed="|Matt|10|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.16">Matt. x. 16</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xxv-p2">44. &#8220;But that vine, which was
spreading forth its fruitful shoots throughout the circle of lands,
according as had been prophesied with regard to it, and as had been
foretold by the Lord Himself, sprouted all the more luxuriantly in
proportion as it was watered with richer streams of the blood of
martyrs. And as these died in behalf of the truth of the faith in
countless numbers throughout all lands, even the persecuting
kingdoms themselves desisted, and were converted to the knowledge
and worship of Christ, with the neck of their pride broken.
Moreover it behoved that this same vine should be pruned in
accordance with the Lord&#8217;s repeated predictions,<note place="end" n="1485" id="iv.iii.xxv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xxv-p3"> <scripRef passage="John xv. 2" id="iv.iii.xxv-p3.2" parsed="|John|15|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.15.2">John xv. 2</scripRef></p></note> and that
the unfruitful twigs should be cut out of it, by which heresies and
schisms were occasioned in various localities, under the name of
Christ, on the part of men who sought not His glory but their own;
whose oppositions, however, also served more and more to discipline
the Church, and to test and illustrate both its doctrine and its
patience.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xxv-p4">45. &#8220;All these things, then, we
now perceive to be realized precisely as we read of them in
predictions uttered so long before the event. And as the first
Christians, inasmuch as they did not see these things literally
made good in their own day, were moved by miracles to believe them;
so as regards ourselves, inasmuch as all these things have now been
brought to pass exactly as we read of them in those books which
were written a long time previous to the fulfillment of the things
in question, wherein they were all announced as matters yet future,
even as they are now seen to be actually present, we are built up
unto faith, so that, enduring and persevering in the Lord, we
believe without any hesitation in the destined accomplishment even
of those things which still remain to be realized. For, indeed, in
the same Scriptures, tribulations yet to come are still read of, as
well as the final day of judgment itself, when all the citizens of
these two states shall receive their bodies again, and rise and
give account of their life before the judgment-seat of Christ. For
He will come in the glory of His power, who of old condescended to
come in the lowliness of humanity; and He will separate all the
godly from the ungodly,&#8212;not only from those who have utterly
refused to believe in Him at all, but also from those who have
believed in Him to no purpose and without fruit. To the one class
He will give an eternal kingdom together with Himself, while to the
other He will award eternal punishment together with the devil. But
as no joy yielded by things temporal can be found in any measure
comparable to the joy of life eternal which <pb n="310" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_310.html" id="iv.iii.xxv-Page_310"/>the saints
are destined to attain, so no torment of temporal punishments can
be compared to the everlasting torments of the
unrighteous.</p>

mother&#8217;s womb? Where, I repeat, was then this structure and this
stature of your body? Did it not come forth to light from the

difficulty, when He is so minded,&#8212;those of them at least, I
should say, that are judged by His justice to merit restoration; in
order that men may give account of their deeds in their very bodies
in which they have done them; and that in these they may be deemed
worthy to receive either the exchange of heavenly incorruption in

you against the temptations of the devil; and be careful, lest that
adversary come stealthily upon you from a strange quarter, who, as
a most malevolent solace for his own damnation, seeks others whose
companionship he may obtain in that damnation. For he is bold
enough not only to tempt Christian people through the
instrumentality of those who hate the Christian name, or are pained
to see the world taken possession of by that name, and still fondly
desire to do service to idols and to the curious rites of evil
spirits, but at times he also attempts the same through the agency
of such men as we have mentioned a little ago, to wit, persons
severed from the unity of the Church, like the twigs which are
lopped off when the vine is pruned, who are called heretics
or <pb n="311" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_311.html" id="iv.iii.xxvi-Page_311"/>schismatics. Howbeit sometimes also he makes the same
effort by means of the Jews, seeking to tempt and seduce believers
by their instrumentality. Nevertheless, what ought above all things
to be guarded against is, that no individual may suffer himself to
be tempted and deceived by men who are within the Catholic Church
itself, and who are borne by it like the chaff that is sustained
against the time of its winnowing. For in being patient toward such
persons, God has this end in view, namely, to exercise and confirm
the faith and prudence of His elect by means of the perverseness of
these others while at the same time He also takes account of the
fact that many of their number make an advance, and are converted

with even already? For you are not ignorant of the fact that many
who are called Christians engage in all these evil things which I
have briefly mentioned. Neither are you ignorant that at times,
perchance, men whom you know to bear the name of Christians are
guilty of even more grievous offenses than these. But if you have
come with the notion that you may do such things as in a secured
position, you are greatly in error; neither will the name of Christ
be of any avail to you when He begins to judge in utmost
strictness, who also of old condescended in utmost mercy to come to
man&#8217;s relief. For He Himself has foretold these things, and
speaks to this effect in the Gospel: &#8216;Not every one that saith
unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he
that doeth the will of my Father. Many shall say unto me in that
day, Lord, Lord, in thy name we have eaten and drunken.&#8217;<note place="end" n="1497" id="iv.iii.xxvi-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xxvi-p16"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 7.21,22" id="iv.iii.xxvi-p16.1" parsed="|Matt|7|21|7|22" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.21-Matt.7.22">Matt. vii. 21, 22</scripRef></p></note> For all,

are united with you in a liking for some charioteer, or some

pleasure in associating with those who are at one with you in
loving that God, with regard to whom no one that loves Him shall
ever have cause for the blush of shame, inasmuch as not only is He
Himself incapable of being overcome, but He will also render those
unconquerable who are affectionately disposed toward Him. At the
same time, not even on those same good men, who either anticipate
you or accompany you on the way to God, ought you to set your hope,
seeing that no more ought you to place it on yourself, however
great may be the progress you have made, but on Him who justifies
both them and you, and thus makes you what you are. For you are
secure in God, because He changes not; but in man no one prudently
counts himself secure. But if we ought to love those who are not
righteous as yet, with the view that they may be so, how much more
warmly ought those to be loved who already are righteous? At the
same time, it is one thing to love man, and another thing to set
one&#8217;s hope in man; and the difference is so great, that God
enjoins the one and forbids the other. Moreover, if you have

address the person is to be asked whether he believes these things
and earnestly desires to observe them. And on his replying to that
effect then certainly he is to be solemnly signed and dealt with in
accordance with the custom of the Church. On the subject of the
sacrament, indeed,<note place="end" n="1501" id="iv.iii.xxvii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xxvii-p3"> It has been supposed by the
Benedictine editors that <i>sane</i> may be a misreading for <i>

iii. p. 458, Bohn&#8217;s Translation) states that &#8220;in the North
African Church the bishop gave to those whom he received as <i>
competentes</i>, while signing the cross over them as a symbol of
consecration, a portion of salt over which a blessing had been
pronounced. This was to signify the divine word imparted to the
candidates as the true salt for human nature.&#8221; There is an
allusion to the same in the <i>Confessions</i> (i. 11), where
Augustin says, &#8220;Even from my mother&#8217;s womb who greatly hoped in
thee, I was signed with the sign of His cross, and seasoned with
His salt.&#8221;</p></note> which he receives, it is first to
be well impressed upon his notice that the signs of divine things
are, it is true, things visible, but that the invisible things
themselves are also honored in them, and that that species,<note place="end" n="1502" id="iv.iii.xxvii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xxvii-p4"> <i>Speciem</i> = kind, in reference to the outward and sensible sign of

then sanctified by the blessing, is therefore not to be regarded
merely in the way in which it is regarded in any common use. And

(spiritual grace) of which this material substance presents the
emblem. Next we should take occasion by that ceremony to admonish
him that, if he hears anything even in the Scriptures which may
carry a carnal sound, he should, even although he fails to
understand it, nevertheless believe that something spiritual is
signified thereby, which bears upon holiness of character and the
future life. Moreover, in this way he learns briefly that, whatever
he may hear in the canonical books of such a kind as to make him
unable to refer it to the love of eternity, and of truth, and of
sanctity, and to the love of our neighbor, he should believe that
to have been spoken or done with a figurative significance; and
that, consequently, he should endeavor to understand it in such a
manner as to refer it to that twofold (duty of) love. He should be
further admonished, however, not to take the term <i>neighbor</i>
in a carnal sense, but to understand under it every one who may
ever be with him in that holy city, whether there already or not
yet apparent. And (he should finally be counselled) not to despair
of the amendment of any man whom he perceives to be living under
the patience of God for no other reason, as the apostle<note place="end" n="1504" id="iv.iii.xxvii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xxvii-p6"> <scripRef passage="Rom. 2.4" id="iv.iii.xxvii-p6.1" parsed="|Rom|2|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.2.4">Rom. ii . 4</scripRef></p></note> says, than

have supposed myself to have been teaching some uninstructed person
in my presence, appears to you to be too long, you are at liberty
to expound these matters with greater brevity. I do not think,
however, that it ought to be longer than this. At the same time,
much depends on what the case itself, as it goes on, may render
advisable, and what the audience actually present shows itself not
only to bear, but also to desire. When, however, rapid despatch is
required, notice with what facility the whole matter admits of
being explained. Suppose once more that some one comes before us
who desires to be a Christian; and accordingly, suppose further
that he has been interrogated, and that he has returned the answer
which we have taken the former catechumen to have given; for, even
should he decline to make this reply, it must at least be said that
he ought to have given it;&#8212;then all that remains to be said to
him should be put together in the following manner:&#8212;</p>

great and true blessedness which is promised to the saints in a
future world. All visible things, on the other hand, pass away, and

(even now) they drag those who love them along with them onward to
destruction. The merciful God, willing to deliver men from this
destruction, that is to say, from everlasting pains, if they should
not prove enemies to themselves, and if they should not withstand
the mercy of their Creator, sent His only-begotten Son, that is to
say, His Word, equal with Himself, by whom He made all things. And
He, while abiding indeed in His divinity, and neither receding from
the Father nor being changed in anything, did at the same time, by
taking on Himself human nature,<note place="end" n="1506" id="iv.iii.xxvii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xxvii-p10"> <i>Hominem</i></p></note> and appearing to men in mortal

that is to say, Adam, because he consented unto his wife when she
was seduced by the devil to the effect that they (both)

Christ, who is also God, the Son of God, all those who believe in
Him might have all their past sins done away with, and enter into

<span class="c2" id="iv.iii.xxviii-p1.1">Chapter 27.&#8212;Of
the Prophecies of the Old Testament in Their Visible Fulfillment in
the Church.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xxviii-p2">53. &#8220;For all those things, which
at present you witness in the Church of God, and which you see to
be taking place under the name of Christ throughout the whole
world, were predicted long ages ago. And even as we read of them,
so also we now see them. And by means of these things we are built
up unto faith. Once of old there occurred a flood over the whole
earth, the object of which was that sinners might be destroyed.
And, nevertheless, those who escaped in the ark exhibited a
sacramental sign of the Church that was to be, which at present is
floating on the waves of the world, and is delivered from
submersion by the wood of the cross of Christ. It was predicted to
Abraham, a faithful servant of God, a single man, that of Him it
was determined that a people should be born who should worship one
God in the midst of all other nations which worshipped idols; and
all things which were prophesied of as destined to happen to that
people have come to pass exactly as they were foretold. Among that
people Christ, the King of all saints and their God, was also
prophesied of as destined to come of the seed of that same Abraham
according to the flesh, which (flesh) He took unto Himself, in
order that all those also who became followers of His faith might
be sons of Abraham; and thus it has come to pass: Christ was born
of the Virgin Mary, who belonged to that race. It was foretold by
the prophets that He would suffer on the cross at the hands of that
same people of the Jews, of whose lineage, according to the flesh,
He came; and thus it has come to pass. It was foretold that He
would rise again: He has risen again; and, in accordance with these
same predictions of the prophets, He has ascended into heaven and
has sent the Holy Spirit to His disciples. It was foretold not only
by the prophets, but also by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, that
His Church would exist throughout the whole world, extended by the
martyrdoms and sufferings of the saints; and this was foretold at a
time when as yet His name was at once undeclared to the Gentiles,
and made a subject of derision where it was known; and,
nevertheless, in the power of His miracles, whether those which He
wrought by His own hand or those which he effected by means of His
servants, as these things are being reported and believed, we
already see the fulfillment of that which was predicted, and behold
the very kings of the earth, who formerly were wont to persecute
the Christians, even now brought into subjection to the name of
Christ. It was also foretold that schisms and heresies would arise
from His Church, and that under His name they would seek their own
glory instead of Christ&#8217;s, in such places as they might be able
to command; and these predictions have been realized.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iii.xxviii-p3">54. &#8220;Will those things, then,
which yet remain fail to come to pass? It is manifest that, just as
the former class of things which were foretold have come to pass,
so will these latter also come to pass. I refer to all the
tribulations of the righteous, which yet wait for fulfillment, and
to the day of judgment, which will separate all the wicked from the
righteous in the resurrection of the dead;&#8212;and not only will it
thus separate those wicked men who are outside the Church, but also
it will set apart for the fire, which is due to such, the chaff of
the Church itself, which must be borne with in utmost patience on
to the last winnowing. Moreover, they who deride the (doctrine of
a) resurrection, because they think that this flesh, inasmuch as it
becomes corrupt, cannot rise again, will certainly rise in the same
unto punishment, and God will make it plain to such, that He who
was able to form these bodies when as yet they were not, is able in
a moment to restore them as they were. But all the faithful who are
destined to reign with Christ shall rise with the same body in such
wise that they may also be counted worthy to be changed into
angelic incorruption; so that they may be made equal unto the
angels of God, even as the Lord Himself has promised;<note place="end" n="1507" id="iv.iii.xxviii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xxviii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Luke xx. 36" id="iv.iii.xxviii-p4.2" parsed="|Luke|20|36|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.20.36">Luke xx. 36</scripRef></p></note> and that

as of kindred nature; and further, with a love conformable to these
things not as they are in men, but as they are in the very fountain
of incorruptible and unchangeable wisdom. Whomsoever, therefore,
you may observe to be loving these things, attach yourself to them,
so that through Christ, who became man in order that He might be
the Mediator between God and men, you may be reconciled to God. But
as regards the perverse, even if they find their way within the
walls of the Church, think not that they will find their way into
the kingdom of heaven; for in their own time they will be set
apart, if they have not altered to the better. Consequently, follow
the example of good men, bear with the wicked, love all; forasmuch
as you know not what he will be to-morrow who to-day is evil.
Howbeit, love not the unrighteousness of such; but love the persons
themselves with the express intent that they may apprehend
righteousness; for not only is the love of God enjoined upon us,
but also the love of our neighbor, on which two commandments hang

equal with the Father and with the Son; for this same Trinity is
God; and on this God every hope ought to be placed. On man our hope
ought not to be placed, of whatsoever character he may be. For He,
by whom we are justified, is one thing; and they, together with
whom we are justified, are another. Moreover, it is not only by
lusts that the devil tempts, but also by the terrors of insults,
and pains, and death itself. But whatever a man shall have suffered
on behalf of the name of Christ, and for the sake of the hope of
eternal life, and shall have endured in constancy, (in accordance
therewith) the greater reward shall be given him; whereas, if he
shall give way to the devil, he shall be damned along with him. But
works of mercy, conjoined with pious humility, meet with this
acknowledgment from God, to wit, that He will not suffer His
servants to be tempted more than they are able to bear.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1514" id="iv.iii.xxviii-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iii.xxviii-p12"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 13" id="iv.iii.xxviii-p12.2" parsed="|1Cor|10|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.13">1 Cor. x. 13</scripRef></p></note></p>

occasion and date of the composition of this treatise are indicated
in a statement which Augustin makes in the seventeenth chapter of
the First Book of his <i>Retractations</i>.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv.i-p3">From this we learn that, in its
original form, it was a discourse which Augustin, when only a
presbyter, was requested to deliver in public by the bishops
assembled at the Council of Hippo-Regius, and that it was
subsequently issued as a book at the desire of friends. The general
assembly of the North African Church, which was thus convened at
what is now Bona, in the modern territory of Algiers, took place in
the year 393 <span class="c19" id="iv.iv.i-p3.1">A.D.</span>, and was otherwise one
of some historical importance, on account of the determined protest
which it emitted against the position elsewhere allowed to
Patriarchs in the Church, and against the admittance of any more
authoritative or magisterial title to the highest ecclesiastical
official than that of simply &#8220;Bishop of the first Church&#8221;
(<i>prim&#230; sedis episcopus</i>).</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv.i-p4">The work constitutes an exposition
of the several clauses of the so-called Apostles&#8217; Creed. The
questions concerning the mutual relations of the three Persons in
the Godhead are handled with greatest fullness; in connection with
which, especially in the use made of the analogies of Being,
Knowledge, and Love, and in the cautions thrown in against certain
applications of these and other illustrations taken from things of
human experience, we come across sentiments which are also repeated
in the <i>City of God</i>, the books on the <i>Trinity</i>, and
others of his doctrinal writings.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv.i-p5">The passage referred to in the <i>
Retractations</i> is as follows: About the same period, in presence
of the bishops, who gave me orders to that effect, and who were
holding a plenary Council of the whole of Africa at Hippo-Regius, I
delivered, as presbyter, a discussion on the subject of <i>Faith
and the Creed</i>. This disputation, at the very pressing request
of some of those who were on terms of more than usual intimacy and
affection with us, I threw into the form of a book, in which the
themes themselves are made the subjects of discourse, although not
in a method involving the adoption of the particular connection of
words which is given to the <i>competentes</i><note place="end" n="1515" id="iv.iv.i-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.i-p6"> <i>i.e.</i>the third order of catechumens, embracing those
thoroughly prepared for baptism.</p></note> to be committed to memory. In this
book, when discussing the question of the resurrection of the
flesh, I say:<note place="end" n="1516" id="iv.iv.i-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.i-p7"> Chap. x. &#167; 24.</p></note> &#8216;Rise
again the body will, according to the Christian faith, which is
incapable of deceiving. And if this appears incredible to any one,
[it is because] he looks simply to what the flesh is at present,
while he fails to consider of what nature it shall be hereafter.
For at that time of angelic change it will no more be flesh and
blood, but only body;&#8217; and so on, through the other statements
which I have made there on the subject of the change of bodies
terrestrial into bodies celestial, as the apostle, when he spake
from the same point, said, &#8216;Flesh and blood shall not inherit the
kingdom of God.&#8217;<note place="end" n="1517" id="iv.iv.i-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.i-p8"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xv. 50" id="iv.iv.i-p8.2" parsed="|1Cor|15|50|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.50">1 Cor. xv. 50</scripRef></p></note> But if any one takes these
declarations in a sense leading him to suppose that the earthly
body, such as we now have it, is changed in the resurrection into a
celestial body, in any such wise as that neither these members nor
the substance of the flesh will subsist any <pb n="318" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_318.html" id="iv.iv.i-Page_318"/>more,
undoubtedly he must be set right, by being put in mind of the body
of the Lord, who subsequently to His resurrection appeared in the
same members, as One who was not only to be seen with the eyes, but
also handled with the hands; and made His possession of the flesh
likewise surer by the discourse which He spake, saying, &#8216;Handle
me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me
have.&#8217;<note place="end" n="1518" id="iv.iv.i-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.i-p9"> <scripRef passage="Luke xxiv. 39" id="iv.iv.i-p9.2" parsed="|Luke|24|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.24.39">Luke xxiv. 39</scripRef></p></note> Hence it
is certain that the apostle did not deny that the substance of the
flesh will exist in the kingdom of God, but that under the name of
&#8216;flesh and blood&#8217; he designated either men who live after the
flesh, or the express corruption of the flesh, which assuredly at
that period shall subsist no more. For after he had said, &#8216;Flesh
and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God,&#8217; what he proceeds
to say next,&#8212;namely, &#8216;neither shall corruption inherit
incorruption,&#8217;&#8212;is rightly taken to have been added by way of
explaining his previous statement. And on this subject, which is
one on which it is difficult to convince unbelievers, any one who
reads my last book, <i>On the City of God</i>, will find that I
have discoursed with the utmost carefulness of which I am
capable.<note place="end" n="1519" id="iv.iv.i-p9.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.i-p10"> <i>City of God</i>, Bk. xxii. Ch. 21.</p></note> The

becomes us to be mindful both of righteousness and of salvation.
For, destined as we are to reign hereafter in everlasting
righteousness, we certainly cannot secure our salvation from the

salvation of our neighbors, we likewise with the mouth make our own
profession of the faith which we carry in our heart. And it must be
our aim, by pious and careful watchfulness, to provide against the
possibility of the said faith sustaining any injury in us, on any

heretics.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv.ii-p6">We have, however, the catholic
faith in the Creed, known to the faithful and committed to memory,
contained in a form of expression as concise as has been rendered
admissible by the circumstances of the case; the purpose of which
[compilation] was, that individuals who are but beginners and
sucklings among those who have been born again in Christ, and who
have not yet been strengthened by most diligent and spiritual
handling and understanding of the divine Scriptures, should be
furnished with a summary, expressed in few words, of those matters
of necessary belief which were subsequently to be explained to them
in many words, as they made progress and rose to [the height of]
divine doctrine, on the assured and steadfast basis of humility and
charity. It is underneath these few words, therefore, which are
thus set in order in the Creed, that most heretics have endeavored
to conceal their poisons; whom divine mercy has withstood, and
still withstands, by the instrumentality of spiritual men, who have
been counted worthy not only to accept and believe the catholic
faith as expounded in those terms, but also thoroughly to
understand and apprehend it by the enlightenment imparted by the
Lord. For it is written, &#8220;Unless ye believe, ye shall not

handling of the faith is of service for the protection of the
Creed; not, however, to the intent that this should itself be given
instead of the Creed, to be committed to memory and repeated by
those who are receiving the grace of God, but that it may guard the
matters which are retained in the Creed against the insidious
assaults of the heretics, by means of catholic authority and a more

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv.iii-p2">2. For certain parties have
attempted to gain acceptance for the opinion that <span class="c19" id="iv.iv.iii-p2.1">God the Father</span> is not <span class="c19" id="iv.iv.iii-p2.2">
Almighty</span>: not that they have been bold enough expressly to
affirm this, but in their traditions they are convicted of
entertaining and crediting such a notion. For when they affirm that
there is a nature<note place="end" n="1523" id="iv.iv.iii-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.iii-p3"> <i>Naturam</i></p></note> which God Almighty did not create,
but of which at the same time He fashioned this world, which they
admit to have been disposed in beauty,<note place="end" n="1524" id="iv.iv.iii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.iii-p4"> Reading <i>pulchre ordinatum</i>.
Some editions give <i>pulchre ornatum</i> = beautifully
adorned.</p></note> they thereby deny that God is
almighty, to the effect of not believing that He could have created
the world without employing, for the purpose of its construction,
another nature, which had been in existence previously, and which
He Himself had not made. Thus, forsooth, [they reason] from their
carnal familiarity with the sight of craftsmen and house-builders,
and artisans of all descriptions, who have no power to make good
the effect of their own art unless they get the help of materials
already prepared. And so these parties in like manner understand
the Maker of the world not to be almighty, if<note place="end" n="1525" id="iv.iv.iii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.iii-p5"> <i>Si mundum fabricare non
posset</i>. For <i>si</i> some <span class="c19" id="iv.iv.iii-p5.1">mss.</span> give <i>qui</i> = inasmuch as He could not,
etc.</p></note> thus He could not fashion the said
world without the help of some other nature, not framed by Himself,
which He had to use as His materials. Or if indeed they do allow
God, the Maker of the world, to be almighty, it becomes matter of
course that they must also acknowledge that He made out of nothing
the things which He did make. For, granting that He is almighty,
there cannot exist anything of which He should not be the Creator.
For although He made something out of something, as man out of
clay,<note place="end" n="1526" id="iv.iv.iii-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.iii-p6"> <i>De limo</i> = of mud.</p></note>
nevertheless He certainly did not make any object out of aught
which He Himself had not made; for the earth from which the clay
comes He had made out of nothing. And even if He had made out of
some material the heavens and the earth themselves, that is to say,
the universe and all things which are in it, according as it is
written, &#8220;Thou who didst make the world out of matter
unseen,&#8221;<note place="end" n="1527" id="iv.iv.iii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.iii-p7"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. xi. 17" id="iv.iv.iii-p7.2" parsed="|Wis|11|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.11.17">Wisd. xi. 17</scripRef></p></note> or also
&#8220;without form,&#8221; as some copies give it; yet we are under no
manner of necessity to believe that this very material of which the
universe was made, although it might be &#8220;without form,&#8221;
although it might be &#8220;unseen,&#8221; whatever might be the mode of
its subsistence, could possibly have subsisted of itself, as if it
were co-eternal and co-eval with God. But whatsoever that mode was
which it possessed to the effect of subsisting in some manner,
whatever that manner might be, and of being capable of taking on
the forms of distinct things, this it did not possess except by the
hand of Almighty God, by whose goodness it is that everything
exists,&#8212;not only every object which is already formed, but also
every object which is formable. This, moreover, is the difference
between the formed and the formable, that the formed has already
taken on form, while the formable is capable of taking the same.
But the same Being who imparts form to objects, also imparts the
capability of being formed. For of Him and in Him is the fairest
figure<note place="end" n="1528" id="iv.iv.iii-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.iii-p8"> <i>Speciosissima
species</i> = the seemliest
semblance.</p></note> of all
things, unchangeable; and therefore He Himself is One, who
communicates to everything its possibilities, not only that it be
beautiful actually, but also that it be capable of being beautiful.
For which reason we do most right to believe that God made all
things of nothing. For, even although the world was made of some
sort of material, this self-same material itself was made of
nothing; so that, in accordance with the most orderly gift of God,
there was to enter first the capacity of taking forms, and then
that all things should be formed which have been formed. This,
however, we have said, in order that no one might suppose that the
utterances of the divine Scriptures are contrary the one to the
other, in so far as it is written at once that God made all things
of nothing, and that the world was made of matter without
form.</p>

apprehend merely in the sense in which we think of our own words,
which are given forth by the voice and the mouth, and strike the
air and pass on, and subsist no longer than their sound continues.
For that Word remains unchangeably: for of this very Word was it
spoken when of Wisdom it was said, &#8220;Remaining in herself, she
maketh all things new.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1533" id="iv.iv.iv-p2.8"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.iv-p3"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. vii. 27" id="iv.iv.iv-p3.2" parsed="|Wis|7|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.7.27">Wisd. vii. 27</scripRef></p></note> Moreover, the reason of His being
named the Word of the Father, is that the Father is made known by
Him. Accordingly, just as it is our intention, when we speak truth,
that by means of our words our mind should be made known to him who
hears us, and that whatever we carry in secrecy in our heart may be
set forth by means of signs of this sort for the intelligent
understanding of another individual; so this Wisdom that God the
Father begot is most appropriately named His Word, inasmuch as the
most hidden Father is made known to worthy minds by the same.<note place="end" n="1534" id="iv.iv.iv-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.iv-p4"> Adopting the Benedictine version

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv.iv-p5">4. Now there is a very great
difference between our mind and those words of ours, by which we
endeavor to set forth the said mind. We indeed do not beget
intelligible words,<note place="end" n="1535" id="iv.iv.iv-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.iv-p6"> <i>Sonantia verba</i>
= sounding, vocal words.</p></note> but we form them; and in the
forming of them the body is the underlying material. Between mind
and body, however, there is the greatest difference. But God, when
He begot the Word, begot that which He is Himself. Neither out of
nothing, nor of any material already made and founded did He then
beget; but He begot of Himself that which He is Himself. For we too
aim at this when we speak, (as we shall see) if we carefully
consider the inclination<note place="end" n="1536" id="iv.iv.iv-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.iv-p7"> <i>Appetitum</i></p></note> of our will; not when we lie, but
when we speak the truth. For to what else do we direct our efforts
then, but to bring our own very mind, if it can be done at all, in
upon the mind of the hearer, with the view of its being apprehended
and thoroughly discerned by him; so that we may indeed abide in our
very selves, and make no retreat from ourselves, and yet at the
same time put forth a sign of such a nature as that by it a
knowledge of us<note place="end" n="1537" id="iv.iv.iv-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.iv-p8"> <i>Nostra notitia</i>

effected in another individual; that thus, so far as the faculty is

Lord, which He deemed it worthy of Him to bear for us and to
minister in behalf of our salvation. For in so far as He is the
only-begotten Son of God, it cannot be said of Him that <i>He
was</i> and that <i>He shall</i> be, but only that <i>He is</i>;
because, on the one hand, that which <i>was,</i> <i>now is</i> not;
and, on the other, that which <i>shall be, as yet is</i> not. He,
then, is unchangeable, independent of the condition of times and
variation. And it is my opinion that this is the very consideration
to which was due the circumstance that He introduced to the
apprehension of His servant Moses the kind of name [which He then
adopted]. For when he asked of Him by whom he should say that he
was sent, in the event of the people to whom he was being sent
despising him, he received his answer when He spake in this wise:
&#8220;<span class="c19" id="iv.iv.v-p21.2">I Am that I Am</span>.&#8221; Thereafter, too, He
added this: &#8220;Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel,
<span class="c19" id="iv.iv.v-p21.3">He that is</span> (<i>Qui est</i>) has sent me
unto you.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1559" id="iv.iv.v-p21.4"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.v-p22"> <scripRef passage="Ex. iii. 14" id="iv.iv.v-p22.2" parsed="|Exod|3|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.3.14">Ex. iii. 14</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv.v-p23">7. From this, I trust, it is now
made patent to spiritual minds that there cannot possibly exist any
nature contrary to God. For if He <i>is</i>,&#8212;and this is a word
which can be spoken with propriety only of God (for that which
truly <i>is</i> remains unchangeably; inasmuch as that which is
changed has been something which now it is not, and shall be
something which as yet it is not),&#8212;it follows that God has
nothing contrary to Himself. For if the question were put to us,
What is contrary to white? we would reply, black; if the question
were, What is contrary to hot? we would reply, cold; if the
question were, What is contrary to quick? we would reply, slow;
and <pb n="325" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_325.html" id="iv.iv.v-Page_325"/>all similar interrogations we would answer in like
manner. When, however, it is asked, What is contrary to that <i>
which is</i>? the right reply to give is, <i>that which is
not</i>.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv.v-p24">8. But whereas, in a temporal
dispensation, as I have said, with a view to our salvation and
restoration, and with the goodness of God acting therein, our
changeable nature has been assumed by that unchangeable Wisdom of
God, we add the faith in temporal things which have been done with
salutary effect on our behalf, believing in that <span class="c19" id="iv.iv.v-p24.1">
Son of God Who Was Born Through the Holy Ghost of the Virgin
Mary.</span> For by the gift of God, that is, by the Holy Spirit,
there was granted to us so great humility on the part of so great a
God, that He deemed it worthy of Him to assume the entire nature of
man (<i>totum hominem</i>) in the womb of the Virgin, inhabiting
the material body so that it sustained no detriment
(<i>integrum</i>), and leaving it<note place="end" n="1560" id="iv.iv.v-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.v-p25"> <i>Deserens</i>. With less point, <i>deferens</i> has been suggested =
bearing it, or delivering it.</p></note> without detriment. This temporal
dispensation is in many ways craftily assailed by the heretics. But
if any one shall have grasped the catholic faith, so as to believe
that the entire nature of man was assumed by the Word of God, that
is to say, body, soul, and spirit, he has sufficient defense
against those parties. For surely, since that assumption was
effected in behalf of our salvation, one must be on his guard lest,
as he believes that there is something belonging to our nature
which sustains no relation to that assumption, this something may
fail also to sustain any relation to the salvation.<note place="end" n="1561" id="iv.iv.v-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.v-p26"> Or it may = <i>he</i> should fail
to have any relation to the salvation.</p></note> And seeing
that, with the exception of the form of the members, which has been
imparted to the varieties of living objects with differences
adapted to their different kinds, man is in nothing separated from
the cattle but in [the possession of] a rational spirit
(<i>rationali spiritu</i>), which is also named mind (<i>mens</i>),
how is that faith sound, according to which the belief is
maintained, that the Wisdom of God assumed that part of us which we
hold in common with the cattle, while He did not assume that which
is brightly illumined by the light of wisdom, and which is man&#8217;s
peculiar gift?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv.v-p27">9. Moreover, those parties<note place="end" n="1562" id="iv.iv.v-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.v-p28"> Referring to the
Manicheans.</p></note> also are
to be abhorred who deny that our Lord Jesus Christ had in Mary a
mother upon earth; while that dispensation has honored both sexes,
at once the male and the female, and has made it plain that not
only that sex which He assumed pertains to God&#8217;s care, but also
that sex by which He did assume this other, in that He bore [the
nature of] the man (<i>virum gerendo</i>), [and] in that He was
born of the woman. Neither is there anything to compel us to a
denial of the mother of the Lord, in the circumstance that this
word was spoken by Him: &#8220;Woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine
hour is not yet come.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1563" id="iv.iv.v-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.v-p29"> <scripRef passage="John ii. 4" id="iv.iv.v-p29.2" parsed="|John|2|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.2.4">John ii. 4</scripRef></p></note> But He rather admonishesus to
understand that, in respect of His being God, there was no mother
for Him, the part of whose personal majesty (<i>cujus majestatis

water into wine. But as regards His being crucified, He was
crucified in respect of his being man; and that was the hour which
had not come as yet, at the time when this word was spoken, &#8220;What
have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come;&#8221; that is, the
hour at which I shall recognize thee. For at that period, when He
was crucified as man, He recognized His human mother (<i>hominem
matrem</i>), and committed her most humanely (<i>humanissime</i>)
to the care of the best beloved disciple.<note place="end" n="1564" id="iv.iv.v-p29.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.v-p30"> <scripRef passage="John xix. 26, 27" id="iv.iv.v-p30.2" parsed="|John|19|26|19|27" osisRef="Bible:John.19.26-John.19.27">John xix. 26, 27</scripRef></p></note> Nor, again, should we be moved by

when parents hinder our ministry wherein we minister the word of
God to our brethren, they ought not to be recognized by us. For if,
on the ground of His having said, &#8220;Who is my mother?&#8221; every one
should conclude that He had no mother on earth, then each should as
matter of course be also compelled to deny that the apostles had
fathers on earth; since He gave them an injunction in these terms:

never become debased by any defilement thence contracted, albeit
that the visible light is by nature in closer conjunction with
visible pollutions. How much less, therefore, could the Word of

the female body, wherein He assumed human flesh together with soul

is manifest that the Word of God could in no way have been defiled

Consequently, although, when we are interrogated on the subject of
each [of these Persons] severally, we reply that that particular
one regarding whom the question is asked, whether it be the Father,
or the Son, or the Holy Spirit, is God, no one, notwithstanding
this, should suppose that three Gods are worshipped by
us.</p><pb n="328" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_328.html" id="iv.iv.x-Page_328"/>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv.x-p8">17. Neither is it strange that these things are said in
reference to an ineffable Nature, when even in those objects which
we discern with the bodily eyes, and judge of by the bodily sense,
something similar holds good. For take the instance of an
interrogation on the subject of a fountain, and consider how we are
unable then to affirm that the said fountain is itself the river;
and how, when we are asked about the river, we are as little able
to call it the fountain; and, again, how we are equally unable to
designate the draught, which comes of the fountain or the river,
either river or fountain. Nevertheless, in the case of this trinity
we use the name <i>water</i> [for the whole]; and when the question
is put regarding each of these separately, we reply in each several
instance that the thing is <i>water</i>. For if I inquire whether
it is water in the fountain, the reply is given that it is water;
and if we ask whether it is water in the river, no different
response is returned; and in the case of the said draught, no other
answer can possibly be made: and yet, for all this, we do not speak
of these things as three waters, but as one water. At the same
time, of course, care must be taken that no one should conceive of
the ineffable substance of that Majesty merely as he might think of
this visible and material<note place="end" n="1594" id="iv.iv.x-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.x-p9"> <i>Corporeum</i> = corporeal.</p></note> fountain, or river, or draught.
For in the case of these latter that water which is at present in
the fountain goes forth into the river, and does not abide in
itself; and when it passes from the river or from the fountain into
the draught, it does not continue permanently there where it is
taken from. Therefore it is possible here that the same water may
be in view at one time under the appellation of the fountain and at
another under that of the river, and at a third under that of the
draught. But in the case of that Trinity, we have affirmed it to be
impossible that the Father should be sometime the Son, and sometime
the Holy Spirit: just as, in a tree, the root is nothing else than
the root, and the trunk (<i>robur</i>) is nothing else than the
trunk, and we cannot call the branches anything else than branches;
for, what is called the root cannot be called trunk and branches;
and the wood which belongs to the root cannot by any sort of
transference be now in the root, and again in the trunk, and yet
again in the branches, but only in the root; since this rule of
designation stands fast, so that the root is wood, and the trunk is
wood, and the branches are wood, while nevertheless it is not three
woods that are thus spoken of, but only one. Or, if these objects
have some sort of dissimilarity, so that on account of their
difference in strength they may be spoken of, without any
absurdity, as three woods; at least all parties admit the force of
the former example,&#8212;namely, that if three cups be filled out of
one fountain, they may certainly be called three cups, but cannot
be spoken of as three waters, but only as one all together. Yet, at
the same time, when asked concerning the several cups, one by one,
we may answer that in each of them by itself there is water;
although in this case no such transference takes place as we were
speaking of as occurring from the fountain into the river. But
these examples in things material (<i>corporalia exempla</i>) have
been adduced not in virtue of their likeness to that divine Nature,
but in reference to the oneness which subsists even in things
visible, so that it may be understood to be quite a possibility for
three objects of some sort, not only severally, but also all
together, to obtain one single name; and that in this way no one
may wonder and think it absurd that we should call the Father God,
the Son God, the Holy Spirit God, and that nevertheless we should
say that there are not three Gods in that Trinity, but one God and
one substance.<note place="end" n="1595" id="iv.iv.x-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.x-p10"> Many <span class="c19" id="iv.iv.x-p10.1">

passages of a similar order. But these statements have had a place
given them, partly with a view to that administration of His
assumption of human nature (<i>administrationem suscepti
hominis</i>), in accordance with which it is said that &#8220;He
emptied Himself:&#8221; not that that Wisdom was changed, since it is
absolutely unchangeable; but that it was His will to make Himself
known in such humble fashion to men. Partly then, I repeat, it is
with a view to this administration that those things have been thus
written which the heretics make the ground of their false
allegations; and partly it was with a view to the consideration
that the Son owes to the Father that which He <i>is</i>,<note place="end" n="1610" id="iv.iv.x-p25.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.x-p26"> Or it may be = that the Son owes

also certainly owing this in particular to the Father, to wit, that
He is equal to the same Father, or that He is His Peer (<i>eidem
Patri &#230;qualis aut par est</i>), whereas the Father owes whatsoever
He is to no one.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv.x-p27">19. With respect to the <span class="c19" id="iv.iv.x-p27.1">Holy Spirit</span>, however, there has not been as yet,
on the part of learned and distinguished investigators of the
Scriptures, a discussion of the subject full enough or careful
enough to make it possible for us to obtain an intelligent
conception of what also constitutes His special individuality
(<i>proprium</i>): in virtue of which special individuality it
comes to be the case that we cannot call Him either the Son or the
Father, but only the Holy Spirit; excepting that they predicate Him
to be the Gift of God, so that we may believe God not to give a
gift inferior to Himself. At the same time they hold by this
position, namely, to predicate the Holy Spirit neither as begotten,
like the Son, of the Father; for Christ is the only one [so
begotten]: nor as [begotten] of the Son, like a Grandson of the
Supreme Father: while they do not affirm Him to owe that which He
is to no one, but [admit Him to owe it] to the Father, of whom are
all things; lest we should establish two Beginnings without
beginning (<i>ne duo constituamus principia isne principio</i>),
which would be an assertion at once most false and most absurd, and
one proper not to the catholic faith, but to the error of certain
heretics.<note place="end" n="1611" id="iv.iv.x-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.x-p28"> In reference, again, to Manichean
errorists.</p></note> Some,
however, have gone so far as to believe that the communion of the
Father and the Son, and (so to speak) their Godhead
(<i>deitatem</i>), which the Greeks designate <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.iv.x-p28.1">&#952;&#949;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span>, is the
Holy Spirit; so that, inasmuch as the Father is God and the Son
God, the Godhead itself, in which they are united with each
other,&#8212;to wit, the former by begetting the Son, and the latter by
cleaving to the Father,<note place="end" n="1612" id="iv.iv.x-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.x-p29"> <i>Patri coh&#339;rendo</i>

equal with Him by whom He is begotten. This Godhead, then, which
they wish to be understood likewise as the love and charity
subsisting between these two [Persons], the one toward the other,
they affirm to have received the name of the Holy Spirit. And this
opinion of theirs they support by many proofs drawn from the
Scriptures; among which we might instance either the passage which
says, &#8220;For the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
Holy Ghost, who has been given unto us,&#8221;<note place="end" n="1613" id="iv.iv.x-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.x-p30"> <scripRef passage="Rom. v. 5" id="iv.iv.x-p30.2" parsed="|Rom|5|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.5.5">Rom. v. 5</scripRef></p></note> or many other proofs texts of a
similar tenor: while they ground their position also upon the

one enjoys that which he knows, unless he also love it. To enjoy
the Wisdom of God, however, implies nothing else than to cleave to
the same in love (<i>ei dilectione coh&#230;rere</i>). Neither does any
one abide in that which he apprehends, but by love; and accordingly
the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of sanctity (<i>Spiritus
Sanctus</i>), inasmuch as all things that are sanctioned
(<i>sanciuntur</i>)<note place="end" n="1621" id="iv.iv.x-p37.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.x-p38"> Instead of <i>sanciuntur</i>,

their permanence, and there is no doubt that the term sanctity
(<i>sanctitatem</i>) is derived from sanction (<i>a sanciendo</i>).

this opinion, where it is thus written, &#8220;That which is born of

of the flesh, but, according to Christ, of the Holy Spirit.
Wherefore, if in this passage mention is made of the Holy Spirit,
when it is said, &#8220;For God is a Spirit,&#8221; they maintain that we
must take note that it is not said, &#8220;for the Spirit is God,&#8221;<note place="end" n="1625" id="iv.iv.x-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.x-p42"> <i>Quoniam Spiritus Deus

&#8220;for God is a Spirit;&#8221; so that the very Godhead of the Father

no mention of the Holy Spirit; this they affirm to be but an
application of the principle that, in general, the connection
itself is not wont to be enumerated among the things which are
connected with each other. Whence, also, those who read with closer
attention appear to recognize the express Trinity likewise in that
passage in which it is said, &#8220;For of Him, and through Him, and in
Him, are all things.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1630" id="iv.iv.x-p46.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.x-p47"> <scripRef passage="Rom. xi. 36" id="iv.iv.x-p47.2" parsed="|Rom|11|36|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.11.36">Rom. xi. 36</scripRef></p></note> &#8220;Of Him,&#8221; as if it meant, of

if it were, in that One who holds together, that is, unites by
connecting.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.iv.x-p48">20. Those parties oppose this
opinion who think that the said communion, which we call either
Godhead, or Love, or Charity, is not a substance. Moreover, they
require the Holy Spirit to be set forth to them according to
substance; neither do they take it to have been otherwise
impossible for the expression &#8220;God is Love&#8221; to have been used,
unless love were a substance. In this, indeed, they are influenced
by the wont of things of a bodily nature. For if two bodies are
connected with each other in such wise as to be placed in
juxtaposition one with the other, the connection itself is not a
body: inasmuch as when these bodies which had been connected are
separated, no such connection certainly is found [any more]; while,
at the same time, it is not understood to have departed, as it
were, and migrated, as is the case with those bodies themselves.
But men like these should make their heart pure, so far as they
can, in order that they may have power to see that in the substance
of God there is not anything of such a nature as would imply that
therein substance is one thing, and that which is accident to
substance (<i>aliud quod accidat subsanti&#339;</i>) another thing, and
not substance; whereas whatsoever can be taken to be therein is
substance. These things, however, can easily be spoken and
believed; but seen, so as to reveal how they are in themselves,
they absolutely cannot be, except by the pure heart. For which
reason, <pb n="331" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_331.html" id="iv.iv.x-Page_331"/>whether the opinion in question be true, or something
else be the case, the faith ought to be maintained unshaken, so
that we should call the Father God, the Son God, the Holy Spirit
God, and yet not affirm three Gods, but hold the said Trinity to be
one God; and again, not affirm these [Persons] to be different in
nature, but hold them to be of the same substance; and further
uphold it, not as if the Father were sometime the Son, and sometime
the Holy Spirit, but in such wise that the Father is always the
Father, and the Son always the Son, and the Holy Spirit always the
Holy Spirit. Neither should we make any affirmation on the subject
of things unseen rashly, as if we had knowledge, but [only
modestly] as believing. For these things cannot be seen except by
the heart made pure; and [even] he who in this life sees them &#8220;in
part,&#8221; as it has been said, and &#8220;in an enigma,&#8221;<note place="end" n="1631" id="iv.iv.x-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.x-p49"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiii. 12" id="iv.iv.x-p49.2" parsed="|1Cor|13|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.12">1 Cor. xiii. 12</scripRef></p></note> cannot

neither do the heretics belong to the Church catholic, which loves
God; nor do the schismatics form a part of the same, inasmuch as it
loves the neighbor, and consequently readily forgives the

extended to itself by Him who has reconciled us to Himself, doing
away with all past things, and calling us to a new life. And until
we reach the perfection of this new life, we cannot be without
sins. Nevertheless it is a matter of consequence of what sort those
sins may be.</p>

temporal, is more tardily bridled. But inasmuch as this same soul
is also made pure, and receives the stability of its own nature,
under the dominance of the spirit, which is the head for it, which
head of the said soul has again its own head in Christ, we ought
not to despair of the restoration of the body also to its own
proper nature. But this certainly will not be effected so speedily
as is the case with the soul; just as the soul too, is not restored
so speedily as the spirit. Yet it will take place in the

visible flesh, then, I say, which is the flesh properly so called,

mortal, even as it is designated corruptible in reference to vices
of manners. For assuredly it is &#8220;the death of the soul to
apostatize from God;&#8221;<note place="end" n="1646" id="iv.iv.xi-p15.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.xi-p16"> The text gives, <i>Mors quippe

or in that of cattle, we have both body and flesh. In the case of
celestial bodies, on the other hand, there is no flesh, but only
those simple and lucent bodies which the apostle designates
spiritual, while some call them ethereal. And consequently, when he

not contradict the resurrection of the flesh; but the sentence
predicates what will be the nature of that hereafter which at
present is flesh and blood. And if any one refuses to believe that
the flesh is capable of being changed into the sort of nature thus
indicated, he must be led on, step by step, to this faith. For if
you require of him whether earth is capable of being changed into
water, the nearness of the thing will make it not seem incredible
to him. Again, if you inquire whether water is capable of being
changed into air, he replies that this also is not absurd, for the
elements are near each other. And if, on the subject of the air, it
is asked whether that can be changed into an ethereal, that is, a
celestial body, the simple fact of the nearness at once convinces
him of the possibility of the thing. But if, then, he concedes that
through such gradations it is quite a possible thing that earth
should be changed into an ethereal body, why does he refuse to
believe, when that will of God, too, enters in addition, whereby a
human body had power to walk upon the waters, that the same change
is capable of being effected with the utmost rapidity, precisely in
accordance with the saying, &#8220;in the twinkling of an eye,&#8221;<note place="end" n="1650" id="iv.iv.xi-p20.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.iv.xi-p21"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xv. 52" id="iv.iv.xi-p21.2" parsed="|1Cor|15|52|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.52">1 Cor. xv. 52</scripRef></p></note> and
without any such gradations, even as, according to common wont,
smoke is changed into flame with marvellous quickness? For our
flesh assuredly is of earth. But philosophers, on the ground of

There</span> are those who think that the Christian religion is
what we should smile at rather than hold fast, for this reason,
that, in it, not what may be seen, is shown, but men are commanded
faith of things which are not seen. We therefore, that we may
refute these, who seem to themselves through prudence to be
unwilling to believe what they cannot see, although we are not able
to show unto human sight those divine things which we believe, yet
do show unto human minds that even those things which are not seen
are to be believed. And first they are to be admonished, (whom
folly hath so made subject to their carnal eyes, as that,
whatsoever they see not through them, they think not that they are
to believe,) how many things they not only believe but also know,
which cannot be seen by such eyes. Which things being without
number in our mind itself, (the nature of which mind is incapable
of being seen,) not to mention others, the very faith whereby we
believe, or the thought whereby we know that we either believe any
thing, or believe not, being as it is altogether alien from the
sight of those eyes; what so naked, so clear, what so certain is
there to the inner eyes of our minds? How then are we not to
believe what we see not with the eyes of the body, whereas, either
that we believe, or that we believe not, in a case where we cannot
apply the eyes of the body, we without any doubt see?</p>

2. But, say they, those things
which are in the mind, in that we can by the mind itself discern
them, we have no need to know through the eyes of the body; but
those things, which you say unto us that we should believe, you
neither point to without, that through the eyes of the body we may
know them; nor are they within, in our own mind, that by exercising
thought we may see them. And these things they so say, as though
any one would be bidden to believe, if that, which is believed, he
could already see set before him. Therefore certainly ought we to
believe certain temporal things also, which we see not, that we may
merit<note place="end" n="1653" id="iv.v.ii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v.ii-p2"> <i>Mereamur</i></p></note> to see
eternal things also, which we believe. But, whosoever thou art who
wilt not believe save what thou seest, lo, bodies that are present
thou seest with the eyes of the body, wills and thoughts of thine
own that are present, because they are in thine own mind, thou
seest by the mind itself; tell me, I pray thee, thy friend&#8217;s will
towards thee by what eyes seest thou? For no will can be seen by
the eyes of the body. What? see you in your own mind this
also <pb n="338" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_338.html" id="iv.v.ii-Page_338"/>which is going on in the mind of another? But if you see
it not, how do you repay in turn the good will of your friend, if
what you cannot see, you believe not? Will you haply say that you
see the will of another through his works? Therefore you will see
acts, and hear words, but concerning your friend&#8217;s will, that
which cannot be seen and heard you will believe. For that will is
not color or figure, so as to be thrown upon the eyes; or sound or
strain, so as to glide into the ears; nor indeed is it your own, so
as to be perceived by the motion<note place="end" n="1654" id="iv.v.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v.ii-p3"> <i>Affectione</i></p></note> of your own heart. It remains
therefore that, being neither seen, nor heard, nor beheld within
thyself, it be believed, that thy life be not left deserted without
any friendship, or affection bestowed upon thee be not repaid by
thee in return. Where then is that which thou saidest, that thou
oughtest not to believe, save what thou sawest either outwardly in
the body, or inwardly in the heart? Lo, out of thine own heart,
thou believest an heart not thine own; and lendest thy faith, where
thou dost not direct the glance of thy body or of thy mind. Thy
friend&#8217;s face thou discernest by thy own body, thy own faith thou
discernest by thine own mind; but thy friend&#8217;s faith is not loved
by thee, unless there be in thee in return that faith, whereby thou
mayest believe that which in him thou seest not. Although a man may
also deceive by feigning good will, and hiding malice: or, if he
have no thought to do harm, yet by expecting some benefit from
thee, feigns, because he has not, love.</p>

3. But you say, that you
therefore believe your friend, whose heart you cannot see, because
you have proved him in your trials, and have come to know of what
manner of spirit he was towards you in your dangers, wherein he
deserted you not. Seemeth it therefore to you that we must wish for
our own affliction, that our friend&#8217;s love towards us may be
proved? And shall no man be happy in most sure friends, unless he
shall be unhappy through adversity? so that, forsooth, he enjoy not
the tried love of the other, unless he be racked by pain and fear
of his own? And how in the having of true friends can that
happiness be wished for, and not rather feared, which nothing save
unhappiness can put to the proof? And yet it is true that a friend
may be had also in prosperity, but proved more surely in adversity.
But assuredly in order to prove him, neither would you commit
yourself to dangers of your own, unless you believed; and thus,
when you commit yourself in order to prove, you believe before you
prove. For surely, if we ought not to believe things not seen,<note place="end" n="1655" id="iv.v.iii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v.iii-p2"> The text seems corrupt. A <span class="c19" id="iv.v.iii-p2.1">ms</span>. in Brasenose Library reads, &#8220;<i>si non vis

since&#8221; etc.</p></note> since
indeed we believe the hearts of our friends, and that, not yet
surely proved; and, after we shall have proved them good by our own
ills, even then we believe rather than see their good will towards
us: except that so great is faith, that, not unsuitably, we judge
that we see, with certain eyes of it, that which we believe,
whereas we ought therefore to believe, because we cannot

4. If this faith be taken away
from human affairs, who but must observe how great disorder in
them, and how fearful confusion must follow? For who will be loved
by any with mutual affection, (being that the loving<note place="end" n="1656" id="iv.v.iv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v.iv-p2"> <i>Dilectio</i></p></note> itself is
invisible,) if what I see not, I ought not to believe? Therefore
will the whole of friendship perish, in that it consists not save
of mutual love. For what of it will it be able to receive from any,
if nothing of it shall be believed to be shown? Further, friendship
perishing, there will be preserved in the mind the bonds neither of
marriages, nor of kindreds and relations; because in these also
there is assuredly a friendly union of sentiment. Spouse therefore
will not be able to love spouse in turn, inasmuch as each believes
not the other&#8217;s love, because the love itself cannot be seen. Nor
will they long to have sons, who they believe not will make them a
return. And if these be born and grow up, much less will the
parents themselves love their own children, whose love towards
themselves in those children&#8217;s hearts they will not see, it being
invisible; if it be not praiseworthy faith, but blameable rashness,
to believe those things which are not seen. Why should I now speak
of the other connections, of brothers, sisters, sons-in-law, and
fathers-in-law, and of them who are joined together by any kindred
or affinity, if love is uncertain, and the will suspected, that of
parents by sons, and that of sons by parents, whilst due
benevolence is not rendered; because neither is it thought to be
due, that which is not seen in another not being thought to exist.
Further, if this caution be not a mark of ability,<note place="end" n="1657" id="iv.v.iv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v.iv-p3"> <i>Ingeniosa</i></p></note> but be
hateful, wherein we believe not that we are loved, because we see
not the love of them who love, and repay not them, unto whom we
think not that we owe a return; to that degree are human affairs
thrown into disorder, if what we see not we believe not, as to be
altogether and utterly overthrown, if we believe no wills of
men, <pb n="339" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_339.html" id="iv.v.iv-Page_339"/>which assuredly we cannot see. I omit to mention in how
many things they, who find fault with us because we believe what we
see not, believe report or history; or concerning places where they
have not themselves been; and say not, we believe not, because we
have not seen. Since if they say this, they are obliged to confess
that their own parents are not surely known to them: because on
this point also they have believed the accounts of others telling
of it, who yet are unable to show it, because it is a thing already
past; retaining themselves no sense of that time, and yet yielding
assent without any doubting to others speaking of that time: and
unless this be done, there must of necessity be incurred a
faithless impiety towards parents, whilst we are, as it were,
showing a rashness of belief in those things which we cannot see.
Since therefore, if we believe not those things which we cannot
see, human society itself, through concord perishing, will not
stand how much more is faith to be applied to divine things,
although they be not seen; failing the application of which, it is
not the friendship of some men or other, but the very chiefest bond

5. But you will say, the good
will of a friend towards me, although I cannot see it, yet can I
trace it out by many proofs; but you, what things you will us to

8. But as the wills of
friends, which are not seen, are believed through tokens which are
seen; thus the Church, which is now seen, is, of all things which
are not seen, but which are shown forth in those writings wherein
itself also is foretold, an index of the past, and a herald of the
future. Because both things past, which cannot now be seen, and
things present which cannot be seen all of them, at the time at
which they were foretold, no one of these could then be seen.
Therefore, since they have begun to come to pass as they were
foretold, from those things which have come to pass unto those
which are coming to pass, those things which were foretold
concerning Christ and the Church have run on in an ordered series:
unto which series these pertain concerning the day of Judgment,
concerning the resurrection of the dead, concerning the eternal
damnation of the ungodly with the devil, and concerning the eternal
recompense of the godly with Christ, things which, foretold in like
manner, are yet to come. Why therefore should we not believe the
first and the last things which we see not, when we have, as
witnesses of both, the things between, which we see, and in the
books of the Prophets either hear or read both <pb n="342" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_342.html" id="iv.v.viii-Page_342"/>the first
things, and the things between, and the last things, foretold

things to have been written by Christians, in order that those

be fulfilled in like manner as the rest, and that by the secret and

deserts. He indeed, Whom they crucified, and unto Whom they gave

might every where profit us. And this very thing which I assert,

were not slain, but scattered abroad; in order that, although they

on a sudden shone on the human race, when we see, (the false gods
now abandoned, and their images every where broken in pieces, their
temples overthrown or changed into other uses, and so many vain
rites plucked out by the roots from the most inveterate usage of
men,) the One True God invoked by all? And that this hath been
brought to pass-by One Man, by men mocked, seized, bound, scourged,
smitten with the palms of the hand, reviled, crucified, slain: His
disciples, (whom He chose common men,<note place="end" n="1685" id="iv.v.x-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v.x-p2"> <i>Idiotas</i></p></note> and unlearned, and fishermen, and
publicans, that by their means His teaching might be set forth,)
proclaiming His Resurrection, His Ascension, which they asserted
that they had seen, and being filled with the Holy Ghost, sounded
forth this Gospel, in all tongues which they had not learned. And
of them who heard them, part believed, part, believing not,
fiercely withstood them who preached. Thus while they were faithful
even unto death for the truth, strove not by returning evil, but by
enduring, overcame not by killing, but by dying; thus was the world
changed unto this religion, thus unto this Gospel were the hearts
of mortals turned, of men and women, of small and great, of learned
and unlearned, of wise and foolish, of mighty and weak, of noble
and ignoble, of high and low, and, throughout all nations the
Church shed abroad so increased, that even against the Catholic
faith itself there arises not any perverse sect, any kind of error,
which is found so to oppose itself to Christian truth, as that it
affect not and go not about to glory in the name of Christ: which
very error would not be suffered to spring up throughout the earth,
were it not that the very gainsaying exercised an wholesome
discipline. How<note place="end" n="1686" id="iv.v.x-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v.x-p3"> Lit. &#8220;when.&#8221;</p></note> would The

hath had its prophets and heralds going before, by whose divine
voices it was afore proclaimed; and when it hath come in such
manner as it was afore proclaimed, who is there so mad as to assert
that the Apostles lied concerning Christ, of Whom they preached
that He was come in such manner as the Prophets foretold afore that
He should come, which Prophets were not silent as to true things to
come concerning the Apostles themselves? For concerning these they
had said, &#8220;There is neither speech nor language, whereof their
voices are not heard; their sound went out into all the earth, and
their words unto the ends of the world.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1687" id="iv.v.x-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.v.x-p4"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xix. 3, 4" id="iv.v.x-p4.2" parsed="|Ps|19|3|19|4" osisRef="Bible:Ps.19.3-Ps.19.4">Ps. xix. 3, 4</scripRef></p></note> And this at any rate we see

I wrote a book <i>on the Profit of Believing</i>, to a friend of
mine who had been taken in by the Manichees, and whom I knew to be
still held in that error, and to deride the Catholic school of
Faith, in that men were bid believe, but not taught what was truth
by a most certain method. In this book I said, &amp;c. * * *. This book begins thus, <i>&#8220;Si mihi Honorate,

<p class="c49" id="iv.vi.i-p2">St. Augustin enumerates his book

wrote as Presbyter, to which order he was raised at Hippo about the
beginning of the year 391. The person for whom he wrote had been
led into error by himself, and appears to have been recovered from
it, at least if he is the same who wrote to St. Augustin from
Carthage about 412, proposing several questions, and to whom St.
Augustin wrote his 140th Epistle. Cassiodorus calls him a
Presbyter, though at that time he was not baptized. In <scripRef passage="Ep. 83" id="iv.vi.i-p2.1">Ep. 83</scripRef>, St.

1. IF, Honoratus, a heretic,
and a man trusting heretics seemed to me one and the same, I should
judge it my duty to remain silent both in tongue and pen in this
matter. But now, whereas there is a very great difference between
these two: forasmuch as he, in my opinion, is an heretic, who, for
the sake of some temporal advantage, and chiefly for the sake of
his own glory and pre-eminence, either gives birth to, or follows,
false and new opinions; but he, who trusts men of this kind, is a
man deceived by a certain imagination of truth and piety. This
being the case, I have not thought it my duty to be silent towards
you, as to my opinions on the finding and retaining of truth: with
great love of which, as you know, we have burned from our very
earliest youth: but it is a thing far removed from the minds of
vain men, who, having too far advanced and fallen into these
corporeal things, think that there is nothing else than what they
perceive by those five well-known reporters of the body; and what
impressions<note place="end" n="1693" id="iv.vi.ii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.ii-p2"> <i>Plagas</i></p></note> and images
they have received from these, they carry over with themselves,
even when they essay to withdraw from the senses; and by the deadly
and most deceitful rule of these think that they measure most
rightly the unspeakable recesses of truth. Nothing is more easy, my
dearest friend, than for one not only to say, but also to think,
that he hath found out the truth; but how difficult it is in
reality, you will perceive, I trust, from this letter of mine. And
that this may profit you, or at any rate may in no way harm you,
and also all, into whose hands it shall chance to come,
<pb n="348" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_348.html" id="iv.vi.ii-Page_348"/>I have

forasmuch as<note place="end" n="1694" id="iv.vi.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.ii-p3"> <i>Si</i></p></note> I am fully

2. It is then my purpose to
prove to you, if I can, that the Manichees profanely and rashly
inveigh against those, who, following the authority of the Catholic
Faith, before that they are able to gaze upon that Truth, which the
pure mind beholds, are by believing forearmed, and prepared for God
Who is about to give them light. For you know, Honoratus, that for
no other reason we fell in with such men, than because they used to
say, that, apart from all terror of authority, by pure and simple
reason, they would lead within to God, and set free from all error
those who were willing to be their hearers. For what else
constrained me, during nearly nine years, spurning the religion
which had been set in me from a child by my parents, to be a
follower and diligent hearer of those men,<note place="end" n="1695" id="iv.vi.iii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.iii-p2"> Confess. b. i. c. 11; b. v. c.
14.</p></note> save that they said that we are
alarmed by superstition, and are commanded to have faith before
reason, but that they urge no one to have faith, without having
first discussed and made clear the truth? Who would not be enticed
by such promises, especially the mind of a young man desirous of
the truth, and further a proud and talkative mind by discussions of
certain learned men in the school? such as they then found me,
disdainful forsooth as of old wives&#8217; fables, and desirous to
grasp and drink in, what they promised, the open and pure Truth?
But what reason, on the other hand, recalled me, not to be
altogether joined to them, so that I continued in that rank which
they call of Hearers, so that I resigned not the hope and business
of this world; save that I noticed that they also are rather
eloquent and full in refutation of others, than abide firm and sure
in proof of what is their own. But of myself what shall I say, who
was already a Catholic Christian? teats which now, after very long
thirst, I almost exhausted and dry, have returned to with all
greediness, and with deeper weeping and groaning have shaken
together and wrung them out more deeply, that so there might flow
what might be enough to refresh me affected as I was, and to bring
back hope of life and safety. What then shall I say of myself? You,
not yet a Christian, who, through encouragement from me, execrating
them greatly as you did, were hardly led to believe that you ought
to listen to them and make trial of them, by what else, I pray you,
were you delighted, call to mind, I entreat you, save by a certain
great presumption and promise of reasons? But because they disputed
long and much with very great copiousness and vehemence concerning
the errors of unlearned men, a thing which I learned too late at
length to be most easy for any moderately educated man; if even of
their own they implanted in us any thing, we thought that we were
obliged to retain it, insomuch as there fell not in our way other
things, wherein to acquiesce. So they did in our case what crafty
fowlers are wont to do, who set branches smeared with bird-lime
beside water to deceive thirsty birds. For they fill up and cover
anyhow the other waters which are around, or fright them from them
by alarming devices, that they may fall into their snares, not
through choice, but want.</p>

3. But why do I not make
answer to myself, that these fair and clever similies, and charges
of this nature may be poured forth against all who are teachers of
any thing by any adversary, with abundance of wit and sarcasm? But
I thought that I ought to insert something of this kind in my
letter, in order to admonish them to give over such proceedings; so
that, as he<note place="end" n="1696" id="iv.vi.iv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.iv-p2"> <i>Cicero</i></p></note> says,
apart from trifles of common-places, matter may contend with
matter, cause with cause, reason with reason. Wherefore let them
give over that saying, which they have in their mouths as though of
necessity, when any one, who hath been for some long time a hearer,
hath left them; &#8220;The Light hath made a passage through him.&#8221;
For you see, you who are my chief care, (for I am not over anxious
about them,) how empty this is, and most easy for any one to find
fault with. Therefore I leave this for your own wisdom to consider.
For I have no fear that you will think me possessed by indwelling
Light, when I was entangled in the life of this world, having a
darkened hope, of beauty of wife, of pomp of riches, of emptiness
of honors, and of all other hurtful and deadly pleasures. For all
these, as is not unknown to you, I ceased not to desire and hope
for, at the time when I was their attentive hearer. And I do not
lay this to the charge of their teaching; for I also confess that
they also carefully advise to shun these. But now to say that I am
deserted by light, when I have turned myself from all these shadows
of things, and have determined to be content with that diet merely
which is necessary for health of body; but that I was enlightened
and shining, at a time when I loved these things, and was wrapped
up in <pb n="349" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_349.html" id="iv.vi.iv-Page_349"/>them, is the part of a man, to use the mildest
expression, wanting in a keen insight into matters, on which he
loves to speak at length. But, if you please, let us come to the
cause in hand.</p>

4. For you well know that the
Manichees move the unlearned by finding fault with the Catholic
Faith, and chiefly by rending in pieces and tearing the Old
Testament: and they are utterly ignorant, how far<note place="end" n="1697" id="iv.vi.v-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.v-p2"> <i>Quatenus</i></p></note> these
things are to be taken, and how drawn out they descend with profit
into the veins and marrows of souls as yet as it were but able to
cry.<note place="end" n="1698" id="iv.vi.v-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.v-p3"> <i>Vagientium</i></p></note> And
because there are in them certain things which are some slight
offense to minds ignorant and careless of themselves, (and there
are very many such,) they admit of being accused in a popular way:
but defended in a popular way they cannot be, by any great number
of persons, by reason of the mysteries that are contained in them.
But the few, who know how to do this, do not love public and much
talked of controversies and disputes:<note place="end" n="1699" id="iv.vi.v-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.v-p4"> <i>Famigerula</i></p></note> and on this account are very
little known, save to such as are most earnest in seeking them out.
Concerning then this rashness of the Manichees, whereby they find
fault with the Old Testament and the Catholic Faith, listen, I
entreat you, to the considerations which move me. But I desire and
hope that you will receive them in the same spirit in which I say
them. For God, unto Whom are known the secrets of my conscience
knows, that in this discourse I am doing nothing of evil craft;
but, as I think it should be received, for the sake of proving the
truth, for which one thing we have now long ago determined to live;
and with incredible anxiety, lest it may have been most easy for me
to err with you, but most difficult, to use no harder term, to hold
the right way with you. But I venture<note place="end" n="1700" id="iv.vi.v-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.v-p5"> <i>Pr&#230;sumo</i></p></note> to anticipate that, in this hope,
wherein I hope that you will hold with us the way of wisdom, He
will not fail me, unto Whom I have been consecrated; Whom day and
night I endeavor to gaze upon: and since, by reason of my sins, and
by reason of past habit, having the eye of the mind wounded by
strokes of feeble opinions, I know that I am without strength, I
often entreat with tears, and as, after long blindness and darkness
the eyes being hardly opened, and as yet, by frequent throbbing and
turning away, refusing the light which yet they long after;
specially if one endeavor to show to them the very sun; so it has
now befallen me, who do not deny that there is a certain
unspeakable and singular good of the soul, which the mind sees; and
who with tears and groaning confess that I am not yet worthy of it.
He will not then fail me, if I feign nothing, if I am led by duty,
if I love truth, if I esteem friendship, if I fear much lest you be
deceived.</p>

5. All that Scripture
therefore, which is called the Old Testament, is handed down
fourfold to them who desire to know it, according to history,
according to &#230;tiology, according to analogy, according to
allegory. Do not think me silly for using Greek words. In the first
place, because I have so received, nor do I dare to make known to
you otherwise than I have received. Next you yourself perceive,
that we have not in use terms for such things: and had I translated
and made such, I should have been indeed more silly: but, were I to
use circumlocution, I should be less free in treating: this only I
pray you to believe, that in whatever way I err, I am not inflated
or swollen in any thing that I do. Thus (for example) it is handed
down according to history, when there is taught what hath been
written, or what hath been done; what not done, but only written as
though it had been done. According to &#230;tiology, when it is shown
for what cause any thing hath been done or said. According to
analogy, when it is shown that the two Testaments, the Old and the
New, are not contrary the one to the other. According to allegory,
when it is taught that certain things which have been written are
not to be taken in the letter, but are to be understood in a
figure.</p>

6. All these ways our Lord
Jesus Christ and His Apostles used. For when it had been objected
that His disciples had plucked the ears of corn on the sabbath-day,
the instance was taken from history; &#8220;Have ye not read,&#8221; saith
He, &#8220;what David did when he was an hungered, and they that were
with him; how he entered into the house of God, and did eat the
shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them
that were with him, but only for the priests?&#8221;<note place="end" n="1701" id="iv.vi.vii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.vii-p2"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 12.3,4" id="iv.vi.vii-p2.1" parsed="|Matt|12|3|12|4" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.3-Matt.12.4">Matt. xii. 3, 4</scripRef></p></note> But the instance pertains to
&#230;tiology, that, when Christ had forbidden a wife to be put away,
save for the cause of fornication, and they, who asked Him, had
alleged that Moses had granted permission after a writing of
divorcement had been given, This, saith He, &#8220;Moses did because of
the hardness of your heart.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1702" id="iv.vi.vii-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.vii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 19.8" id="iv.vi.vii-p3.1" parsed="|Matt|19|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.8">Matt. xix. 8</scripRef></p></note> For here a reason was given, why
that had been well allowed by Moses for a time; that this command
of Christ might seem to show that now the times were other. But it
were long to explain the changes of these times, and <pb n="350" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_350.html" id="iv.vi.vii-Page_350"/>their order
arranged and settled by a certain marvellous appointment of Divine
Providence.</p>

7. And further, analogy,
whereby the agreement of both Testaments is plainly seen, why shall
I say that all have made use of, to whose authority they yield;
whereas it is in their power to consider with themselves, how many
things they are wont to say have been inserted in the divine
Scriptures by certain, I know not who, corrupters of truth? Which
speech of theirs I always thought to be most weak, even at the time
that I was their hearer: nor I alone, but you also, (for I well
remember,) and all of us, who essayed to exercise a little more
care in forming a judgment than the crowd of hearers. But now,
after that many things have been expounded and made clear to me,
which used chiefly to move me: those I mean, wherein their
discourse for the most part boasts itself, and expatiates the more
freely, the more safely it can do so as having no opponent; it
seems to me that there is no assertion of theirs more shameless, or
(to use a milder phrase) more careless and weak than that the
divine Scriptures have been corrupted; whereas there are no copies
in existence, in a matter of so recent date, whereby they can prove
it. For were they to assert, that they thought not that they ought
thoroughly to receive them, because they had been written by
persons, who they thought had not written the truth; any how their
refusal<note place="end" n="1703" id="iv.vi.viii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.viii-p2"> <i>Tergiversatio</i></p></note> would be
more right, or their error more natural.<note place="end" n="1704" id="iv.vi.viii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.viii-p3"> <i>Humanior</i></p></note> For this is what they have done in
the case of the Book which is inscribed the Acts of the Apostles.
And this device of theirs, when I consider with myself, I cannot
enough wonder at. For it is not the want of wisdom in the men that
I complain of in this matter, but the want of ordinary
understanding.<note place="end" n="1705" id="iv.vi.viii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.viii-p4"> <i>Cor mediocre</i></p></note> For that
book hath so great matters, which are like what they receive, that
it seems to me great folly to refuse to receive this book also, and
if any thing offend them there to call it false and inserted. Or,
if such language is shameless, as it is why in the Epistles of
Paul, why in the four books of the Gospel, do they think that
they<note place="end" n="1706" id="iv.vi.viii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.viii-p5"> <i>Ea</i></p></note> are of any
avail, in which I am not sure but that there are in proportion many
more things, than could be in that book, which they will have
believed to have been interpolated by falsifiers. But forsooth this
is what I believe to be the case, and I ask of you to consider it
with me with as calm and serene a judgment as possible. For you
know that, essaying to bring the person of their founder Manich&#230;us
into the number of the Apostles, they say that the Holy Spirit,
Whom the Lord promised His disciples that He would send, hath come

not find how to say that it was interpolated. For they will have it
that there were some, I know not who, falsifiers of the divine

the Gospel. But this they cannot say concerning the Holy Spirit,
unless haply they assert that those persons divined, and set in
their books what should be brought forward against Manich&#230;us, who
should at some future time arise, and say that the Holy Spirit had
been sent through him. But concerning the Holy Spirit we will speak
somewhat more plainly in another place. Now let us return to my

8. For that both history of
the Old Testament, and &#230;tiology, and analogy are found in the New
Testament, has been, as I think, sufficiently proved: it remains to
show this of allegory. Our Redeemer Himself in the Gospel uses
allegory out of the Old Testament. &#8220;This generation,&#8221; saith He,
&#8220;seeketh a sign, and there shall not be given it save the sign of
Jonas the prophet. For as Jonas was three days and three nights in
the whale&#8217;s belly, so also shall the Son of Man be three days and

and all passed through the sea, and were all baptized into Moses,
in the cloud, and in the sea, and did all eat the same spiritual
meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of
the spiritual Rock that followed with them; and that Rock was
Christ. But in the more part of them God was not well pleased: for
they were overthrown in the wilderness. But these things were

three and twenty thousand men. Neither let us tempt <pb n="351" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_351.html" id="iv.vi.ix-Page_351"/>Christ, as

also in the Apostle a certain allegory, which indeed greatly
relates to the cause in hand, for this reason that they themselves

written, that Abraham had two sons, one of a bond-maid, and one of
a free woman. But he who was of the bond-maid was born after the

9. Here therefore these men
too evil, while they essay to make void the Law, force us to
approve these Scriptures. For they mark what is said, that they who
are under the Law are in bondage, and they keep flying above the
rest that last saying, &#8220;Ye are made empty<note place="end" n="1715" id="iv.vi.x-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.x-p2"> <i>Ventilant</i></p></note> of Christ, as many of you as are

that all these things are true, and we say that the Law is not
necessary, save for them unto whom bondage is yet profitable: and
that the Law was on this account profitably enacted, in that men,
who could not be recalled from sins by reason, needed to be
restrained by such a Law, that is to say, by the threats and
terrors of those punishments which can be seen by fools: from which
when the Grace of Christ sets us free, it condemns not that Law,
but invites us at length to yield obedience to its love, not to be
slaves to the fear of the Law. Itself is Grace, that is free
gift,<note place="end" n="1717" id="iv.vi.x-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.x-p4"> <i>Beneficium</i></p></note> which they
understand not to have come to them from God, who still desire to
be under the bonds of the Law. Whom Paul deservedly rebukes as
unbelievers, because they do not believe that now through our Lord
Jesus they have been set free from that bondage, under which they
were placed for a certain time by the most just appointment of God.
Hence is that saying of the same Apostle, &#8220;For the Law was our

schoolmaster to fear, Who after gave a Master to love. And yet in
these precepts and commands of the Law, which now it is not allowed
Christians to use, such as either the Sabbath, or Circumcision, or

10. But, passing over in the
mean while the depth of knowledge, to deal with you as I think I
ought to deal with my intimate friend; that is, as I have myself
power, not as I have wondered at the power of very learned men;
there are three kinds of error, whereby men err, when they read
anything. I will speak of them one by one. The first kind is,
wherein that which is false is thought true, whereas the writer
thought otherwise. A second kind, although not so extensive, yet
not less hurtful, when that, which is false, is <pb n="352" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_352.html" id="iv.vi.xi-Page_352"/>thought
true, yet the thought is the same as that of the writer. A third
kind, when from the writing of another some truth is understood,
whereas the writer understood it not. In which kind there is no
little profit, rather, if you consider carefully, the whole entire
fruit of reading. An instance of the first kind is, as if any one,
for example, should say and believe that Rhadamanthus hears and
judges the causes of the dead in the realms below, because he hath
so read in the strain of Maro.<note place="end" n="1724" id="iv.vi.xi-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xi-p2"> Virg. <i>&#198;n.</i> vi.
566&#8211;569.</p></note> For this one errs in two ways:
both in that he believes a thing not to be believed, and also in
that he, whom he reads, is not to be thought to have believed it.
The second kind may be thus noticed: if one, because Lucretius
writes that the soul is formed of atoms, and that after death it is
dissolved into the same atoms and perishes, were to think this to
be true and what he ought to believe. For this one also is not less
wretched, if, in a matter of so great moment, he hath persuaded
himself of that which is false, as certain; although Lucretius, by
whose books he hath been deceived, held this opinion. For what doth
it profit this one to be assured of the meaning of the author,
whereas he hath chosen him to himself not so as through him to
escape error, but so as with him to err. An instance suited to the
third kind is, if one, after having read in the books of Epicurus
some place wherein he praises continence, were to assert that he
had made the chief good to consist in virtue, and that therefore he
is not to be blamed. For how is this man injured by the error of
Epicurus, what though Epicurus believe that bodily pleasure is the
chief good of man: whereas he hath not surrendered up himself to so
base and hurtful an opinion, and is pleased with Epicurus for no
other reason, than that he thinks him not to have held sentiments
which ought not to be holden. This error is not only natural to
man,<note place="end" n="1725" id="iv.vi.xi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xi-p3"> <i>Humanus</i></p></note> but often
also most worthy of a man. For what, if word were brought to me,
concerning some one whom I loved, that, when now he was of bearded
age, he had said, in the hearing of many, that he was so pleased
with boyhood and childhood, as even to swear that he wished to live
after the same fashion, and that that was so proved to me, as that
I should be shameless to deny it: I should not, should I, seem
worthy of blame, if I thought that, in saying this, he wished to
show, that he was pleased with the innocence, and with the temper
of mind alien from those desires in which the race of man is
wrapped up, and from this circumstance should love him yet more and
more, than I used to love him before; although perhaps he had been
foolish enough to love in the age of children a certain freedom in
play and food, and an idle ease? For suppose that he had died after
this report had reached me, and that I had been unable to make any
inquiry of him, so as for him to open his meaning; would there be
any one so shameless as to be angry with me, for praising the
man&#8217;s purpose and wish, through those very words which I had
heard? What, that even a just judge of matters would not hesitate
perhaps to praise my sentiment and wish, in that both I was pleased
with innocence, and, as man of man, in a matter of doubt, preferred
to think well, when it was in my power also to think
ill?</p>

11. And, this being so, hear
also just so many conditions and differences of the same
Scriptures. For it must be that just so many meet us. For either
any one hath written profitably, and is not profitably understood
by some one: or both take place unprofitably: or the reader
understands profitably, whereas he, who is read, hath written
contrariwise. Of these the first I blame not, the last I regard
not. For neither can I blame the man, who without any fault of his
own hath been ill understood; nor can I be distressed at any one
being read, who hath failed to see the truth, when I see that the
readers are no way injured. There is then one kind most approved,
and as it were most cleansed, when both the things written are
well, and are taken in a good sense by the readers. And yet that
also is still further divided into two: for it doth not altogether
shut out error. For it generally comes to pass, that, when a writer
hath held a good sense, the reader also holds a good sense; still
other than he, and often better, often worse, yet profitably. But
when both we hold the same sense as he whom we read, and that is
every way suited to right conduct of life, there is the fullest
possible measure of truth, and there is no place opened for error
from any other quarter. And this kind is altogether very rare, when
what we read is matter of extreme obscurity: nor can it, in my
opinion, be clearly known, but only believed. For by what proofs
shall I so gather the will of a man who is absent or dead, as that
I can swear to it: when, even if he were questioned being present,
there might be many things, which, if he were no ill man, he would
most carefully hide? But I think that it hath nothing to do towards
learning the matter of fact, of what character the writer was; yet
is he most fairly believed good, whose writings have benefited the
human race and posterity.</p>

12. Wherefore
I would that they would tell me, in what kind they place the,
supposed, error of the Catholic Church. If in the first, it is
altogether a grave charge; but it needs not a far-fetched defense:
for it is enough to deny that we so understand, as the persons, who
inveigh against us, suppose. If in the second, the charge is not
less grave; but they shall be refuted by the same saying. If in the
third, it is no charge at all. Proceed, and next consider the
Scriptures themselves. For what objection do they raise against the
books of (what is called) the Old Testament? Is it that they are
good, but are understood by us in an ill sense? But they themselves
do not receive them. Or is it that they are neither good, nor are
well understood? But our defense above is enough to drive them from
this position. Or is it this that they will say, although they are
understood by you in a good sense, yet they are evil? What is this
other than to acquit living adversaries, with whom they have to do,
and to accuse men long ago dead, with whom they have no strife? I
indeed believe that both those men profitably delivered to memory
all things, and that they were great and divine. And that that Law
was published, and framed by the command and will of God: and of
this, although I have but very slight knowledge of books of that
kind, yet I can easily persuade any, if there apply to me a mind
fair and no way obstinate: and this I will do, when you shall grant
to me your ears and mind well disposed: this however when it shall
be in my power: but now is it not enough for me, however that
matter may stand, not to have been deceived?</p>

13. I call to witness,
Honoratus, my conscience, and God Who hath His dwelling in pure
souls, that I account nothing more prudent, chaste, and religious,
than are all those Scriptures, which under the name of the Old
Testament the Catholic Church retains. You wonder at this, I am
aware. For I cannot hide that we were far otherwise persuaded. But
there is indeed nothing more full of rashness, (which at that time,
being boys, we had in us,) than in the case of each several book,
to desert expounders, who profess that they hold them, and that
they can deliver them to their scholars, and to seek their meaning
from those, who, I know not from what cause compelling, have
proclaimed a most bitter war against the framers and authors of
them. For who ever thought that the hidden and dark books of
Aristotle were to be expounded to him by one who was the enemy of
Aristotle; to speak of these systems of teaching, wherein a reader
may perhaps err without sacrilege? Who, in fine, willed to read or
learn the geometrical writings of Archimedes, under Epicurus as a
master; against which Epicurus used to argue with great obstinacy,
so far as I judge, understanding them not at all? What are those
Scriptures of the law most plain, against which, as though set
forth in public, these men make their attack in vain and to no
purpose? And they seem to me to be like that weak woman, whom these
same men are wont to mock at, who enraged at the sun being extolled
to her, and recommended as an object of worship by a certain female
Manichee, being as she was simple-minded and of a religions spirit,
leaped up in haste, and often striking with her foot that spot on
which the sun through the window cast light, began to cry out, Lo,
I trample on the sun and your God: altogether after a foolish and
womanish manner; Who denies it? But do not those men seem to you to
be such, who, in matters which they understand not, either
wherefore, or altogether of what kind they are, although like to
matters cast in the way,<note place="end" n="1726" id="iv.vi.xiv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xiv-p2"> <i>Jacentibus</i></p></note> yet to such as understand them
exact<note place="end" n="1727" id="iv.vi.xiv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xiv-p3"> <i>Subtilia</i></p></note> and
divine, rending them with great onset of speech and reproaches,
think that they are effecting something, because the unlearned
applaud them? Believe me, whatever there is in these Scriptures, it
is lofty and divine: there is in them altogether truth, and a
system of teaching most suited to refresh and renew minds: and
clearly so ordered in measure, as that there is no one but may draw
thence, what is enough for himself, if only he approach to draw
with devotion and piety, as true religion demands. To prove this to
you, needs many reasons and a longer discourse. For first I must so
treat with you as that you may not hate the authors themselves;
next, so as that you may love them: and this I must treat in any
other way, rather than by expounding their meanings and words. For
this reason, because in case we hated Virgil, nay, rather in case
we loved him not, before understanding him, by the commendation of
our forefathers, we should never be satisfied on those questions
about him without number, by which grammarians are wont to be
disquieted and troubled; nor should we listen willingly to one who
solved these at the same time praising him; but should favor that
one who by means of these essayed to show that he had erred and
doated. But now, whereas many essay to open these, and each (in a
different way according to his capacity, we applaud these in
preference, through whose exposition the poet is found better, who
is believed, even by those who do not 
<pb n="354" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_354.html" id="iv.vi.xiv-Page_354"/>understand him, not only
in nothing to have offended, but also to have sung nothing but what
was worthy of praise. So that in some minute question, we are
rather angry with the master who fails, and has not what to answer,
than think him silent through any fault in Maro. And now, if, in
order to defend himself, he should wish to assert a fault in so
great an author, hardly will his scholars remain with him, even
after they have paid his fee. How great matter were it, that we
should shew like good will towards them, of whom it hath been
confirmed by so long time of old that the Holy Spirit spake by
them? But, forsooth, we youths of the greatest understanding, and
marvellous searchers out of reasons, without having at least
unrolled these writings, without having sought teachers, without
having somewhat chided our own dullness, lastly, without having
yielded our heart even in a measure<note place="end" n="1728" id="iv.vi.xiv-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xiv-p4"> <i>Mediocri corde</i></p></note> to those who have willed that
writings of this kind be so long read, kept, and handled through
the whole world; have thought that nothing in them is to be
believed, moved by the speech of those who are unfriendly and
hostile to them, with whom, under a false promise of reason, we
should be compelled to believe and cherish thousands of
fables.</p>

14. But now I will proceed
with what I have begun, if I can, and I will so treat with you, as
not in the mean while to lay open the Catholic Faith, but, in order
that they may search out its great mysteries, to show to those who
have a care for their souls, hope of divine fruit, and of the
discerning of truth. No one doubts of him who seeks true religion,
either that he already believes that there is an immortal soul for
that religion to profit, or that he also wishes to find that very
thing in this same religion. Therefore all religion is for the sake
of the soul; for howsoever the nature of the body may be, it causes
no care or anxiety, especially after death, to him, whose soul
possesses that whereby it is blessed. For the sake of the soul,
therefore, either alone or chiefly, hath true religion, if there be
any such, been appointed. But this soul, (I will consider for what
reason, and I confess the matter to be most obscure,) yet errs, and
is foolish, as we see, until it attain to and perceive wisdom, and
perhaps this very [wisdom] is true religion. I am not, am I,
sending you to fables? I am not, am I, forcing you to believe
rashly? I say that our soul entangled and sunk in error and folly
seeks the way of truth, if there be any such. If this be not your
case, pardon me, I pray, and share with me your wisdom; but if you
recognize in yourself what I say, let us, I entreat, together seek
the truth.</p>

15. Put the case that we have
not as yet heard a teacher of any religion. Lo we have undertaken a
new matter and business. We must seek, I suppose, them who profess
this matter, if it have any existence. Suppose that we have found
different persons holding different opinions, and through their
difference of opinions seeking to draw persons each one to himself:
but that, in the mean while, there are certain pre-eminent from
being much spoken of, and from having possession of nearly all
peoples. Whether these hold the truth, is a great question: but
ought we not to make full trial of them first, in order that, so
long as we err, being as we are men, we may seem to err with the
human race itself?</p>

16. But it will be said, the
truth is with some few; therefore you already know what it is, if
you know with whom it is. Said I not a little above, that we were
in search of it as unlearned men? But if from the very force of
truth you conjecture that few possess it, but know not who they
are; what if it is thus, that there are so few who know the truth,
as that they hold the multitude by their authority, whence the
small number may set itself free, and, as it were, strain itself<note place="end" n="1729" id="iv.vi.xvii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xvii-p2"> <i>Eliquare</i></p></note> forth into
those secrets? Do we not see how few attain the highest eloquence,
whereas through the whole world the schools of rhetoricians are
resounding with troops of young men? What, do they, as many as
desire to turn out good orators, alarmed at the multitude of the
unlearned, think that they are to bestow their labor on the
orations of C&#230;cilius, or Erucius, rather than those of Tullius?
All aim at these, which are confirmed by authority of our
forefathers. Crowds of unlearned persons essay to learn the same,
which by the few learned are received as to be learned: yet very
few attain, yet fewer practise, the very fewest possible become
famous. What, if true religion be some such thing? What if a
multitude of unlearned persons attend the Churches, and yet that be
no proof, that therefore no one is made perfect by these mysteries?
And yet, if they who studied eloquence were as few as the few who
are eloquent, our parents would never believe that we ought to be
committed to such masters. Whereas, then, we have been called to
these studies by a multitude, which is numerous in that portion of
it which is made up of the unlearned, so as to become enamored of
that which few can attain unto; why are we unwill<pb n="355" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_355.html" id="iv.vi.xvii-Page_355"/>ing to be in
the same case in religion, which perhaps we despise with great
danger to our soul? For if the truest and purest worship of God,
although it be found with a few, be yet found with those, with whom
a multitude albeit wrapped up in lusts, and removed far from purity
of understanding, agrees; (and who can doubt that this may happen?)
I ask, if one were to charge us with rashness and folly, that we
seek not diligently with them who teach it, that, which we are
greatly anxious to discover, what can we answer? [Shall we say,] I
was deterred by numbers? Why from the pursuit of liberal arts,
which hardly bring any profit to this present life; why from search
after money? Why from attaining unto honor; why, in fine, from
gaining and keeping good health; lastly, why from the very aim at a
happy life; whereas all are engaged in these, few excel; were you
deterred by no numbers?</p>

17. &#8220;But they seemed there
to make absurd statements.&#8221; On whose assertion? Forsooth on that
of enemies, for whatever cause, for whatever reason, for this is
not now the question, still enemies. Upon reading, I found it so of
myself. Is it so? Without having received any instruction in
poetry, you would not dare to essay to read Terentianus Maurus
without a master: Asper, Cornutus, Donatus, and others without
number are needed, that any poet whatever may be understood, whose
strains seem to court even the applause of the theatre; do you in
the case of those books, which, however they may be, yet by the
confession of well-nigh the whole human race are commonly reported
to be sacred and full of divine things, rush upon them without a
guide, and dare to deliver an opinion on them without a teacher;
and, if there meet you any matters, which seem absurd, do not
accuse rather your own dullness, and mind decayed by the corruption
of this world, such as is that of all that are foolish, than those
[books] which haply cannot be understood by such persons! You
should seek some one at once pious and learned, or who by consent
of many was said to be such, that you might be both bettered by his
advice, and instructed by his learning. Was he not easy to find? He
should be searched out with pains. Was there no one in the country
in which you lived? What cause could more profitably force to
travel? Was he quite hidden, or did he not exist on the continent<note place="end" n="1730" id="iv.vi.xviii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xviii-p2"> <i>Continenti</i></p></note>? One
should cross the sea. If across the sea he was not found in any
place near to us, you should proceed even as far as those lands, in
which the things related in those books are said to have taken
place. What, Honoratus, have we done of this kind? And yet a
religion perhaps the most holy, (for as yet I am speaking as though
it were matter of doubt,) the opinion whereof hath by this time
taken possession of the whole world, we wretched boys condemned at
our own discretion and sentence. What if those things which in
those same Scriptures seem to offend some unlearned persons, were
so set there for this purpose, that when things were read of such
as are abhorrent from the feeling of ordinary men, not to say of
wise and holy men, we might with much more earnestness seek the
hidden meaning. Perceive you not how the Catamite of the
Bucolics,<note place="end" n="1731" id="iv.vi.xviii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xviii-p3"> Virg. Ecl. ii.</p></note> for whom
the rough shepherd gushed forth into tears, men essay to interpret,
and affirm that the boy Alexis, on whom Plato also is said to have
composed a love strain, hath some great meaning or other, but
escapes the judgment of the unlearned; whereas without any
sacrilege a poet however rich may seem to have published wanton
songs?</p>

18. But in truth was there
either decree of any law, or power of gainsayers, or vile character
of persons consecrated, or shameful report, or newness of
institution, or hidden profession, to recall us from, and forbid
us, the search? There is nothing of these. All laws divine and
human allow us to seek the Catholic Faith; but to hold and exercise
it is allowed us at any rate by human law, even if so long as we
are in error there be a doubt concerning divine law; no enemy
alarms our weakness, (although truth and the salvation of the soul,
in case being diligently sought it be not found where it may with
most safety, ought to be sought at any risk); the degrees of all
ranks and powers most devotedly minister to this divine worship;
the name of religion is most honorable and most famous. What, I
pray, hinders to search out and discuss with pious and careful
enquiry, whether there be here that which it must needs be few know
and guard in entire purity, although the goodwill and affection of
all nations conspire in its favor?</p>

19. The case standing thus,
suppose, as I said, that we are now for the first time seeking unto
what religion we shall deliver up our souls, for it to cleanse and
renew them; without doubt we must begin with the Catholic Church.
For by this time there are more Christians, than if the Jews and
idolaters be added together. But of these same Christians, whereas
there are several heresies, and all wish to appear Catholics, and
call all others besides themselves heretics, there is one
<pb n="356" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_356.html" id="iv.vi.xx-Page_356"/>Church, as all allow: if you consider the whole world,
more full filled in number; but, as they who know affirm, more pure
also in truth than all the rest. But the question of truth is
another; but, what is enough for such as are in search, there is
one Catholic, to which different heresies give different names
whereas they themselves are called each by names of their own,
which they dare not deny. From which may be understood, by judgment
of umpires who are hindered by no favor, to which is to be assigned
the name Catholic, which all covet. But, that no one may suppose
that it is to be made matter of over garrulous or unnecessary
discussion, this is at any rate one, in which human laws themselves
also are in a certain way Christian. I do not wish any prejudgment
to be formed from this fact, but I account it a most favorable
commencement for enquiry. For we are not to fear lest the true
worship of God; resting on no strength of its own, seem to need to
be supported by them whom it ought to support: but, at any rate, it
is perfect happiness, if the truth may be there found, where it is
most safe both to search for it and to hold it: in case it cannot,
then at length, at whatever risk, we must go and search some other
where.</p>

20. Having then laid down
these principles, which, as I think, are so just that I ought to
win this cause before you, let who will be my adversary, I will set
forth to you, as I am able, what way I followed, when I was
searching after true religion in that spirit, in which I have now
set forth that it ought to be sought. For upon leaving you and
crossing the sea, now delaying and hesitating, what I ought to
hold, what to let go; which delay rose upon me every day the more,
from the time that I was a hearer of that man,<note place="end" n="1732" id="iv.vi.xxi-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxi-p2"> i.e. Faustus. v. Conf. b. v. c.
vi. &#167; 10</p></note> whose coming was promised to us,
as you know, as if from heaven, to explain all things which moved
us, and found him, with the exception of a certain eloquence, such
as the rest; being now settled in Italy, I reasoned and deliberated
greatly with myself, not whether I should continue in that sect,
into which I was sorry that I had fallen, but in what way I was to
find the truth, my sighs through love of which are known to no one
better than to yourself. Often it seemed to me that it could not be
found, and huge waves of my thoughts would roll toward deciding in
favor of the Academics. Often again, with what power I had, looking
into the human soul, with so much life, with so much intelligence,
with so much clearness, I thought that the truth lay not hid, save
that in it the way of search lay hid, and that this same way must
be taken from some divine authority. It remained to enquire what
was that authority, where in so great dissensions each promised
that he would deliver it. Thus there met me a wood, out of which
there was no way, which I was very loath to be involved in: and
amid these things, without any rest, my mind was agitated through
desire of finding the truth. However, I continued to unsew myself
more and more from those whom now I had proposed to leave. But
there remained nothing else, in so great dangers, than with words
full of tears and sorrow to entreat the Divine Providence to help
me. And this I was content to do: and now certain disputations of
the Bishop of Milan<note place="end" n="1733" id="iv.vi.xxi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxi-p3"> i.e. S. Ambrose. v. Conf. b. v.
c. xiii. xiv. &#167; 23, 24, 25</p></note> had almost moved me to desire, not
without some hope, to enquire into many things concerning the Old
Testament itself, which, as you know, we used to view as accursed,
having been ill commended to us. And I had decided to be a
Catechumen in the Church, unto which I had been delivered by my
parents, until such time as I should either find what I wished, or
should persuade myself that it needed not to be sought. Therefore
had there been one who could teach me, he would find me at a very
critical moment most fervently disposed and very apt to learn. If
you see that you too have been long affected in this way,
therefore, and with a like care for thy soul, and if now you seem
to yourself to have been tossed to and fro enough, and wish to put
an end to labors of this kind, follow the pathway of Catholic
teaching, which hath flowed down from Christ Himself through the
Apostles even unto us, and will hereafter flow down to
posterity.</p>

21. This, you will say, is
ridiculous, whereas all profess to hold and teach this: all
heretics make this profession, I cannot deny it; but so, as that
they promise to those whom they entice, that they will give them a
reason concerning matters the most obscure: and on this account
chiefly charge the Catholic [Church], that they who come to her are
enjoined to believe; but they make it their boast, that they impose
not a yoke of believing, but open a fount of teaching. You answer,
What could be said, that should pertain more to their praise? It is
not so. For this they do, without being endued with any strength,
but in order to conciliate to themselves a crowd by the name of
reason: on the promise of which the human soul naturally is
pleased, and, without considering its own 
<pb n="357" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_357.html" id="iv.vi.xxii-Page_357"/>strength and state of
health, by seeking the food of the sound, which is ill entrusted
save to such as are in health, rushes upon the poisons of them who
deceive. For true religion, unless those things be believed, which
each one after, if he shall conduct himself well and shall be
worthy, attains unto and understands, and altogether without a
certain weighty power of authority, can in no way be rightly
entered upon.</p>

22. But perhaps you seek to
have some reason given you on this very point, such as may persuade
you, that you ought not to be taught by reason before faith. Which
may easily be done, if only you make yourself a fair hearer. But,
in order that it may be done suitably, I wish you as it were to
answer my questions; and, first, to tell me, why you, think that
one ought not to believe. Because, you say, credulity, from which
men are called credulous, in itself, seems to me to be a certain
fault: otherwise we should not use to cast this as a term of
reproach. For if a suspicious man is in fault, in that he suspects
things not ascertained; how much more a credulous man, who herein
differs from a suspicious man, that the one allows some doubt, the
other none, in matters which he knows not. In the mean while I
accept this opinion and distinction. But you know that we are not
wont to call a person even curious without some reproach; but we
call him studious even with praise. Wherefore observe, if you
please, what seems to you to be the difference between these two.
This surely, you answer, that, although both be led by great desire
to know, yet the curious man seeks after things that no way pertain
to him, but the studious man, on the contrary, seeks after what
pertain to him. But, because we deny not that a man&#8217;s wife and
children, and their health, pertain unto him; if any one, being
settled abroad, were to be careful to ask all comers, how his wife
and children are and fare, he is surely led by great desire to
know, and yet we call not this man studious, who both exceedingly
wishes to know, and that (in) matters which very greatly pertain
unto him. Wherefore you now understand that the definition of a
studious person falters in this point, that every studious person
wishes to know what pertain to himself, and yet not every one, who
makes this his business, is to be called studious; but he who with
all earnestness seeks those things which pertain unto the liberal
culture and adornment of the mind. Yet we rightly call him one who
studies,<note place="end" n="1734" id="iv.vi.xxiii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxiii-p2"> <i>Studentem</i></p></note> especially
if we add what he studies to hear. For we may call him even
studious of his own (family) if he love only his own (family), we
do not however, without some addition, think him worthy of the
common name of the studious. But one who was desirous to hear how
his family were I should not call studious of hearing, unless
taking pleasure in the good report, he should wish to hear it again
and again: but one who studied, even if only once. Now return to
the curious person, and tell me, if any one should be willing to
listen to some tale, such as would no way profit him, that is, of
matters that pertain not to him: and that not in an offensive way
and frequently, but very seldom and with great moderation, either
at a feast, or in some company, or meeting of any kind; would he
seem to you curious? I think not: but at any rate he would
certainly seem to have a care for that matter, to which he was
willing to listen. Wherefore the definition of a curious person
also must be corrected by the same rule as that of a studious
person: Consider therefore whether the former statements also do
not need to be corrected. For why should not both he, who at some
time suspects something, be unworthy the name of a suspicious
person; and he who at some time believes something, of a credulous
person? Thus as there is very great difference between one who
studies any matter, and the absolutely studious; and again between
him who hath a care and the curious; so is there between him who
believes and the credulous.</p>

23. But you will say,
consider now whether we ought to believe in religion. For, although
we grant that it is one thing to believe, another to be credulous,
it does not follow that it is no fault to believe in matters of
religion. For what if it be a fault both to believe and to be
credulous, as (it is) both to be drunk and to be a drunkard? Now he
who thinks this certain, it seems to me can have no friend; for, if
it is base to believe any thing, either he acts basely who believes
a friend, or in nothing believing a friend I see not how he can
call either him or himself a friend. Here perhaps you may say, I
grant that we must believe something at some time; now make plain,
how in the case of religion it be not base to believe before one
knows. I will do so, if I can. Wherefore I ask of you, which you
esteem the graver fault, to deliver religion to one unworthy, or to
believe what is said by them who deliver it. If you understand not
whom I call unworthy, I call him, who approaches with feigned
breast. You grant, as I suppose, that it is more blameable to
unfold unto such an one whatever holy secrets there are, than to
believe religious <pb n="358" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_358.html" id="iv.vi.xxiv-Page_358"/>men affirming any thing on the
matter of religion itself. For it would be unbecoming you to make
any other answer. Wherefore now suppose him present, who is about
to deliver to you a religion, in what way shall you assure him,
that you approach with a true mind, and that, so far as this matter
is concerned, there is in you no fraud or feigning? You will say,
your own good conscience that you are no way feigning, asserting
this with words as strong as you can, but yet with words. For you
cannot lay open man to man the hiding places of your soul, so that
you may be thoroughly known. But if he shall say, Lo, I believe
you, but is it not more fair that you also believe me, when, if I
hold any truth, you are about to receive, I about to give, a
benefit? what will you answer, save that you must
believe.</p>

24. But you say, Were it not
better that you should give me a reason, that, wherever, that shall
lead me, I may follow without any rashness? Perhaps it were: but,
it being so great a matter, that you are by reason to come to the
knowledge of God, do you think that all are qualified to understand
the reasons, by which the human soul is led to know God, or many,
or few? Few I think, you say. Do you believe that you are in the
number of these? It is not for me, you say, to answer this.
Therefore you think it is for him to believe you in this also: and
this indeed he does: only do you remember, that he hath already
twice believed you saying things uncertain; that you are unwilling
to believe him even once admonishing you in a religious spirit. But
suppose that it is so, and that you approach with a true mind to
receive religion, and that you are one of few men in such sense as
to be able to take in the reasons by which the Divine Power<note place="end" n="1735" id="iv.vi.xxv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxv-p2"> <i>Vis divina</i></p></note> is brought
into certain knowledge; what? do you think that other men, who are
not endued with so serene a disposition, are to be denied religion?
or do you think that they are to be led gradually by certain steps
unto those highest inner recesses? You see clearly which is the
more religious. For you cannot think that any one whatever in a
case where he desires so great a thing, ought by any means to be
abandoned or rejected. But do you not think, that, unless he do
first believe that he shall attain unto that which he purposes; and
do yield his mind as a suppliant; and, submitting to certain great
and necessary precepts, do by a certain course of life thoroughly
cleanse it, that he will not otherwise attain the things that are
purely true? Certainly you think so. What, then, is the case of
those, (of whom I already believe you to be one,) who are able most
easily to receive divine secrets by sure reason, will it, I ask, be
to them any hindrance at all, if they so come as they who at the
first believe? I think not. But yet, you say, what need to delay
them? Because although they will in no way harm themselves by what
is done, yet they will harm the rest by the precedent. For there is
hardly one who has a just notion of his own power: but he who has a
less notion must be roused; he who has a greater notion must be
checked: that neither the one be broken by despair, nor the other
carried headlong by rashness. And this is easily done, if even
they, who are able to fly, (that they be not alluring the occasion
of any into danger,) are forced for a short time to walk where the
rest also may walk with safety. This is the forethought of true
religion: this the command of God: this what hath been handed down
from our blessed forefathers, this what hath been preserved even
unto us: to wish to distrust and overthrow this, is nothing else
than to seek a sacrilegious way unto true religion. And whoso do
this, not even if what they wish be granted to them are they able
to arrive at the point at which they aim. For whatever kind of
excellent genius they have, unless God be present, they creep on
the ground. But He is then present, if they, who are aiming at God,
have a regard for their fellow men. Than which step there can be
found nothing more sure Heavenward. I for my part cannot resist
this reasoning, for how can I say that we are to believe nothing
without certain knowledge? whereas both there can be no friendship
at all, unless there be believed something which cannot be proved
by some reason, and often stewards, who are slaves, are trusted by
their masters without any fault on their part. But in religion what
can there be more unfair than that the ministers<note place="end" n="1736" id="iv.vi.xxv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxv-p3"> <i>Antistites</i></p></note> of God believe us when we promise
an unfeigned mind, and we are unwilling to believe them when they
enjoin us any thing. Lastly, what way can there be more healthful,
than for a man to become fitted to receive the truth by believing
those things, which have been appointed by God to serve for the
previous culture and treatment of the mind? Or, if you be already
altogether fitted, rather to make some little circuit where it is
safest to tread, than both to cause yourself danger, and to be a
precedent for rashness to other men?</p>

to consider, in what manner we ought not to follow these,
<pb n="359" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_359.html" id="iv.vi.xxvi-Page_359"/>who
profess that they will lead by reason. For how we may without fault
follow those who bid us to believe, hath been already said: but
unto these who make promises of reason certain think that they
come, not only without blame, but also with some praise: but it is
not so. For there are two (classes of) persons, praiseworthy in
religion; one of those who have already found, whom also we must
needs judge most blessed; another of those who are seeking with all
earnestness and in the right way. The first, therefore, are already
in very possession, the other on the way, yet on that way whereby
they are most sure to arrive.<note place="end" n="1737" id="iv.vi.xxvi-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxvi-p2"> cf. <i>Retract.</i> b. i. ch.
xiv. 2. &#8220;I also said, &#8216;For there are two &amp;c.&#8217; In these
words of mine if &#8216;those who have already found&#8217; whom we have
said to be &#8216;now in possession,&#8217; are in such sort understood to
be &#8216;most happy,&#8217; as that they are so not in this life, but in
that we hope for, and aim at by the path of faith, the meaning is
free from error: for they are to be judged to have found that which
is to be sought, who are now there, whither we by seeking and
believing, that is by keeping the path of faith, do seek to come.
But if they are thought to be or to have been such in this life
that seems to me not to be true: not that in this life no truth at
all can be found that can be discerned by the mind, not believed on
faith; but because it is but so much, what there is of it, as not

12</scripRef>), incapable of being discerned by the mind. It is
discerned, clearly, but does not yet make us most blessed. For that
makes men most blessed which he saith, <i>but then face to
face</i>, and, <i>then I shall know even as I am known</i>. They
that have found this, they are to be said to stand in possession of
bliss, to which leads that path of faith which we keep, and whither
we desire to arrive at by believing. But who are those most
blessed, who are already in that possession whither this path
leads, is a great question. And for the holy Angels indeed, there
is no question but they be there. But of holy men already departed,
whether so much may yet be said of them as that they stand already
in that possession, is fairly made a question. For they are already
freed from the corruptible body that weigheth down the soul
(<scripRef passage="Wisd. 9" id="iv.vi.xxvi-p2.4" parsed="|Wis|9|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.9">Wisd. 9</scripRef>.), but they
still wait for the redemption of their body (<scripRef passage="Rom. 8" id="iv.vi.xxvi-p2.6" parsed="|Rom|8|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8">Rom. 8</scripRef>.), and their
flesh resteth in hope, nor is yet glorified in the incorruption
that is to come. (<scripRef passage="Ps. 16" id="iv.vi.xxvi-p2.8" parsed="|Ps|16|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.16">Ps. 16</scripRef>.) But whether
for all that they are none the less qualified to contemplate the
truth with the eyes of the heart, as it is said, <i>Face to
face</i>, there is not space to discuss here.&#8221;</p></note> There are three other kinds of men
altogether to be disapproved of and detested. One is of those who
hold an opinion,<note place="end" n="1738" id="iv.vi.xxvi-p2.9"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxvi-p3"> <i>Opinantium</i></p></note> that is, of those who think that
they know what they know not. Another is of those who are indeed
aware that they know not, but do not so seek as to be able to find.
A third is of those who neither think that they know, nor wish to
seek. There are also three things, as it were bordering upon one
another, in the minds of men well worth distinguishing;
understanding, belief, opinion. And, if these be considered by
themselves, the first is always without fault, the second sometimes
with fault, the third never without fault. For the understanding of
matters great, and honorable, and even divine, is most blessed.<note place="end" n="1739" id="iv.vi.xxvi-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxvi-p4"> cf. <i>Retract.</i> b. i. ch. 14.
2. &#8220;Also what I said, &#8216;for to know great and noble and even
divine things,&#8217; we should refer to the same blessedness. For in
this life whatsoever there be of it known amounts not to perfect
bliss, because that part of it which remains unknown is far more
without all comparison.&#8221;</p></note> But the
understanding of things unnecessary is no injury; but perhaps the
learning was an injury, in that it took up the time of necessary
matters. But on the matters themselves that are injurious, it is
not the understanding, but the doing or suffering them, that is
wretched. For not, in case any understand how an enemy may be slain
without danger to himself, is he guilty from the mere
understanding, not the wish; and, if the wish be absent, what can
be called more innocent? But belief is then worthy of blame, when
either any thing is believed of God which is unworthy of Him, or
any thing is over easily believed of man. But in all other matters
if any believe aught, provided he understand that he knows it not,
there is no fault. For I believe that very wicked conspirators were
formerly put to death by the virtue of Cicero; but this I not only
know not, but also I know for certain that I can by no means know.
But opinion is on two accounts very base; in that both he who hath
persuaded himself that he already knows, cannot learn; provided
only it may be learnt; and in itself rashness is a sign of a mind
not well disposed. For even if any suppose that he know what I said
of Cicero, (although it be no hindrance to him from learning, in
that the matter itself is incapable of being grasped by any
knowledge;) yet, (in that he understands not that there is a great
difference, whether any thing be grasped by sure reason of mind,
which we call understanding, or whether for practical purposes it
be entrusted to common fame or writing, for posterity to believe
it,) he assuredly errs, and no error is without what is base. What
then we understand, we owe to reason; what we believe, to
authority; what we have an opinion on, to error.<note place="end" n="1740" id="iv.vi.xxvi-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxvi-p5"> cf. <i>Retract.</i> b. i. ch.
xiv. 3. &#8220;And what I said &#8216;that there is a great difference
whether anything be grasped by sure reason of mind, which we call
knowing, or whether for practical purposes it be entrusted to
common fame or writing, for posterity to believe it,&#8217; and
presently after, &#8216;what therefore we know, we owe to reason; what
we believe to authority;&#8217; is not to be so taken as that in
conversation we should fear to say we &#8216;know&#8217; what we believe of
suitable witnesses. For when we speak strictly we are said to know
that only which by the mind&#8217;s own firm reason we comprehend. But
when we speak in words more suited to common use, as also Divine
Scripture speaketh, we should not hesitate to say we know both what
we have perceived with our bodily senses, and what we believe of
trustworthy witnesses, whilst however between one and the other we
are aware what difference exists.&#8221;</p></note> But every one who understands also
believes, and also every one who has an opinion believes; not every
one who believes understands, no one who has an opinion
understands. Therefore if these three things be referred unto the
five kinds of men, which we mentioned a little above; that is, two
kinds to be approved, which we set first, and three that remain
faulty; we find that the first kind, that of the blessed, believe
the truth itself; but the second kind, that of such as are earnest
after, and lovers of, the truth, believe authority. In which kinds,
of the two, the act of belief is praiseworthy. But in the first of
the faulty <pb n="360" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_360.html" id="iv.vi.xxvi-Page_360"/>kinds, that is, of those who have an opinion that they
know what they know not, there is an altogether faulty credulity.
The other two kinds that are to be disapproved believe nothing,
both they who seek the truth despairing of finding it, and they who
seek it not at all. And this only in matters which pertain unto any
system of teaching. For in the other business of life, I am utterly
ignorant by what means a man can believe nothing. Although in the
case of those also they who say that in practical matters they
follow probabilities, would seem rather to be unable to know than
unable to believe. For who believes not what he approves?<note place="end" n="1741" id="iv.vi.xxvi-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxvi-p6"> <i>Probat</i></p></note> or how is
what they follow probable, if it be not approved? Wherefore there
may be two kinds of such as oppose the truth: one of those who
assail knowledge alone, not faith; the other of those who condemn
both: and yet again, I am ignorant whether these can be found in
matters of human life. These things have been said, in order that
we might understand, that, in retaining faith, even of those things
which as yet we comprehend not, we are set free from the rashness
of such as have an opinion. For they, who say that we are to
believe nothing but what we know, are on their guard against that
one name &#8220;opining,&#8221;<note place="end" n="1742" id="iv.vi.xxvi-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxvi-p7"> <i>Opinationis</i></p></note> which must be confessed to be base
and very wretched, but, if they consider carefully that there is a
very great difference, whether one think that he knows, or moved by
some authority believe that which he understands that he knows not,
surely he will escape the charge of error, and inhumanity, and
pride.</p>

26. For I ask, if what is not
known must not be believed, in what way may children do service to
their parents, and love with mutual affection those whom they
believe not to be their parents? For it cannot, by any means, be
known by reason. But the authority of the mother comes in, that it
be believed of the father; but of the mother it is usually not the
mother that is believed, but midwives, nurses, servants. For she,
from whom a son may be stolen and another put in his place, may she
not being deceived deceive? Yet we believe, and believe without any
doubt, what we confess we cannot know. For who but must see, that
unless it be so, filial affection, the most sacred bond of the
human race, is violated by extreme pride of wickedness? For what
madman even would think him to be blamed who discharged the duties
that were due to those whom he believed to be his parents, although
they were not so? Who, on the other hand, would not judge him to
deserve banishment, who failed to love those who were perhaps his
true parents, through fear lest he should love pretended. Many
things may be alleged, whereby to show that nothing at all of human
society remains safe, if we shall determine to believe nothing,
which we cannot grasp by full apprehension.<note place="end" n="1743" id="iv.vi.xxvii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxvii-p2"> <i>Tenere

27. But now hear, what I
trust I shall by this time more easily persuade you of. In a matter
of religion, that is, of the worship and knowledge of God, they are
less to be followed, who forbid us to believe, making most ready
professions of reason. For no one doubts that all men are either
fools or wise.<note place="end" n="1744" id="iv.vi.xxviii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxviii-p2"> cf. <i>Retract.</i> b. i. ch. 14.
4. &#8220;Also what I said, &#8216;No one doubts that all men are either
fools or wise,&#8217; may seem contrary to what is read in my third
book <i>On Free Will,</i> (c. 24.) &#8216;as though human nature
admitted of no middle state between folly and wisdom.&#8217; But that
is said when the question was about the first man, whether he was
made wise, or foolish, or neither: since we could in no wise call
him foolish, who was made without fault, since folly is a great
fault, and how we could call him wise, who was capable of being led
astray, did not appear. So for shortness I thought well to say,
&#8216;as though human nature admitted of no middle state between folly
and wisdom.&#8217; I also had infants in view, whom though we confess
to bear with them original sin, yet we cannot properly call either
wise or foolish, not as yet using free will either well or ill. But
now I said that men were either wise or foolish, meaning those to
be understood who are already using reason, by which they are
distinguished from cattle, so as to be men; as we say that &#8216;all
men wish to be happy.&#8217; For can we in so true and manifest a
statement be in fear of being supposed to mean infants, who have
not yet the power of so wishing?&#8221;</p></note> But now I
call wise, not clever and gifted men, but those, in whom there is,
so much as may be in man, the knowledge of man himself and of God
most surely received, and a life and manners suitable to that
knowledge; but all others, whatever be their skill or want of
skill, whatever their manner of life, whether to be approved or
disapproved, I would account in the number of fools. And, this
being so, who of moderate understanding but will clearly see, that
it is more useful and more healthful for fools to obey the precepts
of the wise, than to live by their own judgment? For everything
that is done, if it be not rightly done, is a sin, nor can that any
how be rightly done which proceeds not from right reason. Further,
right reason is very virtue. But to whom of men is virtue at hand,
save to the mind of the wise? Therefore the wise man alone sins
not. Therefore every fool sins, save in those actions, in which he
hath obeyed a wise man: for all such actions proceed from right
reason, and, so to say, the fool is not to be accounted master of
his own action, he being, as it were, the instrument and that which
ministers<note place="end" n="1745" id="iv.vi.xxviii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxviii-p3"> <i>Ministerium</i></p></note> to the
wise man. Wherefore, if it be better for all men not to sin than to
sin; assuredly all fools would live better, if they could be slaves
of the wise. And, if no one doubts that this is better in lesser
matters, as in buying and selling, and cultivating the ground, in
taking <pb n="361" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_361.html" id="iv.vi.xxviii-Page_361"/>a wife, in undertaking and bringing<note place="end" n="1746" id="iv.vi.xxviii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxviii-p4"> <i>Or
&#8220;begetting,&#8221;&#8212;suscipiendis</i></p></note> up children, lastly, in the
management of household property, much more in religion. For both
human matters are more easy to distinguish between, than divine;
and in all matters of greater sacredness and excellence, the
greater obedience and service we owe them, the more wicked and the
more dangerous is it to sin. Therefore you see henceforth<note place="end" n="1747" id="iv.vi.xxviii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxviii-p5"> <i>Ben. ed.&#8212;a modo. Mss.
admodum</i></p></note> that
nothing else is left us, so long as we are fools, if our heart be
set on an excellent and religious life, but to seek wise men, by
obeying whom we may be enabled both to lessen the great feeling of
the rule of folly, whilst it is in us, and at the last to escape
from it.</p>

28. Here again arises a very
difficult question. For in what way shall we fools be able to find
a wise man, whereas this name, although hardly any one dare openly,
yet most men lay claim to indirectly: so disagreeing one with
another in the very matters, in the knowledge of which wisdom
consists, as that it must needs be that either none of them, or but
some certain one be wise? But when the fool enquires, who is that
wise man? I do not at all see, in what way he can be distinguished
and perceived. For by no signs whatever can one recognize any
thing, unless he shall have known that thing, whereof these are
signs. But the fool is ignorant of wisdom. For not, as, in the case
of gold and silver and other things of that kind, it is allowed
both to know them when you see them and not to have them, thus may
wisdom be seen by the mind&#8217;s eye of him who hath it not. For
whatever things we come into contact with by bodily sense, are
presented to us from without; and therefore we may perceive by the
eyes what belong to others, when we ourselves possess not any of
them or of that kind. But what is perceived by the understanding is
within in the mind, and to have it is nothing else than to see. But
the fool is void of wisdom, therefore he knows not wisdom. For he
could not see it with the eyes: but he cannot see it and not have
it, nor have it and be a fool. Therefore he knoweth it not, and, so
long as he knoweth it not, he cannot recognize it in another place.
No one, so long as he is a fool, can by most sure knowledge find
out a wise man, by obeying whom he may be set free from so great
evil of folly.</p>

29. Therefore this so vast
difficulty, since our enquiry is about religion, God alone can
remedy: nor indeed, unless we believe both that He is, and that He
helps men&#8217;s minds, ought we even to enquire after true religion
itself. For what I ask do we with so great endeavor desire to
search out? What do we wish to attain unto? Whither do we long to
arrive? Is it at that which we believe not exists or pertains to
us? Nothing is more perverse than such a state of mind. Then, when
you would not dare to ask of me a kindness, or at any rate would be
shameless in daring, come you to demand the discovery of religion,
when you think that God neither exists, nor, if He exist, hath any
care for us? What, if it be so great a matter, as that it cannot be
found out, unless it be sought carefully and with all our might?
What, if the very extreme difficulty of discovery be an exercise
for the mind of the inquirer, in order to receive what shall be
discovered? For what more pleasant and familiar to our eyes than
this light? And yet men are unable after long darkness to hear and
endure it. What more suited to the body exhausted by sickness than
meat and drink? And yet we see that persons who are recovering are
restrained and checked, lest they dare to commit themselves to the
fullness of persons in health, and so bring to pass by means of
their very food their return to that disease which used to reject
it. I speak of persons who are recovering. What, the very sick, do
we not urge them to take something? Wherein assuredly they would
not with so great discomfort obey us, if they believed not that
they would recover from that disease. When then will you give
yourself up to a search very full of pains and labor? When will you
have the heart to impose upon yourself so great care and trouble as
the matter deserves, when you believe not in the existence of that
which you are in search of? Rightly therefore hath it been ordained
by the majesty of the Catholic system of teaching, that they who
approach unto religion be before all things persuaded to have
faith.</p>

Christians,) I ask you, what reason he alleges to me? What is there
whereby for him to call me back from believing, as if from

very true religion hath any existence in human affairs; and what I
believe not to exist, I seek not. But He, as I suppose, will show

31. What, that
all heretics exhort us to believe in Christ? Can they possibly be
more opposed to themselves? And in this matter they are to be
pressed in a twofold way. In the first place we must ask of them,
where is the reason which they used to promise, where the reproof
of rashness, where the assumption of knowledge? For, if it be
disgraceful to believe any without reason, what do you wait for,
what are you busied about, that I believe some one without reason,
in order that I may the more easily be led by your reason? What,
will your reason raise any firm superstructure on the foundation of
rashness? I speak after their manner, whom we displease by
believing. For I not only judge it most healthful to believe before
reason, when you are not qualified to receive reason, and by the
very act of faith thoroughly to cultivate the mind to receive the
seeds of truth, but altogether a thing of such sort as that without
it health cannot return to sick souls. And in that this seems to
them matter for mockery and full of rashness, surely they are
shameless in making it their business that we believe in Christ.
Next, I confess that I have already believed in Christ, and have
convinced myself that what He hath said is true, although it be
supported by no reason; is this, heretic, what you will teach me in
the first place? Suffer me to consider a little with myself, (since
I have not seen Christ Himself, as He willed to appear unto men,
Who is said to have been seen by them, even by common eyes,) who
they are that I have believed concerning Him, in order that I may
approach you already furnished beforehand with such a faith. I see
that there are none that I have believed, save the confirmed
opinion and widely extended report of peoples and nations: and that
the mysteries of the Church Catholic have in all times and places
had possession of these peoples. Why therefore shall I not of
these, in preference to others, inquire with all care, what Christ
commanded, by whose authority I have been moved already to believe
that Christ hath commanded something that is profitable? Are you
likely to be a better expounder to me of what He said, Whose past
or present existence I should not believe, if by you I were to be
recommended to believe thus? This therefore I have believed, as I
said, trusting to report strengthened by numbers, agreement,
antiquity. But you, who are both so few, and so turbulent, and so
new, no one doubts that ye bring forward nothing worthy of
authority. What then is that so great madness? Believe them, that
you are to believe in Christ, and learn from us what He said. Why,
I pray you? For were they to fail and to be unable to teach me any
thing with much greater ease could I persuade my self, that I am
not to believe in Christ, than that I am to learn any thing
concerning Him, save from those through whom I had believed in Him.
O vast confidence, or rather absurdity! I teach you what Christ, in
Whom you believe, commanded. What, in case I believed not in Him?
You could not, could you, teach me any thing concerning Him? But,
says he, it behoves you to believe. You do not mean, do you, that I
am (to believe) you when you commend Him to my faith? No, saith he,
for we lead by reason them who believe in Him. Why then should I
believe in Him? Because report hath been grounded. Whether is it
through you, or through others? Through others, saith he. Shall I
then believe them, in order that you may teach me? Perhaps I ought
to do so, were it not that they gave me this chief charge, that I
should not approach you at all; for they say that you have deadly
doctrines. You will answer, They lie. How then shall I believe them
concerning Christ, Whom they have not seen, (and) not believe them
concerning you, whom they are unwilling to see? Believe the
Scriptures, saith he. But every writing,<note place="end" n="1749" id="iv.vi.xxxii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxxii-p2"> <i>Scriptur&#230;</i></p></note> if it be brought forward new and
unheard of, or be commended by few, with no reason to confirm it,
it is not it that is believed, but they who bring it forward.
Wherefore, for those Scriptures, if you are they who bring them
forward, you so few and unknown, I am not pleased to believe them.
At the same time also you are acting contrary to your promise, in
enforcing faith rather than giving a reason. You will recall me
again to numbers and (common) report. Curb, I pray you, your
obstinacy, and that untamed lust, I know not what, of spreading
your name: and advise me rather to seek the chief men of this
multitude, and to seek with all care and pains rather to learn
something concerning these writings from these men, but for whose
existence, I should not know that I had to learn at all. But do you
return into your dens, and lay not any snares under the name of
truth, which you endeavor to take from those, to whom you yourself
grant authority.</p>

deceitfully, but also the inveterate error of the nations opposing
with violence, should be unable on any side to rend it
asunder.</p>

33. Wherefore, although I am
not able to teach, yet I cease not to advise, that, (whereas many
wish to appear wise, and it is no easy matter to discern whether
they be fools,) with all earnestness, and with all prayers, and
lastly with groans, or even, if so it may be, with tears, you
entreat of God to set you free from the evil of error; if your
heart be set on a happy life. And this will take place the more
easily, if you obey with a willing mind His commands, which He hath
willed should be confirmed by so great authority of the Catholic
Church. For whereas the wise man is so joined to God in mind, as
that there is nothing set between to separate; for God is Truth;
and no one is by any means wise, unless his mind come into contact
with the Truth; we cannot deny that between the folly of man, and
the most pure Truth of God, the wisdom of man is set, as something
in the middle. For the wise man, so far as it is given unto him,
imitates God; but for a man who is a fool, there is nothing nearer
to him, than a man who is wise, for him to imitate with profit: and
since, as has been said, it is not easy to understand this one by
reason, it behoved that certain miracles be brought near to the
very eyes, which fools use with much greater readiness than the
mind, that, men being moved by authority, their life and habits
might first be cleansed, and they thus rendered capable of
receiving reason. Whereas, therefore, it needed both that man be
imitated, and that our hope be not set in man, what could be done
on the part of God more full of kindness and grace, than that the
very pure, eternal, unchangeable Wisdom of God, unto Whom it
behoves us to cleave, should deign to take upon Him (the nature of)
man? That not only He might do what should invite us to follow God,
but also might suffer what used to deter us from following God.
For, whereas no one can attain unto the most sure and chief good,
unless he shall fully and perfectly love it; which will by no means
take place, so long as the evils of the body and of fortune are
dreaded; He by being born after a miraculous manner and working
caused Himself to be loved; and by dying and rising again shut out
fear. And, further, in all other matters, which it were long to go
through, He shewed Himself such, as that we might perceive unto
what the clemency of God could be reached forth, and unto what the
weakness of man be lifted up.</p>

34. This is, believe me, a
most wholesome authority, this a lifting up first of our mind from
dwelling on the earth, this a turning from the love of this world
unto the True God. It is authority alone which moves fools to
hasten unto wisdom. So long as we cannot understand pure (truths),
it is indeed wretched to be deceived by authority, but surely more
wretched not to be moved. For, if the Providence of God preside not
over human affairs, we have no need to busy ourselves about
religion. But if both the outward form of all things, which we must
believe assuredly flows from some fountain of truest beauty, and
some, I know not what, inward conscience exhorts, as it were, in
public and in private, all the better order of minds to seek God,
and to serve God; we must not give up all hope that the same God
Himself hath appointed some authority, whereon, resting as on a
sure step, we may be lifted up unto God. But this, setting aside
reason, which (as we have often said) it is very hard for fools to
understand pure, moves us two ways; in part by miracles, in part
by <pb n="364" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_364.html" id="iv.vi.xxxv-Page_364"/>multitude of followers: no one of these is necessary to
the wise man; who denies it? But this is now the business in hand,
that we may be able to be wise, that is, to cleave to the truth;
which the filthy soul is utterly unable to do: but the filth of the
soul, to say shortly what I mean, is the love of any things
whatsoever save God and the soul: from which filth the more any one
is cleansed, the more easily he sees the truth. Therefore to wish
to see the truth, in order to purge your soul, when as it is purged
for the very purpose that you may see, is surely perverse and
preposterous. Therefore to man unable to see the truth, authority
is at hand, in order that he may be made fitted for it, and may
allow himself to be cleansed; and, as I said a little above, no one
doubts that this prevails, in part by miracles, in part by
multitude. But I call that a miracle, whatever appears that is
difficult or unusual above the hope or power of them who wonder. Of
which kind there is nothing more suited for the people, and in
general for foolish men, than what is brought near to the senses.
But these, again, are divided into two kinds; for there are
certain, which cause only wonder, but certain others procure also
great favor and good-will. For, if one were to see a man flying,
inasmuch as that matter brings no advantage to the spectator,
beside the spectacle itself, he only wonders. But if any affected
with grievous and hopeless disease were to recover straightway,
upon being bidden, his affection for him who heals, will go beyond
even his wonder at his healing. Such were done at that time at
which God in True Man appeared unto men, as much as was enough. The
sick were healed, the lepers were cleansed; walking was restored to
the lame, sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf. The men of that
time saw water turned into wine, five thousand filled with five
loaves, seas passed on foot, dead rising again: thus certain
provided for the good of the body by more open benefit, certain
again for the good of the soul by more hidden sign, and all for the
good of men by their witness to Majesty: thus, at that time, was
the divine authority moving towards Itself the wandering souls of
mortal men. Why, say you, do not those things take place now?
because they would not move, unless they were wonderful, and, if
they were usual, they would not be wonderful.<note place="end" n="1754" id="iv.vi.xxxv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxxv-p2"> cf. <i>Retract.</i> b. i. c. 14.
5. &#8220;In another place, where I had made mention of the miracles,
which our Lord Jesus did, while He was here in the Flesh, I added,
saying, &#8216;Why, say you, do not those things take place now?&#8217; and
I answered, &#8216;Because they would not move unless they were
wonderful, and if they were usual they would not be wonderful.&#8217;
But this I said because not so great miracles, nor all take place
now, not because there are none wrought even now.&#8221;</p></note> For the interchanges of day and
night, and the settled order of things in Heaven, the revolution of
years divided into four parts, the fall and return of leaves to
trees, the boundless power of seeds, the beauty of light, the
varieties of colors, sounds, tastes, and scents, let there be some
one who shall see and perceive them for the first time, and yet
such an one as we may converse with; he is stupified and
overwhelmed with miracles: but we contemn all these, not because
they are easy to understand, (for what more obscure than the causes
of these?) but surely because they constantly meet our senses.
Therefore they were done at a very suitable time, in order that, by
these a multitude of believers having been gathered together and
spread abroad, authority might be turned with effect upon
habits.</p>

35. But any habits whatever
have so great power to hold possession of men&#8217;s minds, that even
what in them are evil, which usually takes place through excess of
lusts, we can sooner disapprove of and hate, than desert or change.
Do you think that little hath been done for the benefit of man,
that not some few very learned men maintain by argument, but also
an unlearned crowd of males and females in so many and different
nations both believe and set forth, that we are to worship as God
nothing of earth, nothing of fire, nothing, lastly, which comes
into contact with the senses of the body, but that we are to seek
to approach Him by the understanding only? that abstinence is
extended even unto the slenderest food of bread and water, and
fastings not only for the day,<note place="end" n="1755" id="iv.vi.xxxvi-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxxvi-p2"> <i>Quotidiana</i>, i.e. each day till evening.</p></note> but also continued through several
days together; that chastity is carried even unto the contempt of
marriage and family; that patience even unto the setting light by
crosses and flames; that liberality even unto the distribution of
estates unto the poor; that, lastly, the contempt of this whole
world even unto the desire of death? Few do these things, yet fewer
do them well and wisely: but whole nations approve, nations hear,
nations favor, nations, lastly, love. Nations accuse their own
weakness that they cannot do these things, and that not without the
mind being carried forward unto God, nor without certain sparks of
virtue. This hath been brought to pass by the Divine Providence,
through the prophecies of the Prophets, through the manhood and
teaching of Christ, through the journeys of the Apostles, through
the insults, crosses, blood, of the Martyrs, through the
praiseworthy life of the Saints, and, in all these, <pb n="365" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_365.html" id="iv.vi.xxxvi-Page_365"/>according as
times were seasonable, through miracles worthy of so great matters

36. Wherefore, if either our
reasoning or our discourse hath in any way moved you, and if you
have, as I believe, a true care for yourself, I would you would
listen to me, and with pious faith, lively hope, and simple
charity, entrust yourself to good teachers of Catholic
Christianity; and cease not to pray unto God Himself, by Whose
goodness alone we were created, and suffer punishment by His
justice, and are set free by His mercy. Thus there will be wanting
to you neither precepts and treatises of most learned and truly
Christian men, nor books, nor calm thoughts themselves, whereby you
may easily find what you are seeking. For do you abandon utterly
those wordy and wretched men, (for what other milder name can I
use?) who, whilst they seek to excess whence is evil, find nothing
but evil. And on this question they often rouse their hearers to
inquire; but after that they have been roused, they teach them such
lessons as that it were preferable even to sleep for ever, than
than thus to be awake. For in place of lethargic they make them
frantic, between which diseases, both being usually fatal, there is
still this difference, that lethargic persons die without doing
violence to others; but the frantic person many who are sound, and
specially they who wish to help him, have reason to fear. For
neither is God the author of evil, nor hath it ever repented Him
that He hath done aught, nor is He troubled by storm of any passion
of soul, nor is a small part of earth His Kingdom: He neither
approves nor commands any sins or wickedness, He never lies. For
these and such like used to move us, when they used them to make
great and threatening assaults, and charged this as being the
system of teaching of the Old Testament, which is most false. Thus
then I allow that they do right in censuring these. What then have
I learnt? What think you, save that, when these are censured, the
Catholic system of teaching is not censured. Thus what I had learnt
among them that is true, I hold, what is false that I had thought I
reject. But the Catholic Church hath taught me many other things
also, which those men of bloodless bodies, but coarse minds, cannot
aspire unto; that is to say, that God is not corporeal, that no
part of Him can be perceived by corporeal eyes, that nothing of His
Substance or Nature can any way suffer violence or change, or is
compounded or formed; and if you grant me these, (for we may not
think otherwise concerning God,) all their devices are overthrown.
But how it is, that neither God begot or created evil, nor yet is
there, or hath there been ever, any nature and substance, which God
either begot not or created not, and yet that He setteth us free
from evil, is proved by reasons so necessary, that it cannot at all
be matter of doubt; especially to you and such as you; that is, if
to a good disposition there be added piety and a certain peace of
mind, without which nothing at all can be understood concerning so
great matters. And here there is no rumor concerning smoke, and I
know not what Persian vain fable, unto which it is enough to lend
an ear, and soul not subtile, but absolutely childish. Far
altogether, far otherwise is the truth, than as the Manichees dote.
But since this discourse of ours hath gone much further than I
thought, here let us end the book; in which I wish you to remember,
that I have not yet begun to refute the Manichees, and that I have
not yet assailed that nonsense; and that neither have I unfolded
any thing great concerning the Catholic Church itself, but that I
have only wished to root out of you, if I could, a false notion
concerning true Christians that was maliciously or ignorantly
suggested to us, and to arouse you to learn certain great and
divine things. Wherefore let this volume be as it is; but when your
soul becomes more <pb n="366" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_366.html" id="iv.vi.xxxvii-Page_366"/>calmed, I shall perhaps be more
ready in what remains.<note place="end" n="1761" id="iv.vi.xxxvii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vi.xxxvii-p2"> cf. <i>Retr.</i> b. i. ch. 14. 6.
&#8220;But in the end of the book I say, &#8216;But since this discourse of
ours, &amp;c.&#8217; This I did not say in such sort as though I had
not hitherto written anything against the Manich&#230;ans, or had not
committed to writing anything at all about Catholic doctrine, when
so many volumes before published were witnesses that I had not been
silent on either subject; but in this book written to him I had not
yet begun to refute the Manich&#230;ans, and had not yet attacked those
follies, nor had I as yet opened anything great concerning the
Catholic Church itself; because I hoped that after that beginning
made, I should write to that same person what I had not yet here
written.&#8221;</p></note></p>

things that He cannot do, and yet is Almighty! yea therefore is
Almighty, because He cannot do these things. For if He could die,
He were not Almighty; if to lie, if to be deceived, if to do
unjustly, were possible for Him, He were not Almighty: because if
this were in Him, He should not be worthy to be Almighty. To our
Almighty Father, it is quite impossible to sin. He does whatsoever
He will: that is Omnipotence. He does whatsoever He rightly will,
whatsoever He justly will: but whatsoever is evil to do, He wills
not. There is no resisting one who is Almighty, that He should not
do what He will. It was He Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and
all that in them is, invisible and visible. Invisible such as are
in heaven, thrones, dominions, principalities, powers, archangels,
angels: all, if we shall live aright, our fellow-citizens. He made
in heaven the things visible; the sun, the moon, the stars. With
its terrestrial animals He adorned the earth, filled the air with
things that fly, the land with them that walk and creep, the sea
with them that swim: all He filled with their own proper creatures.
He made also man after His own image and likeness, in the mind: for
in that is the image of God. This is the reason why the mind cannot
be comprehended even by itself, because in it is the image of God.
To this end were we made, that over the other creatures we should
bear rule: but through sin in the first man we fell, and are all
come into an inheritance of death. We were brought low, became
mortal, were filled with fears, with errors: this by desert of sin:

3. For this reason we believe
also in His Son, that is to say, God the Father Almighty&#8217;s,
&#8220;His Only Son, our Lord.&#8221; When thou hearest of the Only Son of
God, acknowledge Him God. For it could not be that God&#8217;s Only Son
should not be God. What He is, the same did He beget, though He is
not that Person Whom He begot. If He be truly Son, He is that which
the Father is; if He be not that which the Father is, He is not
truly Son. Observe mortal and earthly creatures: what each is, that
it engendereth. Man besets not an ox, sheep besets not dog, nor dog
sheep. Whatever it be that begetteth, that which it is, it
begetteth. Hold ye therefore boldly, firmly, faithfully, that the
Begotten of God the Father is what Himself is, Almighty. These
mortal creatures engender by corruption. Does God so beget? He that
is begotten mortal generates that which himself is; the Immortal
generates what He is: corruptible begets corruptible, Incorruptible
begets Incorruptible: the corruptible begets corruptibly,
Incorruptible, Incorruptibly: yea, so begetteth what Itself is,
that One begets One, and therefore Only. Ye know, that when I
pronounced to you the Creed, so I said, and so ye are bounden to
believe; that we &#8220;believe in God the Father Almighty, and in
Jesus Christ His Only Son.&#8221; Here too, when thou believest that He
is the Only, believe Him Almighty: for it is not to be thought that
God the Father does what He will, and God the Son does not what He
will. One Will of Father and Son, because one Nature. For it is
impossible for the will of the Son to be any whit parted from the
Father&#8217;s will. God and God; both one God: Almighty and Almighty;
both One Almighty.</p>

oneness of beauty. If all those many souls the dearness of love<note place="end" n="1770" id="iv.vii.iv-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vii.iv-p4"> <i>Charitas</i></p></note> made one

diversity, but entire equality! If on earth and among men there
could be so great charity as of so many souls to make one soul,
where Father from Son, Son from Father, hath been ever inseparable,
could They both be other than One God? Only, those souls might be
called both many souls and one soul; but God, in Whom is ineffable
and highest conjunction, may be called One God, not two
Gods.</p>

Father and a not Almighty Son: it is error, blot it out within you,

begat not Almighty, He begat not very Son. For what say we,
brethren, if the Father being greater begat a Son less than He?
What said I, begat? Man engenders, being greater, a son being less:
it is true: but that is because the one grows old, the other grows
up, and by very growing attains to the form of his father. The Son
of God, if He groweth not because neither can God wax old, was
begotten perfect. And being begotten perfect, if He groweth not,
and remained not less, He is equal. For that ye may know Almighty
begotten of Almighty, hear Him Who is Truth. That which of Itself

Whom is no before? Do not in the least imagine any time before that
Nativity of Christ whereby He was begotten of the Father; of that
Nativity I am speaking by which He is Son of God Almighty, His Only
Son our Lord; of that am I first speaking. Do not imagine in this
Nativity a beginning of time; do not imagine any space of eternity
in which the Father was and the Son was not. Since when the Father
was, since then the Son. And what is that &#8220;since,&#8221; where is no
beginning? Therefore ever Father without beginning, ever Son
without beginning. And how, thou wilt say, was He begotten, if He
have no beginning? Of eternal, coeternal. At no time was the
Father, and the Son not, and yet Son of Father was begotten. Whence
is any manner of similitude to be had? We are among things of
earth, we are in the visible creature. Let the earth give me a
similitude: it gives none. Let the element of the waters give me
some similitude: it hath not whereof to give. Some animal give me a
similitude: neither can this do it. An animal indeed engenders,
both what engenders and what is engendered: but first is the
father, and then is born the son. Let us find the coeval and
imagine it coeternal. If we shall be able to find a father coeval
with his son, and son coeval with his father, let us believe God
the Father coeval with His Son, and God the Son coeternal with His
Father. On earth we can find some coeval, we cannot find any
coeternal. Let us stretch<note place="end" n="1774" id="iv.vii.viii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.vii.viii-p2"> <i>Intendamus</i></p></note> the coeval and imagine it

&#8220;When is it possible for a father to be found coeval with his
son, or son coeval with his father? That the father may beget he
goes before in age; that the son may be begotten, he comes after in
age: but this father coeval with son, or son with father, how can
it be?&#8221; Imagine to yourselves fire as father, its shining as son;
see, we have found the coevals. From the instant that the fire
begins to be, that instant it begets the shining: neither fire
before shining, nor shining after fire. And if we ask, which begets
which? the fire the shining, or the shining the fire? Immediately
ye conceive by natural sense, by the innate wit of your minds ye
all cry out, The fire the shining, not the shining the fire. Lo,
here you have a father beginning; lo, a son at the same time,
neither going before nor coming after. Lo, here then is a father
beginning, lo, a son at the same time beginning. If I have shown
you a father beginning, and a son at the same time beginning,
believe the Father not beginning, and with Him the Son not
beginning either; the one eternal, the other coeternal. If ye get
on with your learning, ye understand: take <pb n="372" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_372.html" id="iv.vii.viii-Page_372"/>pains to get
on. The being born, ye have; but also the growing, ye ought to
have; because no man begins with being perfect. As for the Son of
God, indeed, He could be born perfect, because He was begotten
without time, coeternal with the Father, long before all things,
not in age, but in eternity. He then was begotten coeternal, of

as in Paradise he deceived the man whom God first made, so likewise
here by suggesting blasphemy thought to be able to deceive a man
who pleased God. What things he suffered, my brethren! Who can have
so much to suffer in his estate, his house, his sons, his flesh,

who was left, the devil would have taken away long ago, but that he

lest he should seem to have endured in hope of this. This was not
what he said, not what he hoped. But, that we might be taught, did
the Lord that for him, not hoping for it, by which we should be
taught, that God was with him: because if He had not also restored
to him those things, there was the crown indeed, but hidden, and we
could not see it. And therefore what says the divine Scripture in

is difficult to treat of the virtue of the soul, which is called
Continence, in a manner fully suitable and worthy; but He, whose
great gift this virtue is, will help our littleness under the
burden of so great a weight. For He, who bestows it upon His
faithful ones when they are continent, Himself gives discourse of
it to His ministers when they speak. Lastly, of so great a matter
purposing to speak what Himself shall grant, in the first place we
say and prove that Continence is the gift of God.<note place="end" n="1807" id="v.i.i-p1.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.i.i-p2"> <scripRef passage="Wis. viii. 21" id="v.i.i-p2.2" parsed="|Wis|8|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.8.21">Wis. viii. 21</scripRef></p></note> We have it
written in the Book of Wisdom, that no one can be continent, unless
God grant it. But the Lord, concerning that greater and more
glorious Continence itself, whereby there is continence from the
marriage bond, says, &#8220;Not all can receive this saying, but they
to whom it is given.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1808" id="v.i.i-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.i.i-p3"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 19.11" id="v.i.i-p3.1" parsed="|Matt|19|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.11">Matt. xix. 11</scripRef></p></note> And since marriage chastity also
itself cannot be guarded, unless there be Continence from unlawful
intercourse, the Apostle declared both to be the gift of God, when
He spake of both lives, that is, both that of marriage and that

myself; but each hath his own gift from God; one in this manner,
another in that manner.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1809" id="v.i.i-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.i.i-p4"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 7" id="v.i.i-p4.2" parsed="|1Cor|7|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.7">1 Cor. vii. 7</scripRef></p></note></p>

2. And lest it should seem
that necessary Continence was to be hoped for from the Lord only in
respect of the lust of the lower parts of the flesh, it is also
sung in the Psalm; &#8220;Set, O Lord, a watch to my mouth, and a door
of Continence around my lips.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1810" id="v.i.ii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.i.ii-p2"> <scripRef passage="Ps. cxli. 3" id="v.i.ii-p2.2" parsed="|Ps|141|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.141.3">Ps. cxli. 3</scripRef></p></note> But in this witness of the divine
speech, if we understand &#8220;mouth&#8221; as we ought to understand it,
we perceive how great a gift of God Continence there set is.
Forsooth it is little to contain the mouth of the body, lest any
thing burst forth thence, which is not for the better, through the
sound of the voice. For there is, within, the mouth of the heart,
where he, who spake these words, and wrote them for us to speak,
desired of the Lord that the watch and door of Continence should be
set for him. For many things we say not with the mouth of the body,
and cry aloud with the heart: but there goes forth from the mouth
of the body no word of any thing, whereof there is silence in the
heart. Therefore what flows not forth thence, sounds not abroad:
but what flows forth thence, if it be 
<pb n="380" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_380.html" id="v.i.ii-Page_380"/>evil, although it move
not the tongue, defiles the soul. Therefore Continence must be set
there, where the conscience even of them who are silent speaks. For
it is brought to pass by means of the door of Continence, that
there go not forth thence that, which, even when the lips of the
flesh are closed, pollutes the life of him that hath the
thought.</p>

3. Lastly, to show more
plainly the inner mouth, which by these words he meant, after
having said, &#8220;Set a watch, O Lord, to my mouth, and a door of
Continence around my lips,&#8221; he added straightway, &#8220;Cause not my

what is it but the consent? For he hath not yet spoken, whosoever
in his heart hath with no falling aside of the heart consented unto
suggestions that meet him of each several thing that is seen. But,
if he hath consented, he hath already spoken in his heart, although
he hath not uttered sound by the mouth; although he hath not done
with hand or any part whatever of the body, yet hath he done what
in his thought he hath already determined that he is to do: guilty
by the divine laws, although hidden to human senses; the word
having been spoken in the heart, no deed having been committed
through the body. But in no case would he have moved the limb
without, in a deed, the beginning of which deed had not gone before
within in word. For it is no lie that is written, that &#8220;the

mouth closed, tongue quiet, voice bridled; but yet they do nothing
by work of the body, which they have not before spoken in the
heart. And through this since there are many sins in inward sayings
which are not in outward deeds, whereas there are none in outward
deeds, which do not go before in inward sayings, there will be
purity of innocence from both, if the door of Continence be set
around the inward lips.</p>

sentence, if the whole of it be taken of the mouth of the body, is
absurd. For neither doth vomit defile him, whom food defileth not.
Forsooth food entereth into the mouth, vomit proceedeth forth out

mouth of the flesh, where He says, &#8220;Not what entereth into the
mouth defileth the man,&#8221; but the latter words to the mouth of the

sought of Him an explanation of this as of a parable, He answered,
&#8220;Are ye also yet without understanding? understand ye not, that
whatsoever entereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is
cast out into the draught?&#8221; Here surely we perceive the mouth of
the flesh, into which the food enters. But in what He next adds, in
order that we might recognize the mouth of the heart, the slowness
of our heart would not follow, did not the Truth deign to walk even
with the slow. For He saith, &#8220;But what things go forth from the
mouth, go out of the heart;&#8221; as though He should say, When you
hear it said &#8220;from the mouth,&#8221; understand &#8220;from the heart.&#8221;
I say both, but I set forth one by the other. The inner man hath an
inner mouth, and this the inner ear discerns: what things go forth
from this mouth, go out of the heart, and they defile the man. Then
having left the term mouth, which may be understood also of the
body, He shows more openly what He is saying. &#8220;For from the heart
go out,&#8221; saith He, &#8220;evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies; these are what
defile the man.&#8221; There is surely no one of those evils, which can
be committed also by the members of the body, but that the evil
thoughts go before and defile the man, although something hinder
the sinful and wicked deeds of the body from following. For if,
because power is not given, the hand is free from the murder of a
man, is the heart of the murderer forsooth therefore clean from
sin? Or if she be chaste, whom one unchaste wishes to commit
adultery with, hath he on that account failed to commit adultery
with her in his heart? Or if the harlot be not found in the
brothel, doth he, who seeks her, on that account fail to commit
fornication in his heart? Or if time and place be wanting to one
who wishes to hurt his neighbor by a lie, hath he on that account
failed already to speak false witness with his inner mouth? Or if
any one fearing men, dare not utter aloud blasphemy with tongue of

5. And on this account that,
which, the parts that beget being bridled by modesty, is most
chiefly and properly to be called Continence, is violated by no
transgression, if the higher Continence, concerning which we have
been some time speaking, be preserved in the heart. For this reason
the Lord, after He had said, &#8220;For from the heart go forth evil
thoughts,&#8221; then went on to add what it is that belongs to evil
thoughts, &#8220;murders, adulteries,&#8221; and the rest. He spake not of
all; but, having named certain by way of instance, He taught that
we are to understand others also. Of which there is no one that can
take place, unless an evil thought have gone before, whereby that

the mouth of the heart already defiles the man, although, through
no power being granted, it be not done without by means of the
members of the body. When therefore a door of Continence hath been
set in the mouth of the heart, whence go out all that defile the
man, if nothing such be permitted to go out thence, there followeth
a purity, wherein now the conscience may rejoice; although there be

unto the evils which we feel in us. But, when that consent takes

me that it is one thing to live after man, another thing to live

and thus those wounds not only be not healed, but also, although
they were not deadly, yet may be pressed home to grievous and fatal
harm. And here therefore there is need of a more cautious
Continence, whereby to restrain the proud appetite of man; whereby
he is self-pleased, and unwilling to be found worthy of blame, and
disdains, when he sins, to be convicted that he himself has sinned;
not with healthful humility taking upon him to accuse himself, but
rather with fatal arrogance seeking to find an excuse. In order to
restrain this pride, he, whose words I have already set down above,
and, as I could, commended, sought Continence from the Lord. For,

he cannot hide the deed, or say that it is well done, and still
sees that it is clear that it was done by him, he seeks to refer to
another what he hath done, as though he could remove thence what he
hath deserved. Being unwilling that himself be guilty, he rather
adds to his guilt, and by excusing, not accusing, his own sins, he
knows not that he is putting from him, not punishment, but pardon.
For before human judges, forasmuch as they may be deceived, it
seems to profit somewhat for the time, to cleanse as it were what

14. And some indeed, who are
used to excuse their own sins, complain that they are driven to sin
by fate, as though the stars had decreed this, and heaven had first
sinned by decreeing such, in order that man should after sin by
committing such, and thus had rather impute their sin to fortune:
who think that all things are driven to and fro by chance
accidents, and yet contend that this their wisdom and assertion is
not of chance rashness, but of ascertained reason. What madness
then is it, to lay to reason their discussions, and to make their
actions subject to accidents! Others refer to the devil the whole
of what they do ill: and will not have even a share with him,
whereas they may suspect whether he by hidden suggestions hath
persuaded them to evil, and on the other hand cannot doubt that
they have consented to those suggestions, from whatever source they
have come. There are also they who extend their defense of self
unto an accusation of God, wretched by the divine judgment, but
blasphemers by their own madness. For

in from a contrary principle a substance of evil rebelling, which
He could not have resisted, had He not blended with that same that
was rebelling a portion of His own Substance and Nature, for it to
contaminate and corrupt; and they say that they then sin when the
nature of evil prevails over the nature of God. This is that most
unclean madness of the Manich&#230;ans, whose devilish devices the
undoubted truth most easily overthrows; which confesses that the
nature of God is incapable of contamination and corruption. But
what wicked contamination and corruption do they not deserve to
have believed of them, by whom God, Who is good in the very highest
degree, and in a way that admits not of comparison, is believed to
be capable of contamination and corruption?</p>

15. And there are also they
who in excuse of their sins so accuse God, as to say that sins are
pleasing to Him. For, if they were displeasing, say they, surely by
His most Almighty power He would by no means suffer them to take
place. As though indeed God suffered sins to be unpunished, even in
the case of those whom by remission of sins He frees from eternal
punishment! No one forsooth receives pardon of more grievous
punishment due, unless he hath suffered some punishment, be it what
it may, although far less than what was due: and the fullness of
mercy is so conveyed, as that the justice also of discipline is not
abandoned. For also sin, which seems unavenged, hath its own
attendant punishment, so that there is no one but by reason of what
he hath done either suffers pain from bitterness, or suffers not
through blindness. As therefore you say, Why doth He permit those
things, if they are displeasing? so I say, Why doth He punish them,
if they are pleasing? And thus, as I confess that those things
would not take place at all, unless they were permitted by the
Almighty, so confess thou that what are punished by the Just One
ought not to be done; in order that, by not doing what He punishes,
we may deserve to learn of Him, why He permits to exist what He
punishes. For, as it is written, &#8220;solid food is for the

they who have made good progress already understand, that it

great forsooth is His Almighty goodness, as that even of evil He
can make good, either by pardoning, or by healing, or by fitting
and turning unto the profit of the pious, or even by most justly
taking vengeance. For all these are good, and most worthy a good
and Almighty God: and yet they are not made save of evils. What
therefore better, what more Almighty, than He, Who, whereas He
maketh no evil, even of evils maketh well? They who have done ill

sin is unjust, so the punishment of sin is just.</p>

shall be for ever made subject unto the spirit, to be quickened by
Christ. Therefore these two things, which are now opposed the one
to the other within us, since we exist in both, let us pray and
endeavor that they may agree. For we ought not to think the one of
them an enemy, but the fault, whereby the flesh lusteth against the
spirit: and this, when healed, will itself cease to exist, and
either substance will be safe, and no strife between either. Let us
hear the Apostle; &#8220;I know,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;that there dwelleth
not in me, that is, in my flesh, any good.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1871" id="v.i.xix-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.i.xix-p3"> <scripRef passage="Rom. vii. 18" id="v.i.xix-p3.2" parsed="|Rom|7|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.7.18">Rom. vii. 18</scripRef></p></note> This certainly he saith; that the
fault of the flesh, in a good thing, is not good; and, when this

to our nature the same teacher shows, by saying, first, &#8220;I know
that there dwelleth not in me,&#8221; in order to expound which, he
added, &#8220;that is, in my flesh, any good.&#8221; Therefore he saith
that his flesh is himself. It is not then itself that is our enemy:
and when its faults are resisted, itself is loved, because itself
is cared for; &#8220;For no one ever hated his own flesh,&#8221;<note place="end" n="1873" id="v.i.xix-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.i.xix-p5"> <scripRef passage="Eph. v. 29" id="v.i.xix-p5.2" parsed="|Eph|5|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.5.29">Eph. v. 29</scripRef></p></note> as the

myself with the mind serve the Law of God, but with the flesh the

&#8220;with the flesh the law of sin?&#8221; was it at all by consenting
unto fleshly lust? Far be it! but by having there motions of

consenting to them, with the mind he served the Law of God, and
kept his members from becoming weapons of sins.</p>

20. There are therefore in us
evil desires, by consenting not unto which we live not ill: there
are in us lusts of sins, by obeying not which we perfect not evil,
but by having them do not as yet perfect good. The Apostle shows
both, that neither is good here perfected, where evil is so lusted
after, nor evil here perfected, whereas such lust is not obeyed.
The one forsooth he shows, where he says, &#8220;To will is present
with me, but to perfect good is not;&#8221;<note place="end" n="1875" id="v.i.xx-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.i.xx-p2"> <scripRef passage="Rom. vii. 18" id="v.i.xx-p2.2" parsed="|Rom|7|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.7.18">Rom. vii. 18</scripRef></p></note> the other, where he says, &#8220;Walk
in the Spirit, and perfect not the lusts of the flesh.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1876" id="v.i.xx-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.i.xx-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gal. v. 16" id="v.i.xx-p3.2" parsed="|Gal|5|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.5.16">Gal. v. 16</scripRef></p></note> For
neither in the former place doth he say that to do good is not with
him, but &#8220;to perfect,&#8221; nor here doth he say, Have not &#8220;lusts
of the flesh,&#8221; but &#8220;perfect not.&#8221; Therefore there take place
in us evil lusts, when that pleases which is not lawful; but they
are not perfected, when evil lusts are restrained by the mind
serving the Law of God. And good takes place, when that, which
wrongly pleases, takes not place through the good delight
prevailing. But the perfection of good is not fulfilled, so long as
by the flesh serving the law of sin, evil lust entices, and,
although it be restrained, is yet moved. For there would be no need
for it to be restrained, were it not moved. There will be at some
time also the perfection of good, when the destruction of evil: the
one will be highest, the other will be no more. And if we think
that this is to be hoped for in this mortal state, we are deceived.
For it shall be then, when death shall not be; and it shall be
there, where shall be life eternal. For in that world,<note place="end" n="1877" id="v.i.xx-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.i.xx-p4"> <i>S&#230;culo</i></p></note> and in
that kingdom, there shall be highest good, no evil: when there
shall be, and where there shall be, highest love of wisdom, no
labor of continence. Therefore the flesh is not evil, if it be void
of evil, that is, of fault, whereby man was rendered faulty, not
made ill, but himself making. For on either part, that is, both
soul and body, being made good by the good God, himself made the
evil, whereby he was made evil. From the guilt of which evil being
already also set free through forgiveness,<note place="end" n="1878" id="v.i.xx-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.i.xx-p5"> <i>Indulgentiam</i></p></note> that he may not think what he hath
done to be light, he yet wars with his own fault through
continence. But far be it that there be any faults in such as reign
in that peace which shall be hereafter; since in this state of war
there are lessened daily in such as make progress, not sins only,
but the very lusts also, with which, by not consenting, we strive,
and by consenting unto which we sin.</p>

21. That, therefore, the
flesh lusteth against the Spirit, that there dwelleth not in our
flesh good, that the law in our members is opposed to the law of
the mind, is not a mingling of two natures caused of contrary
principles, but a division of one against itself caused through
desert of sin. We were not so in Adam, before that nature, having
listened to and followed its deceiver, had despised and offended
its Creator: that is, not the former life of man created, but the
latter punishment of man condemned. From which condemnation when
set free by Grace, through Jesus Christ, being free they contend
with their punishment, having received not as yet full salvation,
but already a pledge of salvation: but when not set free, they are
both guilty by reason of sins, and involved in punishments. But
after this life for the guilty <pb n="388" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_388.html" id="v.i.xxi-Page_388"/>there will remain for ever
punishment for their crime: for the free there will no more remain
for ever either crime or punishment: but the good substances,
spirit and flesh, will continue for ever, which God, Who is good,
and incapable of change, created good although capable of change.
But they will continue having been changed for the better, never
from this time to be changed for the worse: all evil being utterly
destroyed, both what man hath unjustly done, and what he hath
justly suffered. And, these two kinds of evil perishing utterly,
whereof the one is of iniquity going before, the other of
unhappiness following after, the will of man will be upright
without any depravity. There it will be clear and plain to all,
what now many of the faithful believe, few understand, that evil is
not a substance: but that, as a wound in a body, so in a substance,
which hath made itself faulty, it hath begun to exist, when the
disease hath commenced, and ceaseth to exist in it, when the
healing hath been perfected. Therefore, all evil having arisen from
us, and having been destroyed in us, our good also having been
increased and perfected unto the height of most happy incorruption
and immortality, of what kind shall either of our substances be?

23. The Apostle has made
known to us certain three unions, Christ and the Church, husband
and wife, spirit and flesh. Of these the former consult for the
good of the latter, the latter wait upon the former. All the things
are good, when, in them, certain set over by way of pre-eminence,
certain made subject in a becoming manner, observe the beauty of
order. Husband and wife receive command and pattern how they ought
to be one with another. The command is, &#8220;Let wives be subject
unto their own husbands, as unto the Lord; because the husband is
the head of the wife;&#8221;<note place="end" n="1889" id="v.i.xxiii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.i.xxiii-p2"> <scripRef passage="Eph. v. 22-28" id="v.i.xxiii-p2.2" parsed="|Eph|5|22|5|28" osisRef="Bible:Eph.5.22-Eph.5.28">Eph. v. 22&#8211;28</scripRef></p></note> and, &#8220;Husbands, love your
wives.&#8221; But there is given a pattern, unto wives from the Church,
unto husbands from Christ: &#8220;As the Church,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;is
subject unto Christ, so also wives unto their own husbands in all
things.&#8221; In like manner also, having given command to husbands to
love their own wives, he added a pattern, &#8220;As Christ loved the
Church.&#8221; But husbands he exhorted to it from a lower matter also,
that is, from their own body: not only from a higher, that is, from
their Lord. <pb n="389" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_389.html" id="v.i.xxiii-Page_389"/>For he not only saith,
&#8220;Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the Church,&#8221;
which is from an higher: but he said also, &#8220;Husbands ought to
love their own wives, as their own bodies,&#8221; which is from a
lower: because both higher and lower are all good. And yet the
woman received not pattern from the body, or flesh, to be so
subject to the husband as the flesh to the spirit; but either the
Apostle would have understood by consequence, what he omitted to
state: or haply because the flesh lusteth against the spirit in the
mortal and sick estate of this life, therefore he would not set the
woman a pattern of subjection from it. But the men he would for
this reason, because, although the spirit lusteth against the
flesh, even in this it consults for the good of the flesh: not like
as the flesh lusting against the spirit, by such opposition
consulteth neither for the good of the spirit, nor for its own. Yet
the good spirit would not consult for its good, whether by
nourishing and cherishing its nature by forethought, or by
resisting its faults by continence, were it not that each substance
showeth God to be the Creator of each, even by the seemliness of
this its order. What is it, therefore, that with true madness ye
both boast yourselves to be Christians, and with so great,
perverseness contend against the Christian Scriptures, with eyes
closed, or rather put out, asserting both that Christ hath appeared
unto mortals in false flesh, and that the Church in the soul
pertains to Christ, in the body to the devil, and that the male and
female sex are works of the devil, not of God, and that the flesh
is joined unto the spirit, as an evil substance unto a good
substance?</p>

26. Thus much will suffice to
have treated on behalf of true Continence against the Manichees
deceitfully continent, lest the fruitful and glorious labor of
Continence, when it restrains and curbs the lowest part of us, that
is, the body, from immoderate and unlawful pleasures, be believed
not healthfully to chasten, but hostilely to persecute. Forsooth
the body is indeed different from the nature of the soul, yet is it
not alien from the nature of man: for the soul is not made up of
body, but yet man is made up of soul and body: and assuredly, whom
God frees, He frees the whole man. Whence our Saviour Himself also
took upon Him the whole man, having deigned to free in us all that
He made. They who hold contrary to this truth, what doth it profit
them to restrain lusts? if, that is, they restrain any. What in
them can be made clean through Continence, whose such Continence is
unclean? and which ought not to be called Continence. Forsooth to
hold <pb n="391" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_391.html" id="v.i.xxvi-Page_391"/>what they hold is the poison of the devil; but
Continence is the gift of God. But as not every one who suffers any
thing, or with the greatest endurance suffers any pain whatever,
possesses that virtue, which in like manner is the gift of God, and
is called Patience; for many endure many torments, in order not to
betray either such as are wickedly privy with them in their crimes,
or themselves; many in order to satiate glowing lusts, and to
obtain, or not to abandon those things, whereunto they are bound by
chain of evil love; many on behalf of different and destructive
errors, whereby they are strongly held: of all of whom far be it
from us to say that they have true patience: thus not every one,
who contains in any thing, or who marvellously retrains even the
very lusts of the flesh, or mind, is to be said to possess that
continence, of the profit and beauty of which we are treating. For
certain, what may seem marvellous to say, through incontinence
contain themselves: as if a woman were to contain herself from her
husband, because she hath sworn this to an adulterer. Certain
through injustice, as if spouse yield not to spouse the due of
sexual intercourse, because he or she is already able to overcome
such appetite of the body. Also certain contain deceived by false
faith, and hoping what is vain, and following after what is vain:
among whom are all heretics, and whosoever under the name of
religion are deceived by any error: whose continence would be true,
if their faith also were true: but, whereas that is not to be
called faith, on this account, because it is false; without doubt
that also is unworthy the name of continence. For what? are we
prepared to call continence, which we must truly say is the gift of
God, sin? Far be from our hearts so hateful madness. But the
blessed Apostle saith &#8220;Every thing that is not of faith is
sin.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1910" id="v.i.xxvi-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.i.xxvi-p2"> <scripRef passage="Rom. xiv. 23" id="v.i.xxvi-p2.2" parsed="|Rom|14|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.14.23">Rom. xiv. 23</scripRef></p></note> What

27. There are also they who,
in doing open service to evil demons, contain from pleasures of the
body, that, through their means, they may satisfy unlawful
pleasures, the violence and glow whereof they contain not. Whence
also, (to name one case, and pass over the rest in silence by
reason of the length of the discourse,) certain come not near even
unto their own wives, whilst, as though clean, they essay through
magic arts to gain access unto the wives of others. O marvellous
continence, nay rather, singular wickedness and uncleanness! For,
if it were true continence, the lust of the flesh ought rather to
contain from adultery, than, in order to commit adultery, from
marriage. Forsooth marriage continence is wont to ease this lust of
the flesh, and to check its curb but thus far, that neither in
marriage itself it run riot by immoderate license, but that a
measure be observed, either such as is due to the weakness of the
spouse, unto whom the Apostle enjoins not this, as of command, but
yields it as of permission;<note place="end" n="1911" id="v.i.xxvii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.i.xxvii-p2"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 6" id="v.i.xxvii-p2.2" parsed="|1Cor|7|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.6">1 Cor. vii. 6</scripRef></p></note> or such as is suited for the
begetting of sons, which was formerly the one alone occasion of
sexual intercourse to both holy fathers and mothers. But continence
doing this, that is, moderating, and in a certain way limiting in
married persons the lust of the flesh, and ordering in a certain
way within fixed limits its unquiet and inordinate motion, uses
well the evil of man, whom it makes and wills to make perfect good:

goodness.</p>

we say of continence, of which Scripture saith. &#8220;And this very

containing, either serve errors, or overcome any lesser desires for
this purpose, that they may fulfill others, by the greatness of
which they are overcome. But that continence which is true, coming
from above, wills not to repress some evils by other evils, but to
heal all evils by goods. And, briefly to comprehend its mode of
action, it is the place of continence to keep watch to restrain and
heal all delights whatsoever of lust, which are opposed to the
delight of wisdom. Whence without doubt they set it within too
narrow bounds, who limit it to restraining the lusts of the body
alone: certainly they speak better, who say that it pertains to
Continence to rule in general lust or desire. Which desire is set
down as a fault, nor is it only of the body, but also of the soul.
For, if the desire of the body be in fornications and
drunkennesses; hard enmities, strifes, emulations, lastly, hatreds,
their exercise in the pleasure of the body, and not rather in the
motion and troubled states of the soul? Yet the Apostle called all
these &#8220;works of the flesh,&#8221; whether what pertained to the soul,
or what pertained properly to the flesh, calling forsooth the man

Spirit lusteth against the flesh, this business proceeds with great
earnestness, resistance is offered unto evil delights, unclean
lusts, carnal and shameful motions, by the sweetness of holiness,
by the love of chastity, by spiritual vigor, and by the beauty of
continence; thus they are laid down by them who are dead to them,
and who live not in them by consenting. Thus, I say, they are put
down, whilst they are weighed down by continued continence, that
they rise not again. Whosoever, as though secure, shall cease from
this laying aside of them, straightway they will assault the
Citadel of the mind, and will themselves put it down thence, and
will reduce it into slavery to them, captive after a base and
unseemly fashion. Then sin will reign in the mortal body of man to
obey its desires; then will it yield its members weapons of

<span class="c9" id="v.ii.i-p1.1">This</span> 
treatise, and the following, were written against somewhat that
still remained of the heresy of Jovinian. S. Aug. mentions this
error in b. ii. c. 23, <i>de Nuptiis et Conc</i>. &#8220;Jovinianus,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;who a few years since tried to found a new heresy, said
that the Catholics favored the Manich&#230;ans, because in opposition
to him they preferred holy Virginity to Marriage.&#8221; And in his
book on <i>Heresies</i>, c. 82. &#8220;That heresy took its rise from
one Jovinianus, a Monk, in our own time, when we were yet young.&#8221;
And he adds that it was soon overborne and extinguished, say about
<span class="c19" id="v.ii.i-p1.2">A.D.</span> 390, having been condemned first at
Rome, then at Milan. There are letters of Pope Siricius on the
subject to the Church of Milan, and the answer sent him by the
Synod of Milan, at which St. Ambrose presided. Jerome had refuted
Jovinian, but was said to have attempted the defense of the
excellency of the virgin state, at the expense of condemning
marriage. That Augustin might not be subject to any such complaint
or calumny, before speaking of the superiority of Virginity, he
thought it well to write on the Good of Marriage.</p>

<p class="c49" id="v.ii.i-p2">This work we learn to have been
finished about the year 401, not only from the order of his <i>
Retractations</i>, but also from his books on Genesis after the
Letter, begun about that year. For in b. ix. on Genesis, c. 7,
where he commends the Good of Marriage, he says: &#8220;Now this is
threefold, faithfulness, offspring, and the Sacrament. For
faithfulness, it is observed, that there be no lying with other man
or woman, out of the bond of wedlock: for the offspring, that it be
lovingly welcomed, kindly nourished, religiously brought up: for
the Sacrament, that marriage be not severed, and that man or woman
divorced be not joined to another even for the sake of offspring.
This is as it were the rule of Marriages by which rule either
fruitfulness is made seemly, or the perverseness of incontinence is
brought to order. Upon which since we have sufficiently discoursed
in that book, which we lately published, <i>on the Good of
Marriage</i>, where we have also distinguished the Widow&#8217;s
continence and the Virgin&#8217;s excellency, according to the
worthiness of their degrees, our pen is not to be now longer
occupied.&#8221; This very work is referred to in Book I. on the <i>
Deserts and Remission of Sins</i>, c. 29.&#8212;<i>Bened.
Ed.</i></p>

<p class="c10" id="v.ii.i-p5">The Editors are, of course, aware
of the danger there is in reading a treatise like the following in
a spirit of idle curiosity, and they beg any reader who has not
well assured <pb n="398" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_398.html" id="v.ii.i-Page_398"/>himself that his
aim is right and holy to abstain from perusing it. At the same time
it must not be forgotten, that something far other than a mere
shrinking from subjects offensive to modern delicacy is needed, in
order to purify the thoughts with respect to the holy estate of
Matrimony. The mind that will but seriously attend to it in that
light, will certainly be strengthened against evil suggestions by
seeing in the whole subject a field of Christian duty.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.ii.i-p6">It seemed further requisite to
bring forward a work calculated to remove the imputation so falsely
cast on the holy Fathers, that they regarded Matrimony as unholy,
and almost agreed with the Manichean view of it, as a defilement
and degradation to the Christian. They did, it is true, prefer
Virginity to Marriage, but as St. Augustin expressly states, as the
&#8220;better of two good things,&#8221; not as though one were good, and
the other evil.</p>

<p class="c10" id="v.ii.i-p7">In estimating the work and the
writer, the age in which it was written must be kept in view, and
what that age required must not be imputed as a fault to him or to
his religion. And perhaps what was written for another age may
serve the more safely towards our improvement and guidance from the
very circumstance that the style and manner of antiquity has become
a kind of veil, which takes off somewhat from the strength and
vividness of first impressions, and leaves the mind more at liberty
to use what is laid before it as it will, than a more modern way of
speaking would be likely to do. Let that liberty be used rightly
and conscientiously, and the effect of reading will be
good.&#8212;<i>Eds. of the Oxford Library.</i></p>

death, which by the malice of the devil entered into the world, and

3. This we now say, that,
according to this condition of being born and dying, which we know,
and in which we have been created, the marriage of male and female
is some good; the compact whereof divine Scripture so commends, as
that neither is it allowed one put away by her husband to marry, so
long as her husband lives: nor is it allowed one put away by his
wife to marry another, unless she who have separated from him be
dead. Therefore, concerning the good of marriage, which the Lord
also confirmed in the Gospel, not only in that He forbade to put
away a wife,<note place="end" n="1940" id="v.ii.iv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.iv-p2"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 19.9" id="v.ii.iv-p2.1" parsed="|Matt|19|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.9">Matt. xix. 9</scripRef></p></note> save
because of fornication, but also in that He came by invitation to a
marriage,<note place="end" n="1941" id="v.ii.iv-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.iv-p3"> <scripRef passage="John ii. 2" id="v.ii.iv-p3.2" parsed="|John|2|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.2.2">John ii. 2</scripRef></p></note> there is
good ground to inquire for what reason it be a good. And this seems
not to me to be merely on account of the begetting of children, but
also on account of the natural society itself in a difference of
sex. Otherwise it would not any longer be called marriage in the
case of old persons, especially if either they had lost sons, or
had given birth to none. But now in good, although aged, marriage,
albeit there hath withered away the glow of full age between male
and female, yet there lives in full vigor the order of charity
between husband and wife: because, the better they are, the earlier
they have begun by mutual consent to contain from sexual
intercourse with each other: not that it should be matter of
necessity afterwards not to have power to do what they would, but
that it should be matter of praise to have been unwilling at the
first, to do what they had power to do. If therefore there be kept
good faith of honor, and of services mutually due from either sex,
although the members of either be languishing and almost
corpse-like, yet of souls duly joined together, the chastity<note place="end" n="1942" id="v.ii.iv-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.iv-p4"> Perhaps &#8220;charity.&#8221;</p></note> continues,
the purer by how much it is the more proved, the safer, by how much
it is the calmer. Marriages have this good also, that carnal or
youthful incontinence, although it be faulty, is brought unto an
honest use in the begetting of children, in order that out of the
evil of lust the marriage union may bring to pass some good. Next,
in that the lust of the flesh is repressed, and rages in a way more
modestly, being tempered by parental affection. For there is
interposed a certain gravity of glowing pleasure, when in that
wherein husband and wife cleave to one another, they have in mind
that they be father and mother.</p>

4. There is this further, that
in that very debt which married persons pay one to another, even if
they demand it with somewhat too great intemperance and
incontinence, yet they owe faith alike one to another. Unto which
faith the Apostle allows so great right, as to call it &#8220;power,&#8221;
saying, &#8220;The woman hath not power of her own body, but the man;
again in like manner also the man hath not power of his own body,
but the woman.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1943" id="v.ii.v-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.v-p2"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 4" id="v.ii.v-p2.2" parsed="|1Cor|7|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.4">1 Cor. vii. 4</scripRef></p></note> But the violation of this faith is
called adultery, when either by instigation of one&#8217;s own lust, or
by consent of lust of another, there is sexual intercourse on
either side with another against the marriage compact: and thus
faith is broken, which, even in things that are of the body, and
mean, is a great good of the soul: and therefore it is certain that
it ought to be preferred even to the health of the body, wherein
even this life of ours is contained. For, although a little chaff
in comparison of much gold is almost nothing; yet faith, when it is
kept pure in a matter of chaff, as in gold, is not therefore less
because it is kept in a lesser matter. But when faith is employed
to commit sin, it were strange that we should have to call it
faith; however of what kind soever it be, if also the deed be done
against it, it is the worse done; save when it is on this account
abandoned, that there may be a return unto true and lawful faith,
that is, that sin may be amended, by correction of perverseness of
the will. As if any, being unable alone to rob a man, should find a
partner in his iniquity, and make an agreement with him to do it
together, and to divide the spoil; and, after the crime hath been
committed, should take off the whole to himself alone. That other
grieves and complains that faith hath not been kept with him, but
in his very complaint he ought to consider, that he himself rather
ought to have kept faith with human society in a good life,
and <pb n="401" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_401.html" id="v.ii.v-Page_401"/>not to make unjust spoil of a man, if he feels with how
great injustice it hath failed to be kept with himself in a
fellowship of sin. Forsooth the former, being faithless in both
instances, must assuredly be judged the more wicked. But, if he had
been displeased at what they had done ill, and had been on this
account unwilling to divide the spoil with his partner in crime, in
order that it might be restored to the man, from whom it had been
taken, not even a faithless man would call him faithless. Thus a
woman, if, having broken her marriage faith, she keep faith with
her adulterer, is certainly evil: but, if not even with her
adulterer, worse. Further, if she repent her of her sin, and
returning to marriage chastity, renounce all adulterous compacts
and resolutions, I count it strange if even the adulterer himself
will think her one who breaks faith.</p>

5. Also the question is wont
to be asked, when a male and female, neither the one the husband,
nor the other the wife, of any other, come together, not for the
begetting of children, but, by reason of incontinence, for the mere
sexual intercourse, there being between them this faith, that
neither he do it with any other woman, nor she with any other man,
whether it is to be called marriage.<note place="end" n="1944" id="v.ii.vi-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.vi-p2"> <i>Nupti&#339;</i></p></note> And perhaps this may, not without

parties until the death of one, and if the begetting of children,
although they came not together for that cause, yet they shun not,
so as either to be unwilling to have children born to them, or even
by some evil work to use means that they be not born. But, if
either both, or one, of these be wanting, I find not how we can
call it marriage. For, if a man should take unto him any one for a
time, until he find another worthy either of his honors or of his
means, to marry as his compeer; in his soul itself he is an
adulterer, and that not with her whom he is desirous of finding,
but with her, with whom he so lies, as not to have with her the
partnership of a husband. Whence she also herself, knowing and
willing this, certainly acts unchastely in having intercourse with
him, with whom she has not the compact of a wife. However, if she
keep to him faith of bed, and after he shall have married, have no
thought of marriage herself, and prepare to contain herself
altogether from any such work, perhaps I should not dare lightly to
call her an adulteress; but who shall say that she sins not, when
he is aware that she has intercourse with a man, not being his
wife? But further, if from that intercourse, so far as pertains to
herself, she has no wish but for sons, and suffers unwilling
whatever she suffers beyond the cause of begetting; there are many
matrons to whom she is to be preferred; who, although they are not
adulteresses, yet force their husbands, for the most part also
wishing to exercise continence, to pay the due of the flesh, not
through desire of children, but through glow of lust making an
intemperate use of their very right; in whose marriages, however,
this very thing, that they are married, is a good. For for this
purpose are they married, that the lust being brought under a
lawful bond, should not float at large without form and loose;
having of itself weakness of flesh that cannot be curbed, but of
marriage fellowship of faith that cannot be dissolved; of itself
encroachment of immoderate intercourse, of marriage a way of
chastely begetting. For, although it be shameful to wish to use a
husband for purposes of lust, yet it is honorable to be unwilling
to have intercourse save with an husband, and not to give birth to
children save from a husband. There are also men incontinent to
that degree, that they spare not their wives even when pregnant.
Therefore whatever that is immodest, shameless, base, married
persons do one with another, is the sin of the persons, not the
fault of marriage.</p>

6. Further, in the very case
of the more immoderate requirement of the due of the flesh, which
the Apostle enjoins not on them by way of command, but allows to
them by way of leave, that they have intercourse also beside the
cause of begetting children; although evil habits impel them to
such intercourse, yet marriage guards them from adultery or
fornication. For neither is that committed because of marriage, but
is pardoned because of marriage. Therefore married persons owe one
another not only the faith of their sexual intercourse itself, for
the begetting of children, which is the first fellowship of the
human kind in this mortal state; but also, in a way, a mutual
service of sustaining<note place="end" n="1947" id="v.ii.vii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.vii-p2"> <i>Excipiend&#230;</i></p></note> one another&#8217;s weakness, in order
to shun unlawful intercourse: so that, although perpetual
continence be pleasing to one of them, he may not, save with
consent of the other. For thus far also, &#8220;The wife hath not power
of her own body, but the man: in like manner also the man hath not

the other; lest by this they fall into damnable seductions, through
temptation of Satan, by reason of incontinence either of both, or
of whichever of them. For intercourse of marriage for the sake of
begetting hath not fault; but for the satisfying of lust, but yet
with husband or wife, by reason of the faith of the bed, it hath
venial fault: but adultery or fornication hath deadly fault, and,
through this, continence from all intercourse is indeed better even
than the intercourse of marriage itself, which takes place for the
sake of begetting. But because that Continence is of larger desert,
but to pay the due of marriage is no crime, but to demand it beyond
the necessity of begetting is a venial fault, but to commit
fornication or adultery is a crime to be punished; charity of the
married ought to beware, lest whilst it seek for itself occasion of
larger honor, it do that for its partner which cause condemnation.

7. But I marvel, if, as it is
allowed to put away a wife who is an adulteress, so it be allowed,
having put her away, to marry another. For holy Scripture causes a
hard knot in this matter, in that the Apostle says, that, by
commandment of the Lord, the wife ought not to depart from her
husband, but, in case she shall have departed, to remain unmarried,
or to be reconciled to her husband;<note place="end" n="1950" id="v.ii.viii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.viii-p2"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 10, 11" id="v.ii.viii-p2.2" parsed="|1Cor|7|10|7|11" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.10-1Cor.7.11">1 Cor. vii. 10, 11</scripRef></p></note> whereas surely she ought not to
depart and remain unmarried, save from an husband that is an
adulterer, lest by withdrawing from him, who is not an adulterer,
she cause him to commit adultery. But perhaps she may justly be
reconciled to her husband, either he being to be borne with, if she
cannot contain herself, or being now corrected. But I see not how
the man can have permission to marry another, in case he have left
an adulteress, when a woman has not to be married to another, in
case she have left an adulterer. And, this being the case, so
strong is that bond of fellowship in married persons, that,
although it be tied for the sake f begetting children, not even for
the sake of begetting children is it loosed. For it is in a man&#8217;s
power to put away a wife that is barren, and marry one of whom to
have children. And yet it is not allowed; and now indeed in our
times, and after the usage of Rome, neither to marry in addition,
so as to have more than one wife living: and, surely, in case of an
adulteress or adulterer being left, it would be possible that more
men should be born, if either the woman were married to another, or
the man should marry another. And yet, if this be not lawful, as
the Divine Rule seems to prescribe, who is there but it must make
him attentive to learn, what is the meaning of this so great
strength of the marriage bond? Which I by no means think could have
been of so great avail, were it not that there were taken a certain
sacrament of some greater matter from out this weak mortal state of
men, so that, men deserting it, and seeking to dissolve it, it
should remain unshaken for their punishment. Seeing that the
compact of marriage is not done away by divorce intervening; so
that they continue wedded persons one to another, even after
separation; and commit adultery with those, with whom they shall be
joined, even after their own divorce, either the woman with a man,
or the man with a woman. And yet, save in the City of our God, in
His Holy Mount, the case is not such with the wife.<note place="end" n="1951" id="v.ii.viii-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.viii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xlviii. 1" id="v.ii.viii-p3.2" parsed="|Ps|48|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.48.1">Ps. xlviii. 1</scripRef></p></note> But, that

as the repasts of the Just are better than the fasts of the
sacrilegious, so the marriage of the faithful is to be set before
the virginity of the impious. However neither in that case is
repast preferred to fasting, but righteousness to sacrilege; nor in
this, marriage to virginity, but faith to impiety. For for this end
the righteous, when need is, take their repast, that, as good
masters, they may give to their slaves, <i>i.e.,</i> their bodies,
what is just and fair: but for this end the sacrilegious fast, that
they may serve devils. Thus for this end the faithful are married,
that they may be chastely joined unto husbands, but for this end
the impious are virgins, that they may commit fornication away from
the true God. As, therefore, that was good, which Martha was doing,
being engaged in the ministering unto the Saints, but that better,

doing, the better could not be done, unless the other had been
passed over or left. Whence we are to understand, that we are not,
on this account, to think marriage an evil, because, unless there
be abstinence from it, widowed chastity, or virgin purity, cannot
be had. For neither on this account was what Martha was doing evil,
because, unless her sister abstained from it, she could not do what
was better: nor on this account is it evil to receive a just man or
a prophet into one&#8217;s house, because he, who wills to follow
Christ unto perfection, ought not even to have a house, in order to
do what is better.</p>

9. Truly we must consider,
that God gives us some goods, which are to be sought for their own
sake, such as wisdom, health, friendship: but others, which are
necessary for the sake of somewhat, such as learning, meat, drink,
sleep, marriage, sexual intercourse. For of these certain are
necessary for the sake of wisdom, as learning: certain for the sake
of health, as meat and drink and sleep: certain for the sake of
friendship, as marriage or sexual intercourse: for hence subsists
the propagation of the human kind, wherein friendly fellowship is a
great good. These goods, therefore, which are necessary for the
sake of something else, whoso useth not for this purpose, wherefore
they were instituted, sins; in some cases venially, in other cases
damnably. But whoso useth them for this purpose, wherefore they
were given doeth well. Therefore, to whomsoever they are not
necessary, if he use them not, he doeth better. Wherefore, these
goods, when we have need, we do well to wish; but we do better not
to wish than to wish: because ourselves are in a better state, when
we account them not necessary. And on this account it is good to
marry, because it is good to beget children, to be a mother of a
family: but it is better not to marry,<note place="end" n="1961" id="v.ii.x-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.x-p2"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 14" id="v.ii.x-p2.2" parsed="|1Tim|5|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.14">1 Tim. v. 14</scripRef></p></note> because it is better not to stand
in need of this work, in order to human fellowship itself. For such
is the state of the human race now, that (others, who contain not,
not only being taken up with marriage, but many also waxing wanton
through unlawful concubinages, the Good Creator working what is
good out of their evils) there fails not numerous progeny, and
abundant succession, out of which to procure holy friendships.
Whence we gather, that, in the first times of the human race,
chiefly for the propagation of the People of God, through whom the
Prince and Saviour of all people should both be prophesied of, and
be born, it was the duty of the Saints to use this good of
marriage, not as to be sought for its own sake, but necessary for
the sake of something else: but now, whereas, in order to enter
upon holy and pure fellowship, there is on all sides from out all
nations an overflowing fullness of spiritual kindred, even they who
wish to contract marriage only for the sake of children, are to be
admonished, that they use rather the larger good of
continence.</p>

that sexual intercourse, which takes place through incontinence,
not alone for the begetting of children, and, at times, not at all
for the begetting of children; and it is not that marriage forces
this to take place, but that it procures pardon for it; provided
however it be not so in excess as to hinder what ought to be set
aside as seasons of prayer, nor be changed into that use which is
against nature, on which the Apostle could not be silent, when
speaking of the excessive corruptions of unclean and impious men.
For necessary sexual intercourse for begetting is free from blame,
and itself is alone worthy of marriage. But that which goes beyond
this necessity, no longer follows reason, but lust.<note place="end" n="1969" id="v.ii.xii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.xii-p5"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 26, 27" id="v.ii.xii-p5.2" parsed="|Rom|1|26|1|27" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.26-Rom.1.27">Rom. i. 26, 27</scripRef></p></note> And yet it
pertains to the character of marriage, not to exact this, but to
yield it to the partner, lest by fornication the other sin

plainly not matter of marriage. However, if in their intercourse
they love what is honest more than what is dishonest, that is, what
is matter of marriage more than what is not matter of marriage,
this is allowed to them on the authority of the Apostle as matter
of pardon: and for this fault, they have in their marriage, not
what sets them on to commit it, but what entreats pardon for it, if
they turn not away from them the mercy of God, either by not
abstaining on certain days, that they may be free to pray, and
through this abstinence, as through fasting, may commend their
prayers; or by changing the natural use into that which is against
nature, which is more damnable when it is done in the case of
husband or wife.</p>

12. For, whereas that natural
use, when it pass beyond the compact of marriage, that is, beyond
the necessity of begetting, is pardonable in the case of a wife,
damnable in the case of an harlot; that which is against nature is
execrable when done in the case of an harlot, but more execrable in
the case of a wife. Of so great power is the ordinance of the
Creator, and the order of Creation, that, in matters allowed us to
use, even when the due measure is exceeded, it is far more
tolerable, than, in what are not allowed, either a single, or rare
excess. And, therefore, in a matter allowed, want of moderation, in
a husband or wife, is to be borne with, in order that lust break
not forth into a matter that is not allowed. Hence is it also that
he sins far less, who is ever so unceasing in approaches to his
wife, than he who approaches ever so seldom to commit fornication.
But, when the man shall wish to use the member of the wife not
allowed for this purpose, the wife is more shameful, if she suffer
it to take place in her own case, than if in the case of another

be such as have made trial of marriage, or such as are entirely
free from all such intercourse: forsooth they are without number:

declaring to us that he has never had sexual intercourse with his

of a tyrannical rebellion deserve praise, if the tyrant treat his
subjects with royal clemency: nor will the order of royal power
deserve blame, if a king rage with tyrannical cruelty. For it is
one thing to wish to use well unjust power, and it is another thing

lawful; nor do married women, if they live wantonly with their

17. That marriage can take
place of persons first ill joined, an honest decree following
after, is manifest. But a marriage once for all entered upon in the
City of our God, where, even from the first union of the two, the
man and the woman, marriage bears a certain sacramental character,
can no way be dissolved but by the death of one of them. For the
bond of marriage remains, although a family, for the sake of which
it was entered upon, do not follow through manifest barrenness; so
that, when now married persons know that they shall not have
children, yet it is not lawful for them to separate even for the
very sake of children, and to join themselves unto others. And if
they shall so do, they commit adultery with those unto whom they
join themselves, but themselves remain husbands and wives. Clearly
with the good will of the wife to take another woman, that from her
may be born sons common to both, by the sexual intercourse and seed
of the one, but by the right and power of the other, was lawful
among the ancient fathers: whether it be lawful now also, I would
not hastily pronounce. For there is not now necessity of begetting
children, as there then was, when, even when wives bare children,
it was allowed, in order to a more numerous posterity, to marry
other wives in addition, which now is certainly not lawful. For the
difference that separates times causes the due season to have so
great force unto the justice and doing or not doing any thing, that
now a man does better, if he marry not even one wife, unless he be
unable to contain. But then they married even several without any
blame, even <pb n="407" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_407.html" id="v.ii.xviii-Page_407"/>those who could much more
easily contain, were it not that piety at that time had another

lust.</p>

18. For what food is unto the
conservation of the man, this sexual intercourse is unto the
conservation of the race: and both are not without carnal delight:

right use of lust is not lust, for as it is evil will to use good
things, so is it good will to use evil things.&#8221;</p></note> But what unlawful food is in the
supporting of life, this sexual intercourse of fornication or
adultery is in the seeking of a family. And what unlawful food is
in luxury of belly and throat, this unlawful intercourse is in lust
that seeks not a family. And what the excessive appetite of some is
in lawful food, this that intercourse that is matter of pardon is
in husband and wife. As therefore it is better to die of hunger
than to eat things offered unto idols: so it is better to die
without children, than to seek a family from unlawful intercourse.
But from whatever source men be born, if they follow not the vices
of their parents, and worship God aright, they shall be honest and
safe. For the seed of man, from out what kind of man soever, is the
creation of God, and it shall fare ill with those who use it ill,
yet shall not, itself at any time be evil. But as the good sons of
adulterers are no defense of adulteries, so the evil sons of
married persons are no charge against marriage. Wherefore as the
Fathers of the time of the New Testament taking food from the duty
of conservation, although they took it with natural delight of the
flesh, were yet in no way compared with the delight of those who
fed on what had been offered in sacrifice, or of those who,
although the food was lawful, yet took it to excess: so the Fathers
of the time of the Old Testament from the duty of conservation used
sexual intercourse; and yet that their natural delight, by no means
relaxed unto unreasonable and unlawful lust, is not to be compared
either with the vileness of fornications, or with the intemperance
of married persons. Forsooth through the same vein<note place="end" n="1985" id="v.ii.xix-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.xix-p3"> &#8220;<i>Vena</i>.&#8221;</p></note> of
charity, now after the spirit, then after the flesh, it was a duty
to beget sons for the sake of that mother Jerusalem: but it was
nought save the difference of times which made the works of the
fathers different. But thus it was necessary that even Prophets,
not living after the flesh, should come together after the flesh;
even as it was necessary that Apostles also, not living after the
flesh, should eat food after the flesh.</p>

compared to the holy women then, even when they married. Marriage
itself indeed in all nations is for the same cause of begetting
sons, and of what character soever these may be afterward, yet was
marriage for this purpose instituted, that they may be born in due
and honest order. But men, who contain not, as it were ascend unto
marriage by a step of honesty: but they, who without doubt would
contain, if the purpose of that time had allowed this, in a certain
measure descended unto marriage by a step of piety. And, on this
account, although the marriages of both, so far as they are
marriages, in that they are for the sake of begetting, are equally
good, yet these men when married are not to be compared with those
men as married. For these have, what is allowed them by the way of
leave, on account of the honesty of marriage, although it pertain
not to marriage; that is, the advance which goes beyond the
necessity of begetting, which they had not. But neither can these,
if haply there be now any found, who neither seek, nor desire, in
marriage any thing, save that wherefore marriage was instituted, be
made equal to those men. For in these the very desire of sons is
carnal, but in those it was spiritual, in that it was suited to the
sacrament of that time. Forsooth now no one who is made perfect in
piety seeks to have sons, save after a spiritual sense; but then it
was the work of piety itself to beget sons even after a carnal
sense: in that the begetting of that people was fraught with
tidings of things to come, and pertained unto the prophetic
dispensation.</p>

when He shall have unveiled the hidden things of darkness,<note place="end" n="1995" id="v.ii.xxii-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.xxii-p9"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 5" id="v.ii.xxii-p9.2" parsed="|1Cor|4|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.5">1 Cor. iv. 5</scripRef></p></note> and shall
have made manifest the thoughts of the heart, that then each may
have praise from God. But now there are manifest, there are hidden,
dissensions, even where charity is safe between those, who shall be
hereafter one, and in one; which shall then certainly have no
existence. As therefore the Sacrament of marriage with several of
that time signified the multitude that should be hereafter made
subject unto God in all nations of the earth, so the Sacrament of
marriage with one of our times signifies the unity of us all made
subject to God, which shall be hereafter in one Heavenly City.
Therefore as to serve two or more, so to pass over from a living
husband into marriage with another, was neither lawful then, nor is
it lawful now, nor will it ever be lawful. Forsooth to apostatise
from the One God, and to go into adulterous superstition of
another, is ever an evil. Therefore not even for the sake of a more
numerous family did our Saints do, what the Roman Cato is said to
have done,<note place="end" n="1996" id="v.ii.xxii-p9.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.xxii-p10"> <i>Cato minor</i>, cf. Plutarch. p. 771.</p></note> to give up
his wife, during his own life, to fill even another&#8217;s house with
sons. Forsooth in the marriage of one woman the sanctity of the
Sacrament is of more avail than the fruitfulness of the
womb.</p>

22. If, therefore, even they
who are united in marriage only for the purpose of begetting, for
which purpose marriage was instituted, are not compared with the
Fathers, seeking their very sons in a way far other than do these;
forasmuch as Abraham, being bidden to slay his son, fearless and
devoted, spared not his only son, whom from out of great despair he
had received<note place="end" n="1997" id="v.ii.xxiii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.xxiii-p2"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xxii. 12" id="v.ii.xxiii-p2.2" parsed="|Gen|22|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.22.12">Gen. xxii. 12</scripRef></p></note> save that
he laid down his hand, when He forbade him, at Whose command he had
lifted it up; it remains that we consider, whether at least
continent persons among us are to be compared to those Fathers who
were married; unless haply now these are to be preferred to them,
to whom we have not yet found persons to compare. For there was a
greater good in their marriage, than is the proper good of
marriage: to which without doubt the good of Continence is to be
preferred: because they sought not sons from marriage by such duty
as these are led by, from a certain sense of mortal nature
requiring succession against decease. And, whoso denies this to be
good he knows not <pb n="409" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_409.html" id="v.ii.xxiii-Page_409"/>God, the Creator of all things
good, from things heavenly even unto things earthly, from things
immortal even unto things mortal. But neither are beasts altogether
without this sense of begetting, and chiefly birds, whose care of
building nests meets us at once, and a certain likeness to
marriages, in order to beget and nurture together. But those men,
with mind far holier, surpassed this affection of mortal nature,
the chastity whereof in its own kind, there being added thereto the
worship of God, as some have understood, is set forth as bearing
first thirty-fold; who sought sons of their marriage for the sake
of Christ; in order to distinguish His race after the flesh from
all nations: even as God was pleased to order, that this above the
rest should avail to prophesy of Him, in that it was foretold of
what race also, and of what nation, He should hereafter come in the
flesh. Therefore it was a far greater good than the chaste
marriages of believers among us, which father Abraham knew in his
own thigh, under which he bade his servant to put his hand, that he
might take an oath concerning the wife, whom his son was to marry.
For putting his hand under the thigh of a man, and swearing by the
God of Heaven,<note place="end" n="1998" id="v.ii.xxiii-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.xxiii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xxiv. 2-4" id="v.ii.xxiii-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|24|2|24|4" osisRef="Bible:Gen.24.2-Gen.24.4">Gen. xxiv. 2&#8211;4</scripRef></p></note> what else
did he signify, than that in that Flesh, which derived its origin
from that thigh, the God of Heaven would come? Therefore marriage
is a good, wherein married persons are so much the better, in
proportion as they fear God with greater chastity and faithfulness,
specially if the sons, whom they desire after the flesh, they also
bring up after the spirit.</p>

23. Nor, in that the Law
orders a man to be purified even after intercourse with a wife,
doth it show it to be sin: unless it be that which is allowed by
way of pardon, which also, being in excess, hinders prayers. But,
as the Law sets<note place="end" n="1999" id="v.ii.xxiv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.xxiv-p2"> <i>Infirmitas</i></p></note> many
things in sacraments and shadows of things to come; a certain as it
were material formless state of the seed, which having received
form will hereafter produce the body of man, is set to signify a
life formless, and untaught: from which formless state, forasmuch
as it behoves that man be cleansed by form and teaching of
learning; as a sign of this, that purification was ordered after
the emission of seed. For neither in sleep also doth it take place
through sin. And yet there also a purification was commanded. Or,
if any think this also to be sin, thinking that it comes not to
pass save from some lust of this kind, which without doubt is
false; what? are the ordinary menses also of women sins? And yet
from these the same old Law commanded that they should be cleansed
by expiation; for no other cause, save the material formless state
itself, in that which, when conception hath taken place, is added
as it were to build up the body, and for this reason, when it flows
without form, the Law would have signified by it a soul without
form of discipline, flowing and loose in an unseemly manner. And
that this ought to receive form, it signifies, when it commands
such flow of the body to be purified. Lastly, what? to die, is that
also a sin? or, to bury a dead person, is it not also a good work
of humanity? and yet a purification was commanded even on occasion
of this also; because also a dead body, life abandoning it, is not
sin, but signifies the sin of a soul abandoned by righteousness.<note place="end" n="2000" id="v.ii.xxiv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.xxiv-p3"> <scripRef passage="Numb. xix. 11" id="v.ii.xxiv-p3.2" parsed="|Num|19|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Num.19.11">Numb. xix. 11</scripRef></p></note></p>

24. Marriage, I say, is a
good, and may be, by sound reason, defended against all calumnies.
But with the marriage of the holy fathers, I inquire not what
marriage, but what continence, is on a level: or rather not
marriage with marriage; for it is an equal gift in all cases given
to the mortal nature of men; but men who use marriage, forasmuch as
I find not, to compare with other men who used marriage in a far
other spirit, we must require what continent persons admit of being
compared with those married persons. Unless, haply, Abraham could
not contain from marriage, for the sake of the kingdom of heaven,

25. Forsooth continence is a
virtue, not of the body, but of the soul. But the virtues of the
soul are sometimes shown in work, sometimes lie hid in habit, as
the virtue of martyrdom shone forth and appeared by enduring
sufferings; but how many are there of the same virtue of mind, unto
whom trial is wanting, whereby what is within, in the sight of God,
may go forth also into the sight of men, and not to men begin to
exist, but only become known? For there was already in Job
patience, which God knew, and to which He bore witness: but it
became known unto men by test of trial:<note place="end" n="2001" id="v.ii.xxvi-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.xxvi-p2"> <scripRef passage="Job 1.8" id="v.ii.xxvi-p2.1" parsed="|Job|1|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.1.8">Job i. 8</scripRef></p></note> and what lay hid within was not
produced, but shown, by the things that were brought on him from
without. Timothy also certainly had the virtue of abstaining from
wine,<note place="end" n="2002" id="v.ii.xxvi-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.xxvi-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 23" id="v.ii.xxvi-p3.2" parsed="|1Tim|5|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.23">1 Tim. v. 23</scripRef></p></note> which Paul
took not from him, by advising him to use a moderate portion of
wine, &#8220;for the sake of his stomach and his often infirmities,&#8221;
otherwise he taught him a deadly lesson, that for the sake of the
health <pb n="410" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_410.html" id="v.ii.xxvi-Page_410"/>of the body there should be a loss of virtue in the
soul: but because what he advised could take place with safety to
that virtue, the profit of drinking was so left free to the body,
as that the habit of continence continued in the soul. For it is
the habit itself, whereby any thing is done, when there is need;<note place="end" n="2003" id="v.ii.xxvi-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.xxvi-p4"> Or &#8220;work.&#8221;</p></note> but when
it is not done, it can be done, only there is no need. This habit,
in the matter of that continence which is from sexual intercourse,
they have not, unto whom it is said, &#8220;If they contain not, let
them be married.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2004" id="v.ii.xxvi-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.xxvi-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 9" id="v.ii.xxvi-p5.2" parsed="|1Cor|7|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.9">1 Cor. vii. 9</scripRef></p></note> But this they have, unto whom it

perfect souls used earthly goods, that are necessary for something
else, through this habit of continence, so as, by it, not to be
bound by them, and so as by it, to have power also not to use them,
in case there were no need. Nor doth any use them well, save who
hath power also not to use them. Many indeed with more ease
practise abstinence, so as not to use, than practise temperance, so
as to use well. But no one can wisely use them, save who can also
continently not use them. From this habit Paul also said, &#8220;I know

26. But, in order that it may
be more clearly understood, how there may be virtue in habit,
although it be not in work, I speak of an example, about which no
Catholic Christian can doubt. For that our Lord Jesus Christ in
truth of flesh hungered and thirsted, ate and drank, no one doubts
of such as out of the Gospel are believers. What, then, was there
not in Him the virtue of continence from meat and drink, as great
as in John Baptist? &#8220;For John came neither eating nor drinking;
and they said, He hath a devil; the Son of Man came both eating and

for Himself saith most plainly and truly, &#8220;John came, not eating,
nor drinking; the Son of Man came eating and drinking:&#8221; so
neither is this true in these Fathers; although there hath come now
the Apostle of Christ, not wedded, nor begetting, so that the
heathen say of him, He was a magician; but there came then the
Prophet of Christ, marrying and begetting sons, so that the
Manichees say of him, He was a man fond of women: &#8220;And wisdom,&#8221;

even in the habit of the soul, but to be shown forth in deed,
according to opportunity of things and times; even as the virtue of
patience of holy martyrs appeared in deed; but of the rest equally
holy was in habit. Wherefore, even as there is not unequal desert
of patience in Peter, who suffered, and in John, who suffered not;
so there is not unequal desert of continence in John who made no
trial of marriage,<note place="end" n="2009" id="v.ii.xxvii-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.xxvii-p4"> S. Jerome agt.

For both the celibate of the one, and the marriage estate of the
other, did service as soldiers to Christ, as times were allotted;

alone.</p>

a Christian man exercising continence, and refusing marriage, What
then, are you better than Abraham? But let him not, upon hearing
this, be troubled; neither let him dare to say, &#8220;Better,&#8221; nor
let him fall away from his purpose: for the one he saith not truly,
the other he doth not rightly. But let him say, I indeed am not
better than Abraham, but the chastity of the unmarried is better
than the chastity of marriage; whereof Abraham had one in use, both
in habit. For he lived chastely in the marriage state: but it was
in his power to be chaste without marriage, but at that time it
behoved not. But I with more ease use not marriage, <pb n="411" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_411.html" id="v.ii.xxviii-Page_411"/>which
Abraham used, than so use marriage as Abraham used it: and
therefore I am better than those, who through incontinence of mind
cannot do what I do; not than those, who, on account of difference
of time, did not do what I do. For what I now do, they would have
done better, if it had been to be done at that time; but what they
did, I should not so do, although it were now to be done. Or, if he
feels and knows himself to be such, as that, (the virtue of
continence being preserved and continued in the habit of his mind,
in case he had descended unto the use of marriage from some duty of
religion,) he should be such an husband, and such a father, as
Abraham was; let him dare to make plain answer to that captious
questioner, and to say, I am not indeed better than Abraham, only
in this kind of continence, of which he was not void, although it
appeared not: but I am such, not having other than he, but doing
other. Let him say this plainly: forasmuch as, even if he shall
wish to glory, he will not be a fool, for he saith the truth. But
if he spare, lest any think of him above what he sees him,<note place="end" n="2014" id="v.ii.xxviii-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ii.xxviii-p6"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 6" id="v.ii.xxviii-p6.2" parsed="|2Cor|12|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.6">2 Cor. xii. 6</scripRef></p></note> or hears
any thing of him; let him remove from his own person the knot of
the question, and let him answer, not concerning the man, but
concerning the thing itself, and let him say, Whoso hath so great
power is such as Abraham. But it may happen that the virtue of
continence is less in his mind, who uses not marriage, which
Abraham used: but yet it is greater than in his mind, who on this
account held chastity of marriage, in that he could not a greater.
Thus also let the unmarried woman, whose thoughts are of the things

shall have heard that shameless questioner saying, What, then, are
you better than Sara? answer, I am better, but than those, who are

28. Therefore, if we compare
the things themselves, we may no way doubt that the chastity of
continence is better than marriage chastity, whilst yet both are
good: but when we compare the persons, he is better, who hath a
greater good than another. Further, he who hath a greater of the
same kind, hath also that which is less; but he, who only hath what
is less, assuredly hath not that which is greater. For in sixty,
thirty also are contained, not sixty also in thirty. But not to
work from out that which he hath, stands in the allotment of
duties, not in the want of virtues: forasmuch as neither is he
without the good of mercy, who finds not wretched persons such as
he may mercifully assist.</p>

29. And there is this
further, that men are not rightly compared with men in regard of
some one good. For it may come to pass, that one hath not what
another hath, but hath another thing, which must be esteemed of
more value. The good of obedience is better than of continence. For
marriage is in no place condemned by authority of our Scriptures,
but disobedience is in no place acquitted. If therefore there be
set before us a virgin about to continue so, but yet disobedient,
and a married woman who could not continue a virgin, but yet
obedient, which shall we call better? shall it be (the one) less
praiseworthy, than if she were a virgin, or (the other) worthy of
blame, even as she is a virgin? So, if you compare a drunken virgin
with a sober married woman, who can doubt to pass the same
sentence? Forsooth marriage and virginity are two goods, whereof
the one is greater; but sobriety and drunkenness, even as obedience
and stubbornness, are, the one good, and the other evil. But it is
better to have all goods even in a less degree, than great good
with great evil: forasmuch as in the goods of the body also it is
better to have the stature of Zacch&#230;us with sound health, than
that of Goliah with fever.</p>

30. The right question
plainly is, not whether a virgin every way disobedient is to be
compared to an obedient married woman, but a less obedient to a
more obedient: forasmuch as that also of marriage is chastity, and
therefore a good, but less than virginal. Therefore if the one, by
so much less in the good of obedience, as she is greater in the
good of chastity, be compared with the other, which of them is to
be preferred that person judges, who in the first place comparing
chastity itself and obedience, sees that obedience is in a certain
way the mother of all virtues. And therefore, for this reason,
there may be obedience without virginity, because virginity is of
counsel, not of precept. But I call that obedience, whereby
precepts are complied with. And, therefore, there may be obedience
to precepts without virginity, but not without chastity. For it
pertains unto chastity, not to commit fornication, not to commit
adultery, to be defiled by no unlawful intercourse: and whoso
observe not these, do contrary to the precepts of God, and on this
account are banished from the virtue of obedience. But there may be
vir<pb n="412" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_412.html" id="v.ii.xxxi-Page_412"/>ginity without obedience, on this account, because it is
possible for a woman, having received the counsel of virginity, and
having guarded virginity, to slight precepts: even as we have known
many sacred virgins, talkative, curious, drunken, litigious,
covetous, proud: all which are contrary to precepts, and slay one,
even as Eve herself, by the crime of disobedience. Wherefore not
only is the obedient to be preferred to the disobedient, but a more
obedient married woman to a less obedient virgin.</p>

in virtue of obedience inferior: even if there had been wanting to
those men in habit of mind also, what is plain in the deed of the

is such, as that, if in it there hath taken place through carnal
intercourse aught which exceeds necessity of begetting, although in
a way that deserves pardon, there is pollution. For what doth
pardon expiate, if that advance cause no pollution whatever? From

32. Therefore the good of
marriage throughout all nations and all men stands in the occasion
of begetting, and faith of chastity: but, so far as pertains unto
the People of God, also in the sanctity of the Sacrament, by reason
of which it is unlawful for one who leaves her husband, even when
she has been put away, to be married to another, so long as her
husband lives, no not even for the sake of bearing children: and,
whereas this is the alone cause, wherefore marriage takes place,
not even where that very thing, wherefore it takes place, follows
not, is the marriage bond loosed, save by the death of the husband
or wife. In like manner as if there take place an ordination of
clergy in order to form a congregation of people, although the
congregation of people follow not, yet there remains in the
ordained persons the Sacrament of Ordination; and if, for any
fault, any be removed from his office, he will not be without the
Sacrament of the Lord once for all set upon him, albeit continuing
unto condemnation. Therefore that marriage takes place for the sake
of begetting children, the Apostle is a witness thus, &#8220;I will,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;that the younger women be married.&#8221; And, as though it
were said to him, For what purpose? straightway he added, &#8220;to
have children, to be mothers of families.&#8221; But unto the faith of
chastity pertains that saying, &#8220;The wife hath not power of her

obedience fall not short in any matter: and this virtue, as the
root-virtue, and (as it is wont to be called) the womb, and clearly

Continence they possessed in habit of mind. Who assuredly, through
that obedience, whereby they were just and holy, and ever prepared

could they, at the <pb n="413" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_413.html" id="v.ii.xxxiii-Page_413"/>bidding or exhortation of God,
not use sexual intercourse, who, as an act of obedience, could slay
the child, for the begetting of which alone they used the ministry
of sexual intercourse?</p>

men, who, on the death of their wives, or, women, who, on the death
of their husbands, or both, who, with mutual consent, have vowed
continence unto God, know that to them indeed there is due a
greater recompense than marriage chastity demands; but, (as
regards) the marriages of the holy Fathers, who were joined after
the manner of prophecy, who neither in sexual intercourse sought
aught save children, nor in children themselves aught save what

2. This we have undertaken in
our present discourse: may Christ help us, the Son of a virgin, and

purity consult we for, if she is not a virgin? or whose children
address we, if she is not a mother? Mary bare the Head of This Body
after the flesh, the Church bears the members of that Body after
the Spirit. In both virginity hinders not fruitfulness: in both
fruitfulness takes not away virginity. Wherefore, whereas the whole
Church is holy both in body and spirit, and yet the whole is not
virgin in body but in spirit; how much

that being of kin? Thus also her nearness as a Mother would have

4. Her virginity also itself
was on this account more pleasing and accepted, in that it was not
that Christ being conceived in her, rescued it beforehand from a
husband who would violate it, Himself to preserve it; but, before
He was conceived, chose it, already dedicated to God, as that from
which to be born. This is shown by the words which Mary spake in
answer to the Angel announcing to her her conception; &#8220;How,&#8221;
saith she, &#8220;shall this be, seeing I know not a man?&#8221;<note place="end" n="2031" id="v.iii.v-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii.v-p2"> <scripRef passage="Luke i. 34" id="v.iii.v-p2.2" parsed="|Luke|1|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.1.34">Luke i. 34</scripRef></p></note> Which
assuredly she would not say, unless she had before vowed herself
unto God as a virgin. But, because the habits of the Israelites as
yet refused this, she was espoused to a just man, who would not
take from her by violence, but rather guard against violent
persons, what she had already vowed. Although, even if she had said
this only, &#8220;How shall this take place?&#8221; and had not added,
&#8220;seeing I know not a man,&#8221; certainly she would not have asked,
how, being a female, she should give birth to her promised Son, if
she had married with purpose of sexual intercourse. She might have
been bidden also to continue a virgin, that in her by fitting
miracle the Son of God should receive the form of a servant, but,
being to be a pattern to holy virgins, lest it should be thought
that she alone needed to be a virgin, who had obtained to conceive
a child even without sexual intercourse, she dedicated her
virginity to God, when as yet she knew not what she should
conceive, in order that the imitation of a heavenly life in an
earthly and mortal body should take place of vow, not of command;
through love of choosing, not through necessity of doing service.
Thus Christ by being born of a virgin, who, before she knew Who was
to be born of her, had determined to continue a virgin, chose
rather to approve, than to command, holy virginity. And thus, even
in the female herself, in whom He took the form of a servant, He
willed that virginity should be free.</p>

5. There is, therefore, no
reason why the virgins of God be sad, because themselves also
cannot, keeping their virginity, be mothers of the flesh. For Him
alone could virginity give birth to with fitting propriety, Who in
His Birth could have no peer. However, That Birth of the Holy
Virgin is the ornament of all holy virgins; and themselves together
with Mary are mothers of Christ, if they do the will of His Father.
For Mary also is on this account the Mother of Christ in a way more
full of praise and blessing, according to His sentence mentioned
above. &#8220;Whosoever doeth the will of my Father Who is in heaven,
that one is to Me brother, and sister, and mother.&#8221; All these
degrees of nearness of kin to Himself, He shows forth in a
spiritual manner, in the People whom He hath redeemed: as brothers
and sisters He hath holy men and holy women, forasmuch as they all
are co-heirs in the heavenly inheritance. His mother is the whole
Church, because she herself assuredly gives birth to His members,
that is, His faithful ones. Also His mother is every pious soul,
doing the will of His Father with most fruitful charity, in them of
whom it travaileth, until Himself<note place="end" n="2032" id="v.iii.vi-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii.vi-p2"> <scripRef passage="Gal. iv. 19" id="v.iii.vi-p2.2" parsed="|Gal|4|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.4.19">Gal. iv. 19</scripRef></p></note> be formed in them. Mary,

clearly the mother of His members, which are we: in that she
wrought together by charity, that faithful ones should be born in
the Church, who are members of That Head: but in the flesh, the
mother of the Head Himself. For it behoved that our Head, on
account of a notable miracle, should be born after the flesh of a
virgin, that He might thereby signify that His members would be
born after the Spirit, of the Church a virgin: therefore Mary alone
both in Spirit and in flesh is a mother and a virgin: both the
mother of Christ, and a virgin of Christ; but the Church, in the
Saints who shall possess the kingdom of God, in the Spirit indeed
is altogether the mother of Christ, altogether a virgin of Christ:
but in the flesh not altogether, but in certain a virgin of Christ,

7. I have said this, lest
haply married fruitfulness dare to vie with virgin chastity, and to
set forth Mary herself, and to say unto the virgins of God, She had
in her flesh two things worthy of honor, virginity and
fruitfulness; inasmuch as she both continued a virgin, and bore:
this happiness, since we could not both have the whole, we have
divided, that ye be virgins, we be mothers: for what is wanting to
you in children, let your virginity, that hath been preserved, be a
consolation: for us, let the gain of children make up for our lost
virginity. This speech of faithful women married, unto holy
virgins, would any how be to be endured, if they gave birth to
Christians in the flesh; that in this alone, save virginity, the
fruitfulness of Mary in the flesh should be more excellent, that
she gave birth to the Head Himself of these members, but they to
the members of That Head: but now, although by this speech there
vie such as on this one account wed and have intercourse with
husbands, that they may have sons, and have no other thought of
their sons, than to gain them for Christ, and do this so soon as
they can: yet are not Christians born of their flesh, but made so
afterwards: the Church giving them birth, through this, that in a
spiritual manner she is the mother of the members of Christ, of
Whom also after a spiritual manner she is the virgin. And unto this
holy birth mothers also who have not borne in the flesh Christians,
are workers together, that they may become what they know that they
could not give birth to in the flesh: yet are they workers together
through this, wherein themselves also are virgins and mothers<note place="end" n="2036" id="v.iii.viii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii.viii-p2"> It has been proposed to omit

8. Therefore no fruitfulness
of the flesh can be compared to holy virginity even of the flesh.
For neither is itself also honored because it is virginity, but
because it hath been dedicated to God, and, although it be kept in
the flesh, yet is it kept by religion and devotion of the Spirit.
And by this means even virginity of body is spiritual, which
continence of piety vows and keeps. For, even as no one makes an
immodest use of the body, unless the sin have been before conceived
in the spirit, so no one keeps modesty in the body, unless chastity
have been before implanted in the spirit. But, further, if modesty
of married life, although it be guarded in the flesh, is yet
attributed to the soul, not to the flesh, under the rule and
guidance of which, the flesh itself hath no intercourse with any
beside its own proper estate of marriage; how much more, and with
how much greater honor, are we to reckon among the goods of the
soul that continence, whereby the virgin purity of the flesh is
vowed, consecrated, and kept, for the Creator Himself of the soul
and flesh.</p>

9. Wherefore neither are we to
believe that their fruitfulness of the flesh, who at this time seek
in marriage nothing else save children, to make over unto Christ,
can be set against the loss of virginity. Forsooth, in former
times, unto Christ about to come after the flesh, the race itself
of the flesh was needful, in a certain large and prophetic nation:
but now, when from out every race of men, and from out all nations,
members of Christ may be gathered unto the People of God, and City
of the kingdom of heaven, whoso can receive sacred virginity, let
him receive it; and let her only, who contains not, be married.<note place="end" n="2038" id="v.iii.x-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii.x-p2"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 12" id="v.iii.x-p2.2" parsed="|Matt|19|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.12">Matt. xix. 12</scripRef>; <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 9" id="v.iii.x-p2.3" parsed="|1Cor|7|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.9">1 Cor.

she not provide for the giving birth to members of Christ in a
manner more rich, and more numerous, than by any, how great soever,
fruitfulness of the womb? And yet she will not therefore dare to
compare her money to the offering<note place="end" n="2039" id="v.iii.x-p2.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii.x-p3"> <i>Muneri</i></p></note> of holy virginity. But if for the
sake of making such as shall be born Christians, fruitfulness of
the flesh shall with just reason be set against the loss of
chastity, this matter will be more fruitful, if virginity be lost
at a great price of money, whereby many more children may be
purchased to be made Christians, than could be born from the womb,
however fruitful, of a single person. But, if it be extreme folly
to say this, let the faithful women that are married possess their
own good, of which we have treated, so far as seemed fit, in
another volume; and let them more highly honor, even as they are
most rightly used to do, in the sacred virgins, their better good,
of which we are treating in our present discourse.</p>

such as are married to compare themselves with the deserts of the

whether in due order and honest, or base and unlawful, there is
born no female save a virgin, yet is none born a sacred virgin: so

11. Nor do we ourselves set
forth this in virgins, that they are virgins; but that they are
virgins dedicated unto God by pious continence. For it is not at a
venture that I may say, a married woman seems to me happier than a
virgin about to be married: for the one hath what the other as yet
desires, especially if she be not yet even the betrothed of any
one. The one studies to please one, unto whom she hath been given;
the other many, in doubt unto whom she is to be given: by this one
thing she guards modesty of thought from the crowd, that she is
seeking, not an adulterer, but a husband, in the crowd. Therefore
that virgin is with good reason set before a married woman, who
neither sets herself forth for the multitude to love, whereas she

their own good, not that they beget sons, but that honestly, that
lawfully, that modestly, that in a spirit of fellowship they beget
them, and educate them, after they have been begotten, with
cooperation, with wholesome teaching, and earnest purpose: in that
they keep the faith of the couch one with another; in that they
violate not the sacrament of wedlock. All these, however, are
offices of human duty: but virginal chastity and freedom through

14. It is, therefore, the
present necessity that we are to avoid, but yet such as is a
hindrance to somewhat of the good things to come; by which
necessity the married life is forced to have thought of the things
of the world, how to please, the husband the wife or the wife the
husband. Not that these separate from the kingdom of God, as there
are sins, which are restrained by command, not by counsel, on this
account, because it is matter of condemnation not to obey the Lord
when He commands: but that, which, within the kingdom of God
itself, might be more largely possessed, if there were larger
thoughts how they were to please God, will assuredly be less, when
as this very thing is less thought of by necessity of marriage.
Therefore he says, &#8220;Concerning virgins I have not command of the
Lord.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2047" id="v.iii.xv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii.xv-p2"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 25" id="v.iii.xv-p2.2" parsed="|1Cor|7|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.25">1 Cor. vii. 25</scripRef></p></note> For

Wherefore, because it is not sin to marry a wife or to be married,
(but if it were a sin, it would be forbidden by a &#8220;Command,&#8221;)
on this account there is no &#8220;Command&#8221; of the Lord concerning
virgins. But since, after we have shunned or had forgiveness of
sins, we must approach eternal life, wherein is a certain or more
excellent glory, to be assigned not unto all who shall live for
ever, but unto certain there; in order to obtain which it is not
enough to have been set free from sins, unless there be vowed unto
Him, Who setteth us free, something, which it is no matter of fault
not to have vowed, but matter of praise to have vowed and
performed; he saith, &#8220;I give counsel, as having obtained mercy
from God that I should be faithful.&#8221; For neither ought I to

through any fault of her own, but of her husband. Then he saith,
&#8220;And let not the man put away his wife,&#8221; which, nevertheless,
he set down of command of the Lord: nor did he then add, And, if he
shall have put her away, he sinneth not. For this is a command, not
to obey which is sin: not a counsel, which if you shall be
unwilling to use, you will obtain less good, not do any ill. On
this account, after he had said, &#8220;Thou art loosed from a wife,
seek not a wife;&#8221; because he was not giving command, in order

for the having of marriage, now at this time, wherein there is no
service done unto Christ about to come through descent of flesh by
the begetting of the family itself, to take upon one to bear that
tribulation of the flesh, which the Apostle foretells to such as
shall be married, would be extremely foolish, did not incontinent
persons fear, lest, through the temptation of Satan, they should
fall into damnable sins. But whereas he says that he spares them,
who he saith will have tribulation of the flesh, there suggests
itself to me in the mean while no sounder interpretation, than that
he was unwilling to open, and unfold in words, this self-same
tribulation of the flesh which he fore-announced to those who
choose marriage, in suspicions of jealousy of married life, in the
begetting and nurture of children, in fears and sorrows of
childlessness. For how very few, after they have bound themselves
with the bonds of marriage, are not drawn and driven to and fro by
these feelings? And this we ought not to exaggerate, lest we spare

the Spirit of God.&#8221; This is the doctrine of the Lord, this of the
Apostles, this true, this sound, so to choose greater gifts, as
that the lesser be not condemned. The truth of God, in the
Scripture of God, is better than virginity of man in the mind or
flesh of any. Let what is chaste be so loved, as that what is true
be not denied. For what evil thought may they not have even
concerning their own flesh, who believe that the tongue of the
Apostle, in that very place, wherein he was commending virginity of
body, was not virgin from corruption of lying. In the first place,
therefore, and chiefly, let such as choose the good of virginity,
hold most firmly that the holy Scriptures have in nothing spoken
lies; and, thus, that that also is true which is said, &#8220;And if
thou shall have taken a wife, thou hast not sinned; and, if a
virgin shall have been married, she sinneth not.&#8221; And let them
not think that the so great good of virgin chastity is made less,
if marriage shall not be an evil. Yea rather, let her hence feel
confident, rather, that there is prepared for her a palm of greater
glory, who feared not to be condemned, in case she were married,
but desired to receive a more honorable crown, in that she was not
married. Whoso therefore shall be willing to abide without
marriage, let them not flee from marriage as a pitfall of sin; but
let them surmount it as a hill of the lesser good, in order that
they may rest in the mountain of the greater, continence. It is on
this condition, forsooth, that this hill is dwelt on; that one
leave it not when he will. For, &#8220;a woman is bound, so long as her
husband liveth.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2055" id="v.iii.xix-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii.xix-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 39" id="v.iii.xix-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|7|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.39">1 Cor. vii. 39</scripRef></p></note> However unto widowed continence

who so far from making marriage equal to perpetual virginity,
altogether condemned it. For whereas both are errors, either to
equal marriage to holy virginity, or to condemn it: by fleeing from
one another to excess, these two errors come into open collision,
in that they have been unwilling to hold the mean of truth:
whereby, both by sure reason and authority of holy Scriptures, we
both discover that marriage is not a sin, and yet equal it not to
the good either of virginal or even of widowed chastity. Some
forsooth by aiming at virginity, have thought marriage hateful even
as adultery: but others, by defending marriage, would have the
excellence of perpetual continence to deserve nothing more than
married chastity; as though either the good of Susanna be the
lowering of Mary: or the greater good of Mary ought to be the
condemnation of Susanna.</p>

20. Far be it, therefore,
that the Apostle so said, unto such as are married or are about to
marry, &#8220;But I spare you,&#8221; as if he were unwilling to say what
punishment is due to the married in another life. Far be it that
she, whom Daniel set free from temporal judgment, be cast by Paul
into hell! Far be it that her husband&#8217;s bed be unto her
punishment before the judgment seat of Christ, keeping faith to
which she chose, under false charge of adultery, to meet either
danger, or death! To what effect that speech, &#8220;It is better for

been about, not to set her free because she kept married chastity,
but to condemn her because she had married? And now so often as
married chastity is by truth of holy Scripture justified against
such as bring calumnies and charges against marriage, so often is
Susanna by the Holy Spirit defended against false witnesses, so
often is she set free from a false charge, and with much greater
ado. For then against one married woman, now against all; then of
hidden and untrue adultery, now of true and open marriage, an
accusation is laid. Then one woman, upon what the unjust elders
said, now all husbands and wives, upon what the Apostle would not
say, are accused. It was, forsooth, your condemnation, say they,

21. Here some one will say,
What has this to do with holy virginity, or perpetual continence,
the setting forth of which was undertaken in this discourse? To
whom I make answer in the first place, what I mentioned above, that
the glory of that greater good is greater from the fact that, in
order to obtain it, the good of married life is surmounted, not the
sin of marriage shunned. Otherwise it would be enough for perpetual
continence, not to be specially praised, but only not to be blamed:
if it were maintained on this account, because it was a crime to
wed. In the next place, because it is not by human judgment, but by
authority of Divine Scripture, that men must be exhorted unto so
excellent a gift, we must plead not in a common-place manner, or
merely by the way, that divine Scripture itself seem not to any one
in any matter to have lied. For they discourage rather than exhort
holy virgins, who compel them to continue so by passing sentence on
marriage. For whence can they feel sure that that is true, which is
written, &#8220;And he, who gives her not in marriage, does
better:&#8221;<note place="end" n="2060" id="v.iii.xxii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii.xxii-p2"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 38" id="v.iii.xxii-p2.2" parsed="|1Cor|7|38|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.38">1 Cor. vii. 38</scripRef></p></note> if they
think that false, which yet is written close above, &#8220;Both he, who
gives his virgin, does well?&#8221; But, if they shall without all
doubt have believed Scripture speaking of the good of marriage,
confirmed by the same most true authority of the divine oracle,
they will hasten beyond unto their own better part with
glow<pb n="424" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_424.html" id="v.iii.xxii-Page_424"/>ing and confident eagerness. Wherefore we have already
spoken enough for the business which we have taken in hand, and, so
far as we could, have shown, that neither that saying of the
Apostle, &#8220;But I think that this is good by reason of the present
necessity,&#8221;<note place="end" n="2061" id="v.iii.xxii-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.iii.xxii-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 26" id="v.iii.xxii-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|7|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.26">1 Cor. vii. 26</scripRef></p></note> is so to
be understood, as though in this life holy virgins are better than

so understood, as though he chose rather to be silent on, than to
speak of, the sin and condemnation of marriage. Forsooth two
errors, contrary the one to the other, have, through not
understanding them, taken hold of each one of these two sentences.
For that concerning the present necessity they interpret in their
own favor, who contend to equal such as wed to such as wed not: but
this, where it is said, &#8220;But I spare you,&#8221; they who presume to
condemn such as wed. But we, according to the faith and sound
doctrine of holy Scriptures, both say that marriage is no sin, and
yet set its good not only below virginal, but also below widowed
continence; and say that the present necessity of married persons
is an hindrance to their desert, not indeed unto life eternal, but
unto an excellent glory and honor, which is reserved for perpetual
continence: and that at this time marriage is not expedient save
for such as contain not; and that on the tribulation of the flesh,
which cometh from the affection of the flesh, without which
marriages of incontinent persons cannot be, the Apostle neither
wished to be silent, as forewarning what was true, nor to unfold
more fully, as sparing man&#8217;s weakness.</p>

measure of our memory we shall be able to remember, let it more
clearly appear, that, not on account of the present life of this

Lord Himself delivering most plain judgment on this matter. For,

concerning these, who make themselves eunuchs for the sake of the
kingdom of heaven? For for these, whose bodily organ is without
strength, so that they cannot beget, (such as are the eunuchs of
rich men and of kings,) it is surely enough, when they become
Christians, and keep the commands of God, yet have this purpose,
that, if they could, they would have wives, to be made equal to the
rest of the faithful in the house of God, who are married, who
bring up in the fear of God a family which they have lawfully and
chastely gotten, teaching their sons to set their hope on God; but
not to receive a <i>better</i> place than of sons and daughters.
For it is not of virtue of the soul, but of necessity of the flesh,
that they marry not wives. Let who will contend that the Prophet
foretold this of those eunuchs who have suffered mutilation of
body; that even also helps the cause which we have undertaken. For
God hath not preferred these eunuchs to such as have no place in
His house, but assuredly to those who keep the desert of married
life in begetting sons. For, when He saith, &#8220;I will give unto
them a place much better;&#8221; He shows that one is also given unto
the married, but much inferior. Therefore, to allow that in the
house of God there will be the eunuchs after the flesh spoken of
above, who were not in the People of Israel: because we see that
these also themselves, whereas they become not Jews, yet become
Christians: and that the Prophet spake not of them, who through
purpose of continence seeking not marriage, make themselves eunuchs
for the sake of the kingdom of heaven: is any one so madly opposed
to the truth as to believe that eunuchs made so in the flesh have a
better place than married persons in the house of God, and to
contend that persons being of pious purpose continent, chastening
the body even unto contempt of marriage, making themselves eunuchs,
not in the body, but in the very root of concupiscence, practising
an heavenly and angelic life in an earthly mortal state, are on a
level with the deserts of the married; and, being a Christian, to
gainsay Christ when He praises those who have made themselves
eunuchs, not for the sake of this world, but for the sake of the
kingdom of heaven, affirming that this is of use for the present
life, not for a future? What else remains for these, save to assert
that the kingdom of heaven itself pertains unto this temporal life,
wherein we now are? For why should not blind presumption advance
even to this madness? And what more full of phrensy than this
assertion? For, although at times the Church, even that which is at
this time, is called the kingdom of heaven; certainly it is so
called for this end, because it is being gathered together for a
future and eternal life. Although, therefore, it have the promise
of the present, and of a future life, yet in all its good works it
looks not to &#8220;the things that are seen, but to what are not seen.
For what are seen are temporal; but what are not seen, are

as are not virgins, although of Christ. For there are to different
persons different joys, but to none such. Go (enter) into these,
follow the Lamb, because the Flesh of the Lamb also is assuredly

by a Virgin road, how shall they go after Him, who have lost what
there is no way for them to recover? Do ye, therefore, do ye go
after Him, His virgins; do ye thither also go after Him, in that on
this one account whithersoever He shall have gone, ye follow Him:

Him, we can exhort married persons, save this which they have lost

yielding, that the fine network below appears: unto these we must

fruitfulness be ascribed unto martyrdom, the sixty-fold unto
continence, the thirty-fold unto marriage; or whether virginity, by
the addition of martyrdom, fill up the hundred-fold, but when alone
be in sixty-fold, but married persons bearing thirty-fold arrive at
sixty-fold, in case they shall be martyrs: or whether, what seems
to me more probable, forasmuch as the gifts of Divine grace are
many, and one is greater and better than another, whence the

understand that they are more in number than to allow of being
distributed under those different kinds. In the first place, that
we set not widowed continence either as bearing no fruit, or set it
but level with the desert of married charity, or equal it unto
virgin glory; or think that the Crown of Martyrdom, either
established in habit of mind, although proof of trial be wanting,
or in actual making trial of suffering, be added unto either one of
those these chastities, without any increase of fruitfulness. Next,
when we set it down that many men and women so keep virginal
chastity, as that yet they do not the things which the Lord saith,

addition of fruitfulness unto the virgins of God, when they do
this? or that the virgins of God are without any fruit, although

fruitful in fewer gifts, but better; another in lower gifts, but
more. And in what manner they be either made equal one to another,
or distinguished one from another, in receiving eternal honors, who
of men would dare to pronounce? whereas yet it is plain both that
those differences are many, and that the better are profitable not
for the present time, but for eternity. But I judge that the Lord
willed to make mention of three differences <pb n="435" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_435.html" id="v.iii.xlvii-Page_435"/>of

47. But, as I had begun to
say, whether the fruit an hundred-fold be virginity dedicated to
God, or whether we are to understand that interval of fruitfulness
in some other way, either such as we have made mention of, or such
as we have not made mention of; yet no one, as I suppose, will have
dared to prefer virginity to martyrdom, and no one will have
doubted that this latter gift is hidden, if trial to test it be
wanting. A virgin, therefore, hath a subject for thought, such as
may be of profit to her for the keeping of humility, that she
violate not that charity, which is above all gifts, without which
assuredly whatever other gifts she shall have had, whether few or
many, whether great or small, she is nothing. She hath, I say, a
subject for thought, that she be not puffed up, that she rival not;
forsooth that she so make profession that the virginal good is much
greater and better than the married good, as that yet she know not
whether this or that married woman be not already able to suffer
for Christ, but herself as yet unable, and she herein spared, that
her weakness is not put to the question by trial. &#8220;For God,&#8221;
saith the Apostle, &#8220;is faithful, Who will not suffer you to be

women keeping a way of married life praiseworthy in its kind, are
already able, against an enemy forcing to unrighteousness, to
contend even by tearing in pieces of bowels, and shedding of blood;
but these men or women, continent from childhood, and making
themselves eunuchs for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven, still are
not as yet able to endure such, either for righteousness, or for
chastity itself. For it is one thing, for truth and an holy
purpose, not to consent unto one who would persuade and flatter,
but another thing not to yield even to one who tortures and
strikes. These lie hid in the powers and strength of souls, by
trial they are unfolded, by actual essay they come forth. In order,
therefore, that each be not puffed up by reason of that, which he
sees clearly that he can do, let him humbly consider that he knows
not that there is perchance something more excellent which he
cannot do, but that some, who neither have nor profess that of
which he is lawfully self-conscious, are able to do this, which he
himself cannot do. Thus will be kept, not by feigned but by true

its disagreement with the fourth Council of Carthage, an. 398. can.

consecration, and pronounces them guilty of adultery, whereas in
cap. 10 and 11, the opinion that such marriages are no marriages,
and that they ought to return to continence, is refuted. The two,
however, are not wholly irreconcileable, as there may be a guilt
similar to that of adultery incurred, and it may be visited with a
censure in the form of excommunication, and yet the marriage may
remain valid. The 16th Canon of Chalcedon imposes such a penalty,
with power to the Bishop to relax it.&#8212;<i>Abridged from the

Christ. Forsooth the same Apostle says, &#8220;For, as in one body we
have many members, but all members have not the same course of
action; so being many we are one body in Christ, and each members
one of another: having gifts diverse according unto the grace,

second marriages are not condemned, but are set in lower honor.
For, even as the good of holy virginity, which thy daughter hath
chosen, doth not condemn thy one marriage; so neither doth thy
widowhood the second marriage of any. For hence, specially, the
heresies of the Cataphryges and of the Novatians swelled, which

of thy own good, the more thou seest, that, by it, not only are
evils shunned, but some goods too surpassed. For adultery and
fornication are evils. But from these unlawful things she is very
far removed, who hath bound herself by liberty of vow, and, not by
command of law, but by counsel of charity, hath brought to pass
that even things lawful should not be lawful to her. And marriage
chastity is a good, but widowed continence is a better good.

things which in figure happened among them, whether in the case of
those who knew, or in the case of those who knew not those things,
was nothing else than a Prophet of Christ, of whom should be born
the Flesh also of Christ. In order therefore for the propagation of
that people, he was accounted accursed by sentence of the Law,

bearing; so that we most rightly believe of them that they would
not have sought sensual intercourse, in case a family could have
come by any other means. And to the husbands was allowed the use of
several wives living; and that the cause of this was not lust of
the flesh, but forethought of begetting, is shown by the fact,
that, as it was lawful for holy men to have several wives living,
it was not likewise lawful for holy women to have intercourse with
several husbands living; in that they would be by so much the
baser, by how much the more they sought what would not add to their
fruitfulness. Wherefore holy Ruth, not having seed such as at that
time was necessary in Israel, on the death of her husband sought
another of whom to have it. Therefore than this one twice married,
Anna once married a widow was on this account more blessed, in that
she attained also to be a prophetess of Christ; concerning whom we
are to believe, that, although she had no sons, (which indeed
Scripture by keeping silence hath left uncertain,) yet, had she by
that Spirit foreseen that Christ would immediately come of a
virgin, by Which she was enabled to recognize Him even as a child:
whence, with good reason, even without sons, (that is, assuming she
had none,) she refused a second marriage: in that she knew that now
was the time wherein Christ were better served, not by duty of
bearing, but by zeal of containing: not by fruitfulness of married
womb, but by chastity <pb n="445" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_445.html" id="v.iv.xi-Page_445"/>of widowed conduct. But if Ruth
also was aware that by her flesh was propagated a seed, whereof
Christ should hereafter have flesh, and by marrying set forth her
ministering to this knowledge, I dare not any longer say that the
widowhood of Anna was more blessed than her
fruitfulness.</p>

commends with apostolic sobriety and authority the good of
marriage, but doth not impose the duty of bearing, as though in
order to obey the law, even on those who &#8220;receive&#8221; the good of
continence. Lastly, why he had said this, he unfolds, when he adds
and says, &#8220;To give no occasion of speaking evil to the adversary;
for already certain have turned back after Satan:&#8221; that by these
words of his we may understand, that those, whom he would have
marry, could have done better to contain than marry; but better to
marry than to go back after Satan, that is, to fall away from that
excellent purpose of virginal or widowed chastity, by looking back
to things that are behind, and perish. Wherefore, such as contain
not themselves, let them marry before they make profession of
continence, before they vow unto God, what, if they pay not, they
are justly condemned. Forsooth in another place he saith of such,
&#8220;For when they have lived in delights in Christ, they wish to
marry: having condemnation, in that they have made of none effect
their first faith;&#8221;<note place="end" n="2248" id="v.iv.xii-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv.xii-p6"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 11, 12" id="v.iv.xii-p6.2" parsed="|1Tim|5|11|5|12" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.11-1Tim.5.12">1 Tim. v. 11, 12</scripRef>. [See

their will from the purpose of continence unto marriage. Forsooth

Therefore the good of marriage is indeed ever a good: but in the
people of God it was at one time an act of obedience unto the law;
now it is a remedy for weakness, but in certain a solace of human
nature. Forsooth to be engaged in the getting of children, not
after the fashion of dogs by promiscuous use of females, but by
honest order of marriage, is not an affection such as we are to
blame in a man; yet this affection itself the Christian mind,
having thoughts of heavenly things, in a more praiseworthy manner
surpasses and overcomes.</p>

such are judged matter of condemnation; but there is condemned a

higher good: <pb n="446" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_446.html" id="v.iv.xiii-Page_446"/>lastly, such are condemned, not
because they have entered upon marriage faith afterwards, but
because they have made of none effect the first faith of
continence. And in order to suggest this in few words, the Apostle
would not say, that they have condemnation, who after purpose of
greater sanctity marry, (not because they are not condemned, but
lest in them marriage itself should be thought to be condemned:)
but, after he had said, &#8220;they wish to marry,&#8221; he straightway
added, &#8220;having condemnation.&#8221; And he stated the reason, &#8220;in
that they have made of none effect their former faith,&#8221; in order
that it may appear that it is the will which fell away from its
purpose, which is condemned, whether marriage follow, or fail to
follow.</p>

13. Wherefore they who say
that the marriages of such are not marriages, but rather
adulteries, seem not to me to consider with sufficient acuteness
and care what they say; forsooth they, are misled by a semblance of
truth. For, whereas they, who of Christian sanctity marry not, are
said to choose the marriage of Christ, hence certain argue saying,
If she, who during the life of her husband is married to another,
be an adulteress, even as the Lord Himself hath laid down in the
Gospel; therefore, during the life of Christ, over Whom death hath
no more dominion,<note place="end" n="2252" id="v.iv.xiv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv.xiv-p2"> <scripRef passage="Rom. vi. 9" id="v.iv.xiv-p2.2" parsed="|Rom|6|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.6.9">Rom. vi. 9</scripRef></p></note> if she who had chosen His
marriage, be married to a man, she is an adulteress. They, who say
this, are moved indeed with acuteness, but fail to observe, how
great absurdity in fact follows on this reasoning. For whereas it
is praiseworthy that, even during the life of her husband, by his
consent, a female vow continence unto Christ, now, according to the
reasoning of these persons, no one ought to do this, lest she make
Christ Himself, what is impious to imagine, an adulterer, by being
married to Him during the life of her husband. Next, whereas first
marriages are of better desert than second, far be it that this be
the thought of holy widows, that Christ seem unto them as a second
husband. For Himself they used heretofore also to have, (when they
were subject and did faithful service to their own husbands,) not
after the flesh, but after the Spirit a Husband; unto Whom the
Church herself, of which they are members, is the wife; who by
soundness of faith, of hope, of charity, not in the virgins alone,
but in widows also, and faithful married women, is altogether a
virgin. Forsooth unto the universal Church, of which they all are
members, the Apostle saith, &#8220;I joined you unto one husband a
chaste virgin to present unto Christ.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2253" id="v.iv.xiv-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv.xiv-p3"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 2" id="v.iv.xiv-p3.2" parsed="|2Cor|11|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.2">2 Cor. xi. 2</scripRef>. [See

ill-considered notion, (whereby they think that the marriages of
women who have fallen away from this holy purpose, in case they
shall have married, are no marriages,) no small evil, that wives be
separated from their husbands, as though they were adulteresses,
not wives; and wishing to restore to continence the women thus
separated, they make their husbands real adulterers, in that during
the life of their wives they have married others.</p>

14. Wherefore I cannot indeed
say, of females who have fallen away from a better purpose, in case
they shall have married, that they are adulteries, not marriages;
but I plainly would not hesitate to say, that departures and
fallings away from a holier chastity, which is vowed unto the Lord,
are worse than adulteries. For if, what may no way be doubted, it
pertains unto an offense against Christ, when a member of Him
keepeth not faith to her husband; how much graver offense is it
against Him, when unto Himself faith is not kept, in a matter which
He requires when offered, Who had not required that it should be
offered. For when each fails to render that which, not by force of
command, but by advice of counsel, he vowed, by so much the more
doth he increase the unrighteousness of the wrong done to his vow,
by how much the less necessity he had to vow. These matters I for
this reason treat of, that you may not think either that second
marriages are criminal, or that any marriages whatsoever, being
marriages, are an evil. Therefore let this be your mind, not that
you condemn them, but that you despise them. Therefore the good of
widowed chastity is becoming after a brighter fashion, in that in
order to make vow and profession of it, females may despise what is
both pleasing and lawful. But after profession of vow made they
must continue to rein in, and overcome, what is pleasing, because
it is no longer lawful.</p>

15. Men are wont to move a
question concerning a third or fourth marriage, and even more
numerous marriages than this. On which to make answer strictly, I
dare neither to condemn any marriage, nor to take from these the
shame of their great number. But, lest the brevity of this my

if she shall have so continued.&#8221; I know not what can be added to,
or taken from, this sentence, so far as relates to this matter.
Next I hear Himself also, the Master and Lord of the Apostles and
of us, answering the Sadducees, when they had proposed to Him a
woman not once-married, or twice-married, but, if it can be said,
seven-married,<note place="end" n="2257" id="v.iv.xvi-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv.xvi-p5"> <i>Septiviram</i></p></note> whose wife

He made mention of their resurrection, who shall rise again unto

have said, Ye do err, knowing not the Scriptures, nor the power of

those that were wives of many; and then added, that neither doth
any there marry. But neither, as we see, did He in this sentence
show any sign of condemning her who was the wife of so many
husbands. Wherefore neither dare I, contrary to the feeling of
natural shame, say, that, when her husbands are dead, a woman marry
as often as she will; nor dare I, out of my own heart, beside the
authority of holy Scripture, condemn any number of marriages
whatever. But, what I say to a widow, who hath had one husband,
this I say to every widow; you will be more blessed, if you shall
have so continued.</p>

16. For that also is no
foolish question which is wont to be proposed, that whoso can may
say, which widow is to be preferred in desert; whether one who hath
had one husband, who, after having lived a considerable time with
her husband, being left a widow with sons born to her and alive,
hath made profession of continence; or she who as a young woman
having lost two husbands within two years, having no children left
alive to console her, hath vowed to God continence, and in it hath
grown old with most enduring sanctity. Herein let them exercise
themselves, if they can, by discussing, and by showing some proof
to us, who weigh the merits of widows by number of husbands, not by
the strength itself of continence. For, if they shall have said,
that she who hath had one husband is to be preferred to her who
hath had two; unless they shall have alleged some special reason or
authority, they will assuredly be found to set before excellence of
soul, not greater excellence of soul, but good fortune of the
flesh. Forsooth it pertained unto good fortune of the flesh, both
to live a long time with her husband, and to conceive sons. But, if
they prefer her not on this account, that she had sons; at any rate
the very fact that she lived a long time with her husband, what
else was it than good fortune of the flesh? Further, the desert of
Anna herself is herein chiefly commended, in that, after she had so
soon buried her husband, through her protracted life she long
contended with the flesh, and overcame. For so it is written,
&#8220;And there was Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of
the tribe of Aser; she was far advanced in many days; and had lived
with her husband seven years from her virginity; and she was a
widow even unto eighty-four years, who used not to depart from the
Temple, by fastings and prayers serving day and night.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2260" id="v.iv.xvii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv.xvii-p2"> <scripRef passage="Luke ii. 36, 37" id="v.iv.xvii-p2.2" parsed="|Luke|2|36|2|37" osisRef="Bible:Luke.2.36-Luke.2.37">Luke ii. 36, 37</scripRef></p></note> You see
how the holy widow is not only commended in this, that she had had
one husband, but also, that she had lived few years with a husband
from her virginity, and had with so great service of piety
continued her office of widowed chastity even unto so great
age.</p>

17. Let us therefore set
before our eyes three widows, each having one of the things, the
whole of which were in her: let us suppose one who had had one
husband, in whose case is wanting both so great length of
widowhood, in that she hath lived long with her husband, and so
great zeal of piety, in that she doth not so serve with fasts and
prayers: a second, who after the very short life of her former
husband, had quickly lost a second also, and is now long time a
widow, but yet herself also doth not so set herself to the most
religious service of fasts and prayers: a third, who not only hath
had two husbands, but also hath lived long with each of them
singly, or with one of them, and being left a <pb n="448" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_448.html" id="v.iv.xviii-Page_448"/>widow at a
later period of life, wherein indeed, in case she had wished to
marry, she might also conceive sons, hath taken upon her widowed
continence; but is more intent on God, more careful to do always
the things that please Him, day and night, like Anna, serving by
prayers and fasts. If a question be raised, which of these is to be
preferred in deserts, who but must see that in this contest the
palm must be given to the greater and, more glowing piety? So also
if three others be set, in each of whom are two of those three, but
one of the three in each wanting, who can doubt that they will be
the better, who shall have in a more excellent manner in their two
goods pious humility, in order that there may be lofty
piety?</p>

six widows could come up to your standard. For you, in case that
you shall have maintained this vow even unto old age, mayest have
all the three things wherein the desert of Anna excelled. For both
thou hast had one husband, and he lived not long with thee in the
flesh; and, by this means, in case that thou shall show forth
obedience to the words of the Apostle, saying, &#8220;But she who is a

shun what follows, &#8220;But she who passes her time in delights,

shall be thine also. But you have sons also, which haply she had
not. And yet you are not on this account to be praised, that you
have them, but that you are zealous to nurture and educate them
piously. For that they were born to thee, was of fruitfulness; that
they are alive, is of good fortune; that they be so brought up, is

it ye have offered unto Christ, hath added something of virginal
desert also unto the widowed deserts of her grandmother and mother.

19. These discussions,
therefore, concerning the different deserts of married women, and
of different widows, I would not in this work enter upon, if, what
I am writing unto you, I were writing only for you. But, since
there are in this kind of discourse certain very difficult
questions, it was my wish to say something more than what properly
relates to you, by reason of certain, who seem not to themselves
learned, unless they essay, not by passing judgment to discuss, but
by rending to cut in pieces the labors of others: in the next
place, that you yourself also may not only keep what you have
vowed, and make advance in that good; but also know more carefully
and more surely, that this same good of yours is not distinguished
from the evil of marriage, but is set before the good of marriage.
For let not such, as condemn the marriage of widowed females,
although they exercise their continence in abstaining from many
things, which you make use of, on this account lead you astray, to
think what they think, although you cannot do what they do. For no
one would be a madman, although he see that the strength of a
madman is greater than of men in their sound senses. Chiefly,
therefore, let sound doctrine both adorn and guard goodness of
purpose. Forsooth it is from this cause that catholic females, even
after that they have been married more than once, are by just
judgment preferred, not only to the widows who have had one
husband, but also to the virgins of heretics. There are indeed on
these three matters, of marriage, widowhood, and virginity, many
winding recesses of questions, many perplexities; and in order by
discussion to enter deeply into and solve these, there is required
both greater care, and a fuller discourse; that either we may have
a right mind in all those things, or, if in any matter we be
otherwise minded, this also God may reveal unto us. However, what
there also the Apostle saith next after, &#8220;Whereunto we have
arrived, in that let us walk.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2264" id="v.iv.xx-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv.xx-p2"> <scripRef passage="Phil. iii. 15, 16" id="v.iv.xx-p2.2" parsed="|Phil|3|15|3|16" osisRef="Bible:Phil.3.15-Phil.3.16">Phil. iii. 15, 16</scripRef></p></note> But we have arrived, in what
relates to this matter on which we are speaking, so far as to set
continence before marriage, but holy virginity even before widowed
continence; and not to condemn any marriages, which yet are not
adulteries but marriages, by praise of any purpose whatever of our
own or of our friends. Many other things on these matters we have
said in a Book concerning the Good of Marriage, and in another Book
concerning Holy Virginity, and in a Book which we composed with as
great pains as we could against Faustus the Manichee; since, by
most biting reproaches in his writ<pb n="449" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_449.html" id="v.iv.xx-Page_449"/>ings of the chaste marriages of
Patriarchs and Prophets, he had turned aside the minds of certain
unlearned persons from soundness of faith.</p>

20. Wherefore, forasmuch as
in the beginning of this little work I had proposed certain two
necessary matters, and had undertaken to follow them out; one which
related to doctrine, the other to exhortation; and I have not
failed in the former part, to the best of my power, according to
the business which I had undertaken; let us come to exhortation, in
order that the good which is known wisely, may be pursued ardently.
And in this matter I give you this advice first, that, how great
soever love of pious continence you feel to be in you, you ascribe
it to the favor of God, and give Him thanks, Who of His Holy Spirit
hath freely given unto you so much, as that, His love being shed
abroad in your heart, the love of a better good should take away
from you the permission of a lawful matter. For it was His gift to
you that you should not wish to marry, when it was lawful, in order
that now it should not be lawful, even if you wished; and that by
this means the wish not to do it might be the more settled, lest
what were now unlawful be done, which was not done even when
lawful; and that, a widow of Christ, you should so far attain as to
see your daughter also a virgin of Christ; for whilst you are
praying as Anna, she hath become what Mary was. These by how much
the more you know them to be gifts of God, by so much the more are
you by the same gifts blessed; yea, rather, you are not so
otherwise than as you know from Whom you have what you have. For
listen to what the Apostle said on this matter, &#8220;But we have
received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit Which is of
God, that we may know what things have been given to us by
God.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2265" id="v.iv.xxi-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv.xxi-p2"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 12" id="v.iv.xxi-p2.2" parsed="|1Cor|2|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.12">1 Cor. ii. 12</scripRef></p></note> Forsooth
many have many gifts of God, and by not knowing from Whom they have
them, come to boast themselves with impious vanity. But there is no
one blessed with the gifts of God, who is ungrateful to the Giver.
Forasmuch as, also, whereas in the course of the sacred Mysteries
we are bidden to &#8220;lift up our hearts,&#8221; it is by His help that
we are able, by Whose bidding we are admonished; and therefore it
follows, that, of this so great good of the heart lifted up, we
give not the glory to ourselves as of our own strength, but render
thanks unto our Lord God. For of this we are straightway
admonished, that &#8220;this is meet,&#8221; &#8220;this is right.&#8221; You
remember whence these words are taken, you recognize by what

how great holiness they are commended within. Therefore hold and
have what you have received, and return thanks to the Giver. For,
although it be yours to receive and have, yet you have that, which
you have received; forasmuch as to one waxing proud, and impiously
glorying of that which he had, as though he had it of himself, the

steal through the ears unto the minds of many, being (as must be
said with tears) hostile to the grace of Christ, which go to
persuade that we count not as necessary for us prayer unto the
Lord, that we enter not into temptation. For they so essay to
defend the free will of man, as that by it alone, even without help
of the grace of God, we are able to fulfill what is commanded us of
God. And thus it follows, that the Lord in vain said, &#8220;Watch and

oppose him, and say, Why seek I of the Lord, what He hath set in my
own power? But far be it, that he be so minded, who is sound
minded. Wherefore let us seek that He may give, what He bids us
that we have. For to this end He bids us have this, which as yet we
have not, to admonish as what to seek; and that when we shall have
found the power to do what He hath bidden, we may understand, of
this also, whence we have received it; lest, being puffed and
lifted up by the spirit of this world, we know not what things have
been given unto us of God. Wherefore the free choice of the human
will we by no means destroy, when the Grace of God, by which the
free choice itself is helped, we deny not with ungrateful pride,
but rather set forth with grateful piety. For it is ours to will:
but the will itself is both admonished

and filled, that it may have. For were not we to will, certainly
neither should we receive the things that are given, nor should we
have. For who would have continence, (among the rest of the gifts
of God to speak of this rather, of which I am speaking to you,)
who, I say, would have continence, unless willing? forasmuch as
also no one would receive unless willing. But if you ask, Whose
gift it is, that it can be by our will received and had? listen to
Scripture; yea, rather, because thou knowest, recollect what thou
hast read, &#8220;Whereas I knew,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;that no one can be

that He give what He bids, by helping and inspiring, Who hath
admonished us what to will by commanding and calling. Whatsoever of
this He hath given, let us pray that He preserve; but what He hath
not given as yet, let us pray that He supply; yet let us pray and
give thanks for what we have received; and for what we have not yet
received, from the very fact that we are not ungrateful for what we
have received, let us trust that we shall receive it. For He, Who
hath given power unto the faithful who are married to contain from
adulteries and fornications, Himself hath given unto holy virgins
and widows to contain from all sexual intercourse; in the case of

is it haply that from Him indeed we have received continence, but
from ourselves have wisdom? What then is it that the Apostle James

22. Now it has been my wish
on this account to say something on this subject, by reason of
certain of our brethren most friendly and dear to us, and without
willful guilt indeed entangled in this error, but yet entangled;
who think, that, when they exhort any to righteousness and piety,
their exhortation will not have force, unless the whole of that,
wherein they would work upon man that man should work, they set in
the power of man, not helped by the grace of God, but put forth by
the alone choice of the free will; as though there can be free will
to perform a good work, unless set free by the gift of God! And
they mark not that this very thing themselves also have by the gift
of God, that with such power they exhort, as to excite the dull
wills of men to enter upon a good life, to enkindle the cold, to
correct such as are in error, to convert such as are turned aside,
to pacify such as are opposed. For thus they are able to succeed in
persuading what they would persuade to, or if they work not these
things in the wills of men, what is their work? wherefore speak
they? Let them leave them rather to their own choice. But if in
them they work these things, what? I pray, doth man, in the will of
man, work so great things by speaking, and doth God work nothing
there by helping? Yea rather, with how great soever power of
discourse man may prevail, as that by skill of discussion, and
sweetness of speech, he in the will of man implant truth, nourish
charity, by teaching remove error, by exhortation remove sloth,
&#8220;Neither he who planteth is any thing, nor he who watereth, but

not as yet vowed unto God widowed continence, we would assuredly
exhort you to vow it; but, in that you have already vowed it, we
exhort you to persevere. And yet I see that I must so speak as to
lead those also who had as yet thought of marriage to love it and

Whatever, therefore, I of earnest purpose of mind would be expended
also on these things whereby she would have to please a husband,
the unmarried Christian woman ought in a certain way to gather and
bring together unto that earnest purpose whereby she is to please

she pleases Him; but by how much the more her thoughts are of the

whom ye had to please, by this time, perhaps, you would feel
ashamed to adorn yourself together with your daughter; now let it
not shame you, to set yourselves to do what may adorn you both
together; because it is not matter of blame, but of glory, that ye
be loved both together by That One. But white and red, feigned and
laid on with paints, ye would not use, even if ye had husbands; not
thinking that they were fit persons for you to deceive, or
yourselves such as ought to deceive; now therefore That King, Who
had longed for the beauty of His Only Spouse, of Whom ye are
members, do ye with all truth together please, together cleave
unto; she with virginal chastity, you with widowed continence, both
with spiritual beauty. In which beauty also her grandmother, and
your mother-in-law, who by this time surely hath grown old, is
beautiful together with you. Forsooth whilst charity carries the
vigor of this beauty into things that are before, length of years
causeth not in it a wrinkle. You have with you a holy aged woman,
both in your house and in Christ, whom to consult concerning
perseverance; how you are to fight with this or that temptation,
what you are to do, that it may be the more easily overcome; what
safeguard you are to take, that it may not easily again lay wait;
and if there be any thing of this sort, she teaches you, who is now
by time fixed, by love a well-wisher, by natural affection full of
cares, by age secure. Do you specially, do you in such things
consult her, who hath made trial of what you have made trial of.

for herself, but she is more full of care for her granddaughter,

temptations; but you she sees nearer to her own age, and mother of
a daughter of such an age, as that, had you seen her married,
(which now is not lawful, and far be it from her,) I think you
would have blushed to bear children together with her. How much
then is it that now remains to you of a dangerous age, who are on
this account not called a grandmother, in order that together with
your daughter you may be fruitful in offspring of holy thoughts and
works? Therefore not without reason is the grandmother more full of
care for her, for whom you also the mother; because both what she

world is now perishing, the married woman, for whom beareth she? Or
in heart about to bear, and in flesh not about to bear, why doth
she marry? But if the world is still about to last, why is not He
more loved, by Whom the world was made? If already enticements of
this life are failing, there is not any thing for a Christian soul
with desire to seek after; but if they shall yet remain, there is
what with holiness he may despise. For the one of these two there
is no hope of lust, in the other greater glory of charity. How many
or how long are the very years, in which the flower of carnal age
seems to flourish? Some females having thoughts of marriage, and
with ardor wishing it, whilst they are being despised or put off,
on a sudden have grown old, so as that now they would feel shame,
rather than desire, to marry. But many having married, their
husbands having set out into distant countries very soon after
their union, have grown aged expecting their return, and, as though
soon left widows, at times have not even attained so as at least as
old women to receive their old men on their return. If therefore,
when betrothed bridegrooms despised or delayed, or when husbands
were abroad, carnal desire could be restrained from commission of
fornication or adultery, why cannot it be restrained from
commission of sacrilege? If it hath been repressed, when being
deferred it was glowing, why is it not put down, when having been
cut off it had grown cold? For they in greater measure endure
glowing of desire, who despair not of the pleasure of the same
desire. But whoso of unmarried persons vow chastity to God,
withdraw that very hope, which is the fuel of love. Hence with more
ease is desire bridled, which is kindled by no expectation; and
yet, unless against this prayer be made, in order to overcome it,
itself as unlawful is the more ardently wished for.</p>

it from you, that ye be taken with lust of riches instead of lust
of marriage, or that in your hearts money succeed to the place of
love of a husband. For looking into men&#8217;s conversation, we have
often found by experience, that in certain persons, when wantonness
hath been restrained, avarice hath increased. For, as, in the
senses themselves of the body, they who see not hear more keenly,
and discern many things by touch, nor have such as have the use of
their eyes so great life in their touch; and in this instance it is
understood that, when the exertion of the power of attention<note place="end" n="2290" id="v.iv.xxvii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv.xxvii-p4"> <i>Intentione</i></p></note> hath been
restrained in one approach, that is, of the eyes, it puts itself
forth into other senses, more ready with keenness to distinguish,
as though it essayed to supply from the one what was denied in the
other; thus also often carnal lust, being restrained from pleasure
of sensual intercourse, with greater strength reaches itself forth
to desire money, and when turned away from the one, turns itself
with more glow of passion to the other. But in you let the love of
riches grow cold together with the love of marriage, and let a
pious use of what property you possess be directed to spiritual
delights, that your liberality wax warm rather in helping such as
are in want than in enriching covetous persons. Forsooth into the
heavenly treasury are sent not gifts to the covetous, but alms to
the needy, which above measure help the prayers of widows.
Fastings, also, and watchings, so far as they disturb not health,
if they be spent in praying, singing psalms, reading, and
meditating in the Law of God, even the very things which seem
laborious are turned into spiritual delights. For no way burdensome
are the labors of such as love, but even of themselves delight, as
of such as hunt, fowl, fish, gather grapes, traffic, delight
themselves with some game. It matters therefore what <pb n="453" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_453.html" id="v.iv.xxvii-Page_453"/>be loved.
For, in the case of what is loved, either there is no labor, or the
labor also is loved. And consider how it should be matter for shame

27. Indeed in all spiritual
delights, which unmarried women enjoy, their holy conversation
ought also to be with caution; lest haply, though their life be not
evil through haughtiness, their report be evil through negligence.
Nor are they to be listened to, whether they be holy men or women,
when (upon occasion of their neglect in some matter being blamed,
through which it comes to pass that they fall into evil suspicion,
from which they know that their life is far removed) they say that
it is enough for them their conscience before God, despising what
men think of them, not only imprudently<note place="end" n="2292" id="v.iv.xxviii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.iv.xxviii-p2"> al. &#8220;<i>impudenter,</i>&#8221;

the souls of others; whether of such as blaspheme the way of God,
who following their suspicion are displeased at what is the chaste
life of the Saints, as though it were shameful, or of such also as
make excuse, and imitate, not what they see, but what they think.
Wherefore whosoever guards his life from charges of shameful and
evil deeds, does good to himself; but whosoever guards his
character too, is merciful also towards others. For unto ourselves

neither now, if all shall have been continent, will they give the

wish to marry a wife. Therefore without anxiety urge on whom ye

<p class="c49" id="v.v.i-p3">&#8220;I have also written a Book on
Lying, which though it takes some pains to understand, contains
much that is useful for the exercise of the mind, and more that is
profitable to morals, in inculcating the love of speaking the
truth. This also I was minded to remove from my works, because it
seemed to me obscure, and intricate, and altogether troublesome;
for which reason I had not sent it abroad. And when I had
afterwards written another book, under this title, <i>Against
Lying</i>, much more had I determined and ordered that the former
should cease to exist; which however was not done. Therefore in
this retractation of my works, as I have found this still in being,
I have ordered that it should remain; chiefly because therein are
to be found some necessary things which in the other are not. Why
the other has for its title, <i>Against Lying</i>, but this, <i>Of
Lying</i>, the reason is this, that throughout the one is an open
assault upon lying, whereas great part of this is taken up with the
discussion of the question for and against. Both, however, are
directed to the same object. This book begins thus: &#8220;<i>Magna

1. <span class="c19" id="v.v.ii-p1.1">
There</span> is a great question about Lying, which often arises in
the midst of our every day business, and gives us much trouble,
that we may not either rashly call that a lie which is not such, or
decide that it is sometimes right to tell a lie, that is, a kind of
honest, well-meant, charitable lie. This question we will painfully
discuss by seeking with them that seek: whether to any good
purpose, we need not take upon ourselves to affirm, for the
attentive reader will sufficiently gather from the course of the
discussion. It is, indeed, very full of dark corners, and hath many
cavern-like windings, whereby it oft eludes the eagerness of the
seeker; so that at one moment what was found seems to slip out of
one&#8217;s hands, and anon comes to light again, and then is once more
lost to sight. At last, however, the chase will bear down more
surely, and will overtake our sentence. Wherein if there is any
error, yet as Truth is that which setteth free from all error,
and <pb n="458" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_458.html" id="v.v.ii-Page_458"/>Falsehood that which entangleth in all error, one never
errs more safely, methinks, than when one errs by too much loving
the truth, and too much rejecting of falsehood. For they who find
great fault say it is too much, whereas peradventure Truth would
say after all, it is not yet enough. But whoso readest, thou wilt
do well to find no fault until thou have read the whole; so wilt
thou have less fault to find. Eloquence thou must not look for: we
have been intent upon things, and upon dispatch in putting out of
hand a matter which nearly concerns our every day life, and
therefore have had small pains, or almost none, to bestow upon
words.</p>

2. Setting aside, therefore,
jokes, which have never been accounted lies, seeing they bear with
them in the tone of voice, and in the very mood of the joker a most
evident indication that he means no deceit, although the thing he
utters be not true: touching which kind of discourse, whether it be
meet to be used by perfect minds, is another question which we have
not at this time taken in hand to clear; but setting jokes apart,
the first point to be attended to, is, that a person should not be
thought to lie, who lieth not.</p>
</div3>

<div3 type="Section" n="3" title="Section 3" shorttitle="Section 3" progress="79.64%" prev="v.v.iii" next="v.v.v" id="v.v.iv"><p class="c10" id="v.v.iv-p1">

3. For which purpose we must
see what a lie is. For not every one who says a false thing lies,
if he believes or opines that to be true which he says. Now between
believing and opining there is this difference, that sometimes he
who believes feels that he does not know that which he believes,
(although he may know himself to be ignorant of a thing, and yet
have no doubt at all concerning it, if he most firmly believes it:)
whereas he who opines, thinks he knows that which he does not know.
Now whoever utters that which he holds in his mind either as belief
or as opinion, even though it be false, he lies not. For this he
owes to the faith of his utterance, that he thereby produce that
which he holds in his mind, and has in that way in which he
produces it. Not that he is without fault, although he lie not, if
either he believes what he ought not to believe, or thinks he knows
what he knows not, even though it should be true: for he accounts
an unknown thing for a known. Wherefore, that man lies, who has one
thing in his mind and utters another in words, or by signs of
whatever kind. Whence also the heart of him who lies is said to be
double; that is, there is a double thought: the one, of that thing
which he either knows or thinks to be true and does not produce;
the other, of that thing which he produces instead thereof, knowing
or thinking it to be false. Whence it comes to pass, that he may
say a false thing and yet not lie, if he thinks it to be so as he
says although it be not so; and, that he may say a true thing, and
yet lie, if he thinks it to be false and utters it for true,
although in reality it be so as he utters it. For from the sense of
his own mind, not from the verity or falsity of the things
themselves, is he to be judged to lie or not to lie. Therefore he
who utters a false thing for a true, which however he opines to be
true, may be called erring and rash: but he is not rightly said to
lie; because he has not a double heart when he utters it, neither
does he wish to deceive, but is deceived. But the fault of him who
lies, is, the desire of deceiving in the uttering of his mind;
whether he do deceive, in that he is believed when uttering the
false thing; or whether he do not deceive, either in that he is not
believed, or in that he utters a true thing with will to deceive,
which he does not think to be true: wherein being believed, he does
not deceive though it was his will to deceive: except that he
deceives in so far as he is thought to know or think as he
utters.</p>
</div3>

<div3 type="Section" n="4" title="Section 4" shorttitle="Section 4" progress="79.74%" prev="v.v.iv" next="v.v.vi" id="v.v.v"><p class="c10" id="v.v.v-p1">

4. But it may be a very nice
question whether in the absence of all will to deceive, lying is
altogether absent. Thus, put the case that a person shall speak a
false thing, which he esteems to be false, on the ground that he
thinks he is not believed, to the intent, that in that way
falsifying his faith he may deter the person to whom he speaks,
which person he perceives does not choose to believe him. For here
is a person who tells a lie with studied purpose of not deceiving,
if to tell a lie is to utter any thing otherwise than you know or
think it to be. But if it be no lie, unless when something is
uttered with wish to deceive, that person lies not, who says a
false thing, knowing or thinking it to be false, but says it on
purpose that the person to whom he speaks by not believing him may
not be deceived, because the speaker either knows or thinks the
other will not believe him. Whence if it appear to be possible that
a person should say a false thing on purpose that he to whom it is
said may not be deceived, on the other hand there is this opposite
case, the case of a person saying the truth on purpose that he may
deceive. For if a man determines to say a true thing because he
perceives he is not believed, that man speaks truth on purpose that
he may deceive: for he knows or thinks that what is said may be
accounted false, just because it is spoken by him. Wherefore in
saying a true thing on purpose that it may be thought false, he
says a true thing on purpose to deceive. So that it may be
inquired, which rather lies: he who says a false thing that
he <pb n="459" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_459.html" id="v.v.v-Page_459"/>may not deceive, or he who says a true thing that he may
deceive? the one knowing or thinking that he says a false thing,
and the other knowing or thinking that he says a true thing? For we
have already said that the person who does not know the thing to be
false which he utters, does not lie if he thinks it to be true; and
that that person rather lies who utters even a true thing when he
thinks it false: because it is by the sense of their mind that they
are to be judged. Concerning these persons therefore, whom we have
set forth, there is no small question. The one, who knows or thinks
he says a false thing, and says it on purpose that he may not
deceive: as, if he knows a certain road to be beset by robbers, and
fearing lest some person for whose safety he is anxious should go
by that road, which person he knows does not trust him, should tell
him that that road has no robbers, on purpose that he may not go by
it, as he will think there are robbers there precisely because the
other has told him there are none, and he is resolved not to
believe him, accounting him a liar. The other, who knowing or
thinking that to be true which he says, says it on purpose that he
may deceive: for instance, if he tells a person who does not
believe him, that there are robbers in that road where he really
knows them to be, that he to whom he tells it may the rather go by
that road and so fall among robbers, because he thinks that to be
false, which the other told him. Which then of these lies? the one
who has chosen to say a false thing that he may not deceive? or the
other who has chosen to say a true thing that he may deceive? that
one, who in saying a false thing aimed that he to whom he spake
should follow the truth? or this one, who in saying a true thing
aimed that he to whom he spake should follow a falsehood? Or haply
have both lied? the one, because he wished to say a false thing:
the other, because he wished to deceive? Or rather, has neither
lied? not the one, because he had the will not to deceive: not the
other, because he had the will to speak the truth? For the question
is not now which of them sinned, but which of them lied: as indeed
it is presently seen that the latter sinned, because by speaking a
truth he brought it about that a person should fall among robbers,
and that the former has not sinned, or even has done good, because
by speaking a false thing he has been the means of a person&#8217;s
avoiding destruction. But then these instances may be turned the
other way, so that the one should be supposed to wish some more
grievous suffering to the person whom he wishes not to be deceived;
for there are many cases of persons who through knowing certain
things to be true, have brought destruction upon themselves, if the
things were such as ought to have continued unknown to them: and
the other may be supposed to wish some convenience to result to the
person whom he wishes to be deceived; for there have been instances
of persons who would have destroyed themselves had they known some
evil that had really befallen those who were dear to them, and
through deeming it false have spared themselves: and so to be
deceived has been a benefit to them, as to others it has been a
hurt to know the truth. The question therefore is not with what
purpose of doing a kindness or a hurt, either the one said a false
thing that he might not deceive, or the other a true thing that he
might deceive: but, setting apart the convenience or inconvenience
of the persons spoken to, in so far as relates to the very truth
and falsehood, the question is, whether both of them or neither has
lied. For if a lie is an utterance with will of uttering a false
thing, that man has rather lied who willed to say a false thing,
and said what he willed, albeit he said it of set purpose not to
deceive. But if a lie is any utterance whatever with will to
deceive; then not the former has lied, but the latter, who even in
speaking truth willed to deceive. And if a lie is an utterance with
will of any falsity, both have lied; because both the former willed
his utterance to be false, and the latter willed a false thing to
be believed concerning his utterance which was true. Further, if a
lie is an utterance of a person wishing to utter a false thing that
he may deceive, neither has lied; because both the former in saying
a false thing had the will to make a true thing believed, and the
latter to say a true thing in order that he might make a false
thing believed. We shall be clear then of all rashness and all
lying, if, what we know to be true or right to be believed, we
utter when need is, and wish to make that thing believed which we
utter. If, however, either thinking that to be true which is false,
or accounting as known that which is to us unknown, or believing
what we ought not to believe, or uttering it when need is not, we
yet have no other aim than to make that believed which we utter; we
do not stand clear indeed of the error of temerity, but we do stand
clear of all lying. For there is no need to be afraid of any of
those definitions, when the mind has a good conscience, that it
utters that which to be true it either knows, or opines, or
believes, and that it has no wish <pb n="460" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_460.html" id="v.v.v-Page_460"/>to make any thing believed but
that which it utters.</p>

5. But whether a lie be at
some times useful, is a much greater and more concerning question.
Whether, as above, it be a lie, when a person has no will to
deceive, or even makes it his business that the person to whom he
says a thing shall not be deceived although he did wish the thing
itself which he uttered to be false, but this on purpose that he
might cause a truth to be believed; whether, again, it be a lie
when a person willingly utters even a truth for the purpose of
deceiving; this may be doubted. But none doubts that it is a lie
when a person willingly utters a falsehood for the purpose of
deceiving: wherefore a false utterance put forth with will to
deceive is manifestly a lie. But whether this alone be a lie, is
another question. Meanwhile, taking this kind of lie, in which all
agree, let us inquire, whether it be sometimes useful to utter a
falsehood with will to deceive. They who think it is, advance
testimonies to their opinion, by alleging the case of Sarah,<note place="end" n="2303" id="v.v.vi-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.vi-p2"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xviii. 15" id="v.v.vi-p2.2" parsed="|Gen|18|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.18.15">Gen. xviii. 15</scripRef></p></note> who, when

pick out, of lies told by persons whom you would not dare to blame,
and so must own that it may sometimes be not only not blameworthy,
but even praiseworthy to tell a lie. They add also a case with
which to urge not only those who are devoted to the Divine Books,
but all men and common sense, saying, Suppose a man should take
refuge with thee, who by thy lie might be saved from death,
wouldest thou not tell it? If a sick man should ask a question
which it is not expedient that he should know, and might be more
grievously afflicted even by thy returning him no answer, wilt thou
venture either to tell the truth to the destruction of the man&#8217;s
life, or rather to hold thy peace, than by a virtuous and merciful
lie to be serviceable to his weak health? By these and such like
arguments they think they most plentifully prove, that if occasion
of doing good require, we may sometimes tell a lie.</p>

7. Neither do they confess
that they are awed by those citations from the Old Testament which
are alleged as examples of lies: for there, every incident may
possibly be taken figuratively, although it really did take place:
and when a thing is either done or said figuratively, it is no lie.
For every utterance is to be referred to that which it utters. But
when any thing is either done or said figuratively, it utters that
which it signifies to those for whose understanding it was put
forth. Whence we may believe in regard of those persons of the
prophetical times who are set forth as authoritative, that in all
that is written of them they acted and spoke prophetically; and no
less, that there is a prophetical meaning in all those incidents of
their lives which by the same prophetic Spirit have been accounted
worthy of being recorded in writing. As to the midwives, indeed,
they cannot say that these women did through the prophetic Spirit,
with purpose of signifying a future truth, tell Pharaoh one thing
instead of another, (albeit that Spirit did signify something,
without their knowing what was doing in their persons:) but, they
say that these women were according to their degree approved and
rewarded of God. For if a person who is used to tell lies for
harm&#8217;s sake comes to tell them for the sake of doing good, that
person has made great progress. But it is one thing that is set
forth as laudable in itself, another that in comparison with a
worse is preferred. It is one sort of gratulation that we express
when a man is in sound health, another when a sick man is getting
better. In the Scripture, even Sodom is said to be <pb n="461" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_461.html" id="v.v.viii-Page_461"/>justified in
comparison with the crimes of the people Israel. And to this rule
they apply all the instances of lying which are produced from the
Old Books, and are found not reprehended, or cannot be reprehended:
either they are approved on the score of a progress towards
improvement and hope of better things, or in virtue of some hidden
signification they are not altogether lies.</p>

8. For this reason, from the

pre-significations used by our Lord, if thou consider the life and

to the Jewish rite; but he did so, out of that liberty of his mind
whereby he preached that neither are the Gentiles the better for
circumcision, nor the Jews the worse. Wherefore he judged that
neither the former should be tied to the custom of the Jews, nor
the Jews deterred from the custom of their fathers. Whence are
those words of his: &#8220;Is any man called being circumcised let him
not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him
not be circumcised. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is
nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. Let every man

circumcision is become uncircumcision.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2315" id="v.v.ix-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.ix-p6"> <scripRef passage="Rom. ii. 25" id="v.v.ix-p6.2" parsed="|Rom|2|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.2.25">Rom. ii. 25</scripRef></p></note> And this the Apostle said, not as
though he would compel either those to remain in uncircumcision, or
the Jews in the custom of their fathers: but that neither these nor
those should be forced to the other custom; and, each should have
power of abiding in his own custom, not necessity of so doing. For
neither if the Jew should wish, where it would disturb no man, to
recede from Jewish observances, would he be prohibited by the
Apostle, since the object of his counselling to abide therein was
that Jews might not by being troubled about superfluous things be
hindered from coming to those things which are necessary to
salvation. Neither would it be prohibited by him, if any of the
Gentiles should wish to be circumcised for the purpose of showing
that he does not detest the same as noxious, but holds it
indifferently, as a seal,<note place="end" n="2316" id="v.v.ix-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.ix-p7"> <i>Signaculum</i></p></note> the usefulness of which had
already passed away with time; for it did not follow that, if there
were now no salvation to be had from it, there was destruction to
be dreaded therefrom. And for this reason, Timothy, having been
called in uncircumcision, yet because his mother was a Jewess and
he was bound, in order to gain his kindred, to show them that he
had not learnt in the Christian discipline to abominate the
sacraments of the old Law, was circumcised by the Apostle;<note place="end" n="2317" id="v.v.ix-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.ix-p8"> <scripRef passage="Acts xvi. 1-3" id="v.v.ix-p8.2" parsed="|Acts|16|1|16|3" osisRef="Bible:Acts.16.1-Acts.16.3">Acts xvi. 1&#8211;3</scripRef></p></note> that in
this way they might prove to the Jews, that the reason why the
Gentiles do not receive them, is not that they are evil and were
perniciously observed by the Fathers, but because they are no
longer necessary to salvation after the advent of that so great
Sacrament, which through so long times the whole of that ancient
Scripture in its prophetical prefigurations did travail in birth
withal. For he would circumcise Titus also, when the Jews urged
this,<note place="end" n="2318" id="v.v.ix-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.ix-p9"> <scripRef passage="Gal. ii. 3, 4" id="v.v.ix-p9.2" parsed="|Gal|2|3|2|4" osisRef="Bible:Gal.2.3-Gal.2.4">Gal. ii. 3, 4</scripRef></p></note> but that
false brethren, privily brought in, wished it to be done to the
intent they might have it to disseminate concerning Paul himself as
a token that he had given place to the truth of their preaching,
who said that the hope of Gospel salvation is in circumcision of
the flesh and observances of that kind, and that without these
Christ profiteth no man: whereas on the contrary Christ would
nothing profit them, who should be circumcised because they thought
that in it was salvation; whence that saying, &#8220;Behold, I Paul say
unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you
nothing.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2319" id="v.v.ix-p9.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.ix-p10"> <scripRef passage="Gal. v. 2" id="v.v.ix-p10.2" parsed="|Gal|5|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.5.2">Gal. v. 2</scripRef></p></note> Out of
this liberty, therefore, did Paul keep the observances of his
fathers, but with this one precaution and express declaration, that
people should not suppose that without these was no Christian
salvation. Peter, however, by his making as though salvation
consisted in Judaism, was compelling the Gentiles to judaize; as is
shown by Paul&#8217;s words, where he says, &#8220;Why compellest thou the
Gentiles to live as do the Jews?&#8221;<note place="end" n="2320" id="v.v.ix-p10.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.ix-p11"> <scripRef passage="Gal. ii. 14" id="v.v.ix-p11.2" parsed="|Gal|2|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.2.14">Gal. ii. 14</scripRef></p></note> For they would be under no
compulsion unless they saw that he observed them in such manner as
if beside them could be no salvation. Peter&#8217;s simulation
therefore is not to be compared to Paul&#8217;s liberty. And while we
ought to love Peter for that he willingly received correction, we
must not bolster up lying even by the authority of Paul, who
<pb n="462" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_462.html" id="v.v.ix-Page_462"/>both
recalled Peter to the right path in the presence of them all, lest
the Gentiles through him should be compelled to judaize; and bare
witness to his own preaching, that whereas he was accounted hostile
to the traditions of the fathers in that he would not impose them
on the Gentiles, he did not despise to celebrate them himself
according to the custom of his fathers, and therein sufficiently
showed that this has remained in them at the Coming of Christ; that
neither to the Jews they are pernicious, nor to the Gentiles
necessary, nor henceforth to any of mankind means of salvation.<note place="end" n="2321" id="v.v.ix-p11.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.ix-p12"> <i>Salutares</i></p></note></p>

9. But if no authority for
lying can be alleged, neither from the ancient Books, be it because
that is not a lie which is received to have been done or said in a
figurative sense, or be it because good men are not challenged to
imitate that which in bad men, beginning to amend, is praised in
comparison with the worse; nor yet from the books of the New
Testament, because Peter&#8217;s correction rather than his simulation,
even as his tears rather than his denial, is what we must imitate:
then, as to those examples which are fetched from common life, they
assert much more confidently that there is no trust to be given to
these. For first they teach, that a lie is iniquity, by many proofs
of holy writ, especially by that which is written, &#8220;Thou, Lord,
hatest all workers of iniquity, thou shall destroy them that speak
leasing.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2322" id="v.v.x-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.x-p2"> <scripRef passage="Ps. v. 5, 6" id="v.v.x-p2.2" parsed="|Ps|5|5|5|6" osisRef="Bible:Ps.5.5-Ps.5.6">Ps. v. 5, 6</scripRef>. [See
R.V.]</p></note> For either
as the Scripture is wont, in the following clause it expounds the
former; so that, as iniquity is a term of a wider meaning, leasing
is named as the particular sort of iniquity intended: or if they
think there is any difference between the two, leasing is by so
much worse than iniquity as &#8220;thou wilt destroy&#8221; is heavier than
&#8220;thou hatest.&#8221; For it may be that God hates a person to that
degree more mildly, as not to destroy him, but whom He destroys He
hates the more exceedingly, by how much He punisheth more severely.
Now He hateth all who work iniquity: but all who speak leasing He
also destroyeth. Which thing being fixed, who of them which assert
this will be moved by those examples, when it is said, suppose a
man should seek shelter with thee who by thy lie may be saved from
death? For that death which men are foolishly afraid of who are not
afraid to sin, kills not the soul but the body, as the Lord
teacheth in the Gospel; whence He charges us not to fear that
death:<note place="end" n="2323" id="v.v.x-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.x-p3"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 10.28" id="v.v.x-p3.1" parsed="|Matt|10|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.28">Matt. x. 28</scripRef></p></note> but the
mouth which lies kills not the body but the soul. For in these

himself that man, for whom that he may secure a temporal life,
himself loseth life eternal? Since if for his temporal life he lose
but his own temporal life, that is not to love as himself, but more
than himself: which exceeds the rule of sound doctrine. Much less
then is he by telling a lie to lose his own eternal for another&#8217;s
temporal life. His own temporal life, of course, for his
neighbor&#8217;s eternal life a Christian man will not hesitate to
lose: for this example has gone before, that the Lord died for us.
To this point He also saith, &#8220;This is my commandment, that ye
love one another as I have loved you. Greater love hath no man than
this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2326" id="v.v.x-p5.4"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.x-p6"> <scripRef passage="John xv. 12, 13" id="v.v.x-p6.2" parsed="|John|15|12|15|13" osisRef="Bible:John.15.12-John.15.13">John xv. 12, 13</scripRef></p></note> For none
is so foolish as to say that the Lord did other than consult for
the eternal salvation of men, whether in doing what He hath charged
us to do, or in charging us to do what Himself hath done. Since
then by lying eternal life is lost, never for any man&#8217;s temporal
life must a lie be told. And as to those who take it ill and are
indignant that one should refuse to tell a lie, and thereby slay
his own soul in order that another may grow old in the flesh; what
if by our committing theft, what if by committing adultery, a
person might be delivered from death: are we therefore to steal, to
commit whoredom? They cannot prevail with themselves in a case of
this kind: namely, if a person should bring a halter and demand
that one should yield to his carnal lust, declaring that he will
hang himself unless his request be granted: they cannot prevail
with themselves to comply for the sake of, as they say, saving a
life. If this is absurd and wicked, why should a man corrupt his
own soul with a lie in order that another may live in the body,
when, if he were to give his body to be corrupted with such an
object, he would in the judgment of all men be held guilty of
nefarious turpitude? Therefore the only point to be attended to in
this question is, whether a lie be iniquity. And since this is
asserted by the texts above rehearsed, we must see that to ask,
whether a man ought to tell a lie for the safety of another, is
just the same as asking whether for another&#8217;s safety a
<pb n="463" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_463.html" id="v.v.x-Page_463"/>man
ought to commit iniquity. But if the salvation of the soul rejects
this, seeing it cannot be secured but by equity, and would have us
prefer it not only to another&#8217;s, but even to our own temporal
safety: what remains, say they, that should make us doubt that a
lie ought not to be told under any circumstances whatsoever? For it
cannot be said that there is aught among temporal goods greater or
dearer than the safety and life of the body. Wherefore if not even
that is to be preferred to truth, what can be put in our way for
the sake of which they who think it is sometimes right to lie, can
urge that a lie ought to be told?</p>

10. As concerning purity of
body; here indeed a very honorable regard seems to come in the way,
and to demand a lie in its behalf; to wit, that if the assault of
the ravisher may be escaped by means of a lie, it is indubitably
right to tell it: but to this it may easily be answered, that there
is no purity of body except as it depends on integrity of mind;
this being broken, the other must needs fall, even though it seem
intact; and for this reason it is not to be reckoned among temporal
things, as a thing that might be taken away from people against
their will. By no means therefore must the mind corrupt itself by a
lie for the sake of its body, which it knows remaineth incorrupt if
from the mind itself incorruptness depart not. For that which by
violence, with no lust foregoing, the body suffereth, is rather to
be called deforcement than corruption. Or if all deforcement is
corruption, then not every corruption hath turpitude, but only that
which lust hath procured, or to which lust hath consented. Now by
how much the mind is more excellent than the body, so much the more
heinous is the wickedness if that be corrupted. There, then, purity
can be preserved, because there none but a voluntary corruption can
have place. For assuredly if the ravisher assault the body, and
there is no escaping him either by contrary force, or by any
contrivance or lie, we must needs allow that purity cannot be
violated by another&#8217;s lust. Wherefore, since no man doubts that
the mind is better than the body, to integrity of body we ought to
prefer integrity of mind, which can be preserved for ever. Now who
will say that the mind of him who tells a lie hath its integrity?
Indeed lust itself is rightly defined, An appetite of the mind by
which to eternal goods any temporal goods whatever are preferred.
Therefore no man can prove that it is at any time right to tell a
lie, unless he be able to show that any eternal good can be
obtained by a lie. But since each man departs from eternity just in
so far as he departs from truth, it is most absurd to say, that by
departing therefrom it is possible for any man to attain to any
good. Else if there be any eternal good which truth compriseth not,
it will not be a true good, therefore neither will it be good,
because it will be false. But as the mind to the body, so must also
truth be preferred to the mind itself, so that the mind should
desire it not only more than the body, but even more than its own
self. So will the mind be more entire and chaste, when it shall
enjoy the immutability of truth rather than its own mutability. Now
if Lot,<note place="end" n="2327" id="v.v.xi-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.xi-p2"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xix. 8" id="v.v.xi-p2.2" parsed="|Gen|19|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.19.8">Gen. xix. 8</scripRef></p></note> being so

his daughters to the lust of the Sodomites, to the intent, that the
bodies of women rather than of men might be corrupted by them; how
much more diligently and constantly ought the mind&#8217;s chasteness
in the truth to be preserved, seeing it is more truly preferable to
its body, than the body of a man to the body of a
woman?</p>

11. But if any man supposes
that the reason why it is right for a person to tell a lie for
another is, that he may live the while, or not be offended in those
things which he much loveth, to the end he may attain unto eternal
truth by being taught: that man doth not understand, in the first
place, that there is no flagitious thing which he may not upon the
same ground be compelled to commit, as has been above demonstrated;
and in the next place, that the authority of the doctrine itself is
cut off and altogether undone if those whom we essay to bring
thereunto, are by our lie made to think that it is somewhiles right
to lie. For seeing the doctrine which bringeth salvation consisteth
partly in things to be believed, partly in things to be understood;
and there is no attaining unto those things which are to be
understood, unless first those things are believed, which are to be
believed; how can there be any believing one who thinks it is
sometimes right to lie, lest haply he lie at the moment when he
teacheth us to believe? For how can it be known whether he have at
that moment some cause, as he thinks, for a well-meant<note place="end" n="2329" id="v.v.xii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.xii-p2"> <i>Officiosi</i></p></note> lie,
deeming that by a false story a man may be frightened and kept from
lust, and in this way account that by telling a lie he is doing
good even in spiritual things? Which kind of lie once admitted and
approved, all discipline of faith is subverted altogether; and this
being subverted, neither is there any attaining to understanding,
for the receiving of which that discipline nurtur<pb n="464" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_464.html" id="v.v.xii-Page_464"/>eth the
babes: and so all the doctrine of truth is done away, giving place
to most licentious falsehood, if a lie, even well-meant, may from
any quarter have place opened for it to enter in. For either whoso
tells a lie prefers temporal advantages, his own or another&#8217;s, to
truth; than which what can be more perverse? or when by aid of a
lie he wishes to make a person fit for gaining the truth, he bars
the approach to truth, for by wishing when he lies to be
accommodating,<note place="end" n="2330" id="v.v.xii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.xii-p3"> <i>Aptus</i></p></note> it comes
to pass that when he speaks the truth, he cannot be depended upon.
Wherefore, either we must not believe good men, or we must believe
those whom we think obliged sometimes to tell a lie, or we must not
believe that good men sometimes tell lies: of these three the first
is pernicious, the second foolish; it remains therefore that good
men should never tell lies.</p>

12. Thus has the question
been on both sides considered and treated; and still it is not easy
to pass sentence: but we must further lend diligent hearing to
those who say, that no deed is so evil, but that in avoidance of a
worse it ought to be done; moreover that the deeds of men include
not only what they do, but whatever they consent to be done unto
them. Wherefore, if cause have arisen that a Christian man should
choose to burn incense to idols, that he might not consent to
bodily defilement which the persecutor threatened him withal,
unless he should do so, they think they have a right to ask why he
should not also tell a lie to escape so foul a disgrace. For the
consent itself to endure violation of the person rather than to
burn incense to idols, this, they say, is not a passive thing, but
a deed; which rather than do, he chose to burn incense. How much
more readily then would he have chosen a lie, if by a lie he might
ward off from a holy body so shocking a disgrace?</p>
</div3>

13. In which proposition
these points may well deserve to be questioned: whether such
consent is to be accounted as a deed: or whether that is to be
called consent which hath not approbation: or whether it be
approbation, when it is said, &#8220;It is expedient to suffer this
rather than do that;&#8221; and whether the person spoken of did right
to burn incense rather than suffer violation of his body; and
whether it would be right rather to tell a lie, if that was the
alternative proposed, than to burn incense? But if such consent is
to be accounted as a deed, then are they murderers who have chosen
rather to be put to death than bear false witness, yea, what is
worse, they are murderers of themselves. For why, at this rate,
should it not be said that they have slain themselves, because they
chose that this should be done to them that they might not do what
they were urged to do? Or, if it be accounted a worse thing to slay
another than himself, what if these terms were offered to a Martyr,
that, upon his refusing to bear false witness of Christ and to
sacrifice to demons, then, before his eyes, not some other man, but
his own father should be put to death; his father entreating him
that he would not by his persevering permit that to be done? Is it
not manifest, that, upon his remaining steadfast in his purpose of
most faithful testimony, they alone would be the murderers who
should slay his father, and not he a parricide into the bargain? As
therefore, in this case, the man would be no party to this so
heinous deed, for choosing, rather than violate his faith by false
testimony, that his own father should be put to death by others,
(yea, though that father were a sacrilegious person whose soul
would be snatched away to punishment;) so the like consent, in the
former case, would not make him a party to that so foul disgrace,
if he refused to do evil himself, let others do what they might in
consequence of his not doing it. For what do such persecutors say,
but, &#8220;Do evil that we may not?&#8221; If the case were so, that our
doing evil would make them not to have done it, even then it would
not be our duty by doing wickedness ourselves to vote them
harmless; but as in fact they are already doing it when they say
nothing of the kind,<note place="end" n="2331" id="v.v.xiv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.xiv-p2"> Al. <i>when they say such
things</i>.</p></note> why are they to have us to keep
them company in wickedness rather than be vile and noisome by
themselves? For that is not to be called consent; seeing that we do
not approve what they do, always wishing that they would not, and,
as much as in us lies, hindering them that they should not do it,
and, when it is done, not only not committing it with them, but
with all possible detestation condemning the same.</p>

14. &#8220;How,&#8221; sayest thou,
&#8220;is it not his doing as well as theirs, when they would not do
this, if he would do that?&#8221; Why, at this rate we go housebreaking
with house-breakers, because if we did not shut the door, they
would not break it open: and we go and murder with highwaymen, if
it chance we know that they are going to do it, because if we
killed them out of hand, they would not kill others. Or, if a
person confess to us that he is going to commit a parricide, we
commit it along with him, if, being able, we do not slay him before
he can do the deed when we can<pb n="465" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_465.html" id="v.v.xv-Page_465"/>not in some other way prevent
or thwart him. For it may be said, word for word as before, &#8220;Thou
hast done it as well as he; for he had not done this, hadst thou
done that.&#8221; With my good will, neither ill should be done; but
only the one was in my power, and I could take care that this
should not be done; the other rested with another, and when by my
good advice I could not quench the purpose, I was not bound by my
evil deed to thwart the doing. It is therefore no approving of a
sinner, that one refuses to sin for him; and neither the one nor
the other is liked by him who would that neither were done; but in
that which pertains to him, he hath the power to do it or not, and
with that he perpetrateth it not; in that which pertains to
another, he hath only the will to wish it or not, and with that he
condemneth. And therefore, on their offering those terms, and
saying, &#8220;If thou burn not incense, this shalt thou suffer;&#8221; if
he should answer, &#8220;For me, I choose neither, I detest both, I
consent unto you in none of these things:&#8221; in uttering these and
the like words, which certainly, because they would be true, would
afford them no consent no approbation of his, let him suffer at
their hands what he might, to his account would be set down the
receipt of wrongs, to theirs the commission of sins. &#8220;Ought he
then,&#8221; it may be asked, &#8220;to suffer his person to be violated
rather than burn incense?&#8221; If the question be what he ought, he
ought to do neither. For should I say that he ought to do any of
these things, I shall approve this or that, whereas I reprobate
both. But if the question be, which of these he ought in preference
to avoid, not being able to avoid both but able to avoid one or
other: I will answer, &#8220;His own sin, rather than another&#8217;s; and
rather a lighter sin being his own, than a heavier being
another&#8217;s.&#8221; For, reserving the point for more diligent inquiry,
and granting in the mean while that violation of the person is
worse than burning incense, yet the latter is his own, the former
another&#8217;s deed, although he had it done to him; now, whose the
deed, his the sin. For though murder is a greater sin than
stealing, yet it is worse to steal than to suffer murder.
Therefore, if it were proposed to any man that, if he would not
steal he should be killed, that is, murder should be committed upon
him; being he could not avoid both, he would prefer to avoid that
which would be his own sin, rather than that which would be
another&#8217;s. Nor would the latter become his act for being
committed upon him, and because he might avoid it if he would
commit a sin of his own.</p>

15. The whole stress, then,
of this question comes to this; whether it be true universally that
no sin of another, committed upon thee, is to be imputed to thee,
if, being able to avoid it by a lighter sin of thine own, thou do
it not; or whether there be an exception of all bodily defilement.
No man says that a person is defiled by being murdered, or cast
into prison, or bound in chains, or scourged, or afflicted with
other tortures and pains, or proscribed and made to suffer most
grievous losses even to utter nakedness, or stripped of honors, and
subjected to great disgrace by reproaches of whatsoever kind;
whatever of all these a man may have unjustly suffered, no man is
so senseless as to say that he is thereby defiled. But if he have
filth poured all over him, or poured into his mouth, or crammed
into him, or if he be carnally used like a woman; then almost all
men regard him with a feeling of horror, and they call him defiled
and unclean. One must conclude then that the sins of others, be
they what they may, those always excepted which defile him on whom
they are committed, a man must not seek to avoid by sin of his own,
either for himself or for any other, but rather he must put up with
them, and suffer bravely; and if by no sins of his own he ought to
avoid them, therefore not by a lie: but those which by being
committed upon a man do make him unclean, these we are bound to
avoid even by sinning ourselves; and for this reason those things
are not to be called sins, which are done for the purpose of
avoiding that uncleanness. For whatever is done, in consideration
that the not doing it were just cause of blame, that thing is not
sin. Upon the same principle, neither is that to be called
uncleanness when there is no way of avoiding it; for even in that
extremity he who suffers it has what he may do aright, namely,
patiently bear what he cannot avoid. Now no man while acting aright
can be defiled by any corporal contagion. For the unclean in the
sight of God is every one who is unrighteous; clean therefore is
every one who is righteous; if not in the sight of men, yet in the
sight of God, Who judges without error. Nay, even in the act of
suffering that defilement with power given of avoiding it, it is
not by the mere contact that the man is defiled; but by the sin of
refusing to avoid it when he might. For that would be no sin,
whatever might be done for the avoiding of it. Whoever therefore,
for the avoiding of it, shall tell a lie, sinneth not.</p>

16. Or, are some lies, also,
to be excepted, so that it were better to suffer this than to
commit those? If so, then not every thing 
<pb n="466" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_466.html" id="v.v.xvii-Page_466"/>that is done in order to
the avoiding of that defilement ceases to be sin; seeing there are
some lies to commit which is worse than to suffer that foul
violence. For, suppose quest be making after a person that his body
may be deflowered, and that it be possible to screen him by a lie;
who dares to say that even in such a case a lie ought not be told?
But, if the lie by which he may be concealed be one which may hurt
the fair fame of another, by bringing upon him a false accusation
of that very uncleanness, to suffer which the other is sought
after; as, if it should be said to the inquirer, &#8220;Go to such an
one,&#8221; (naming some chaste man who is a stranger to vices of this
kind,) &#8220;and he will procure for you one whom you will find a more
willing subject, for he knows and loves such;&#8221; and thereby the
person might be diverted from him whom he sought: I know not
whether one man&#8217;s fair fame ought to be violated by a lie, in
order that another&#8217;s body may not be violated by lust to which he
is a stranger. And in general, it is never right to tell a lie for
any man, such as may hurt another, even if the hurt be slighter
than would be the hurt to him unless such a lie were told. Because
neither must another man&#8217;s bread be taken from him against his
will, though he be in good health, and it is to feed one who is
weak; nor must an innocent man, against his will, be beaten with
rods, that another may not be killed. Of course, if they are
willing, let it be done, because they are not hurt if they be
willing that so it should be: but whether, even with his own
consent, a man&#8217;s fair fame ought to be hurt with a false charge
of foul lusts, in order that lust may be averted from another&#8217;s
body, is a great question. And I know not whether it be easy to
find in what way it can be just that a man&#8217;s fair fame, even with
his consent, should be stained with a false charge of lust, any
more than a man&#8217;s body should be polluted by the lust itself
against his will.</p>

17. But yet if the option
were proposed to the man who chose to burn incense to idols rather
than yield his body to abominable lust, that, if he wished to avoid
that, he should violate the fame of Christ by some lie; he would be
most mad to do it. I say more: that he would be mad, if, to avoid
another man&#8217;s lust, and not to have that done upon his person
which he would suffer with no lust of his own, he should falsify
Christ&#8217;s Gospel with false praises of Christ; more eschewing that
another man should corrupt his body, than himself to corrupt the
doctrine of sanctification of souls and bodies. Wherefore, from the
doctrine of religion, and from those utterances universally, which
are uttered on behalf of the doctrine of religion, in the teaching
and learning of the same, all lies must be utterly kept aloof. Nor
can any cause whatever be found, one should think, why a lie should
be told in matters of this kind, when in this doctrine it is not
right to tell a lie for the very purpose of bringing a person to it
the more easily. For, once break or but slightly diminish the
authority of truth, and all things will remain doubtful: which
unless they be believed true, cannot be held as certain. It is
lawful then either to him that discourses, disputes, and preaches
of things eternal, or to him that narrates or speaks of things
temporal pertaining to edification of religion and piety, to
conceal at fitting time whatever seems fit to be concealed: but to
tell a lie is never lawful, therefore neither to conceal by telling
a lie.</p>

18. This being from the very
first and most firmly established, touching other lies the question
proceeds more securely. But by consequence we must also see that
all lies must be kept aloof which hurt any man unjustly: because no
man is to have a wrong, albeit a lighter one is done to him, that
another may have a heavier kept from him. Nor are those lies to be
allowed, which, though they hurt not another, yet do nobody any
good, and are hurtful to the persons themselves who gratuitously
tell them. Indeed, these are the persons who are properly to be
called liars. For there is a difference between lying and being a
liar. A man may tell a lie unwillingly; but a liar loves to lie,
and inhabits in his mind in the delight of lying. Next to such are
those to be placed who by a lie wish to please men, not that they
may do wrong or bring reproach upon any man; for we have already
before put away that kind; but that they may be pleasant in
conversation. These, differ from the class in which we have placed
liars in this respect, that liars delight in lying, rejoicing in
deceit for its own sake: but these lust to please by agreeable
talk, and yet would rather please by saying things that were true,
but when they do not easily find true things to say that are
pleasant to the hearers, they choose rather to tell lies than to
hold their tongues. Yet it is difficult for these sometimes to
undertake a story which is the whole of it false; but most commonly
they interweave falsehood with truth, where they are at a loss for
something sweet. Now these two sorts of lies do no harm to those
who believe them, because they are not deceived concerning any
matter of religion and truth, or concerning any profit or advantage
of their own. It <pb n="467" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_467.html" id="v.v.xix-Page_467"/>suffices them, to judge the
thing possible which is told, and to have faith in a man of whom
they ought not rashly to think that he is telling a lie. For where
is the harm of believing that such an one&#8217;s father or grandfather
was a good man, when he was not? or that he has served with the
army even in Persia, though he never set foot out of Rome? But to
the persons who tell these lies, they do much harm: to the former
sort, because they so desert truth as to rejoice in deceit: to the
latter, because they want to please people better than the
truth.</p>

19. These sorts of lies
having been without any hesitation condemned, next follows a sort,
as it were by steps rising to something better, which is commonly
attributed to well-meaning and good people, when the person who
lies not only does no harm to another, but even benefits somebody.
Now it is on this sort of lies that the whole dispute turns,
whether that person does harm to himself, who benefits another in
such sort as to act contrary to the truth. Or, if that alone may be
called truth which illustrateth the very minds of men with an
intimate and incommutable light, at least he acts contrary to some
true thing, because although the bodily senses are deceived, yet he
acts contrary to a true thing who says that a thing is so or not
so, whereof neither his mind nor senses nor his opinion or belief
giveth him any report. Whether therefore he does not hurt himself
in so profiting another, or in that compensation not hurt himself
in which he profiteth the other, is a great question. If it be so,
it should follow that he ought to profit himself by a lie which
damages no man. But these things hang together, and if you concede
that point, it necessarily draws in its train some very
embarrassing consequences. For should it be asked, what harm it
does to a person rolling in superfluous wealth, if from countless
thousands of bushels of wheat he lose one bushel, which bushel may
be profitable as necessary food to the person stealing it; it will
follow that theft also may be committed without blame, and false
witness borne without sin. Than which, what can be mentioned more
perverse? Or truly, if another had stolen the bushel, and thou
sawest it done, and wert questioned, wouldest thou tell a lie with
honesty for the poor man, and if thou do it for thine own poverty
wilt thou be blamed? As if it were thy duty to love another more
than thyself. Both then are disgraceful, and must be
avoided.</p>

20. But haply some may think
that there is an exception to be added; that there be some honest
lies which not only hurt no man, but profit some man, excepting
those by which crimes are screened and defended: so that the reason
why the aforesaid lie is disgraceful, is that, although it hurt no
man, and profit the poor, it screens a theft; but if it should in
such sort hurt nobody and profit somebody as not to screen and
defend any sin, it would not be morally wrong. As, put the case
that some one should in thy sight hide his money that he might not
lose it by theft or violence, and thereupon being questioned thou
shouldest tell a lie; thou wouldest hurt no man, and wouldest serve
him who had need that his money were hidden, and wouldest not have
covered a sin by telling a lie. For it is no sin if a man hide his
property which he fears to lose. But, if we therefore sin not in
telling a lie, for that, while covering no man&#8217;s sin, we hurt
nobody and do good to somebody, what are we about as concerning the
sin itself of a lie? For where it is laid down, &#8220;Thou shalt not
steal,&#8221; there is also this, &#8220;Thou shall not bear false
witness.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2332" id="v.v.xxi-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.xxi-p2"> <scripRef passage="Exodus xx. 15, 16" id="v.v.xxi-p2.2" parsed="|Exod|20|15|20|16" osisRef="Bible:Exod.20.15-Exod.20.16">Exodus xx. 15, 16</scripRef></p></note> Since then

shall we say? Is it so, that there is no &#8220;false witness,&#8221; but
when one tells a lie either to invent a crime against some man, or
to hide some man&#8217;s crime, or in any way to oppress any man in
judgment? For a witness seems to be necessary to the judge for
cognizance of the cause. But if the Scripture named a &#8220;witness&#8221;
only so far as that goes, the Apostle would not say, &#8220;Yea, and we

22. What then, if a homicide
seek refuge with a Christian, or if he see where the homicide have
taken refuge, and be questioned of this matter by him who seeks, in
order to bring to punishment a man, the slayer of man? Is he to
tell a lie? For how does he not hide a sin by lying, when he for
whom he lies has been guilty of a heinous sin? Or is it because he
is not questioned concerning his sin, but about the place where he
is concealed? So then to lie in order to hide a person&#8217;s sin is
evil; but to lie in order to hide the sinner is not evil? &#8220;Yea,
surely:&#8221; says some one: &#8220;for a man sins not in avoiding
punishment, but in doing something worthy of punishment. Moreover,
it pertaineth to Christian discipline neither to despair of any
man&#8217;s amendment, nor to bar against any man the way of
repentance.&#8221; What if thou be led to the judge, and then
questioned concerning the very place where the other is in hiding?
Art thou prepared to say, either, &#8220;He is not there,&#8221; when thou
knowest him to be there; or, &#8220;I know not, and have not seen,&#8221;
what thou knowest and hast seen? Art thou then prepared to bear
false witness, and to slay thy soul that a manslayer may not be
slain? Or, up to the presence of the judge wilt thou lie, but when
the judge questions thee, then speak truth that thou be not a false
witness? So then thou art going to slay a man thyself by betraying
him. Surely the betrayer too is one whom the divine Scripture
detesteth. Or haply is he no betrayer, who in answer to the
judge&#8217;s interrogation gives true information; but would be a
betrayar, if, unasked, he should delate a man to his destruction?
Put the case with respect to a just and innocent man, that thou
know where he is in hiding, and be questioned by the judge; which
man, however, has been ordered to be taken to execution by a higher
power, so that he who interrogates is charged with the execution of
the law, not the author of the sentence? Will it be no false
witness that thou shall lie for an innocent man, because the
interrogator is not a judge, but only charged with the execution?
What if the author of the law interrogate thee, or any unjust
judge, making quest of an innocent man to bring him to punishment?
What wilt thou do? wilt thou be false witness, or betrayer? Or will
he be a betrayer, who to a just judge shall ultroneously delate a
lurking homicide; and he not so, who to an unjust judge,
interrogating him of the hiding-place of an innocent man whom he
seeks to slay, shall inform against the person who has thrown
himself upon his honor? Or between the crime of false witness and
that of betrayal, wilt thou remain doubtful and unable to make up
thy mind? Or by holding thy peace or professing that thou wilt not
tell, wilt thou make up thy mind to avoid both? Then why not do
this before thou come to the judge, that thou mayest shun the lie
also? For, having kept clear of a lie, thou wilt escape all false
witness; whether every lie be false witness, or not every: but by
keeping clear of all false witness in thy sense of the word, thou
wilt not escape all lying. How much braver then, how much more
excellent, to say, &#8220;I will neither betray nor lie?&#8221;</p>

23. This did a former Bishop
of the Church of Thagasta, Firmus by name, and even more firm in
will. For, when he was asked by command of the emperor, through
officers sent by him, for a man who was taking refuge with him, and
whom he kept in hiding with all possible care, he made answer to
their questions, that he could neither tell a lie, nor betray a
man; and when he had suffered so many torments of body, (for as yet
emperors were not Christian,) he stood firm in his purpose.
Thereupon being brought before the emperor, his conduct appeared so
admirable, that he without any difficulty obtained a pardon for the
man whom he was trying to save. What conduct could be more brave
and constant? But peradventure some more timid person may say, &#8220;I
can be prepared to bear any torments, or even to submit to death,
that I may not sin; but, since it is no sin to tell a lie such that
you neither hurt any man, nor bear false witness, and benefit some
man, it is foolish and a great sin, voluntarily and to no purpose
to submit to torments, and, when one&#8217;s health and life may haply
be useful, to fling them away for nothing to people in a rage.&#8221;

24. But one sometimes comes
to a case of this kind, that we are not interrogated where the
person is who is sought, nor forced to betray him, if he is hidden
in such manner, that he cannot easily be found unless betrayed: but
we are asked, whether he be in such a place or not. If we know him
to be there, by holding our peace we betray him, or even by saying
that we will in no wise tell whether he be there or not: for from
this the questioner gathers that he is there, as, if he were not,
nothing else would be answered by him who would not lie nor betray
a man, but only, that he is not there. So, by our either holding
our peace, or saying such words, a man is betrayed, and he who
seeks him hath but to enter in, if he have the power, and find him:
whereas he might have been turned aside from finding him by our
telling a lie. Wherefore if thou know not where he is, there is no
cause for hiding the truth, but thou must confess that thou knowest
not. But, if thou know where he is, whether he be in the place
which is named in the question or elsewhere; thou must not say,
when it is asked whether he be there or not, &#8220;I will not tell
thee what thou askest,&#8221; but thou must say, &#8220;I know where he is,
but I will never show.&#8221; For if, touching one place in particular
thou answer not and profess that thou wilt not betray, it is just
as if thou shouldest point to that same place with thy finger: for
a sure suspicion is thereby excited. But if at the first thou
confess that thou know where he is, but will not tell, haply the
inquisitor may be diverted from that place, and begin now to ply
thee that the place where he is may be betrayed. For which good
faith and humanity whatever thou shall bravely bear, is judged to
be not only not culpable, but even laudable; save only these things
which if a man suffer he is said to suffer not bravely, but
immodestly and foully. For this is the last description of lie,
concerning which we must treat more diligently.</p>

25. For first to be eschewed
is that capital lie and far to be fled from, which is done in
doctrine of religion; to which lie a man ought by no consideration
to be induced. The second, that he should hurt some man unjustly:
which is such that it profits no man and hurts some man. The third,
which so profits one as to hurt another, but not in corporal
defilement. The fourth, that which is done through only lust of
lying and deceiving, which is an unmixed lie. The fifth, what is
done with desire of pleasing by agreeableness in talk. All these
being utterly eschewed and rejected, there follows a sixth sort
which at once hurts nobody and helps somebody; as when, if a
person&#8217;s money is to be unjustly taken from him, one who knows
where the money is, should say that he does not know, by whomsoever
the question be put. The seventh, which hurts none and profits
some: except if a judge interrogate: as when, not wishing to betray
a man who is sought for to be put to death, one should lie; not
only a just and innocent, but also a culprit; because it belongs to
Christian discipline neither to despair of any man&#8217;s amendment,
nor to bar the way of repentance against any. Of which two sorts,
which are wont to be attended with great controversy, we have
sufficiently treated, and have shown what was our judgment; that by
taking the consequences, which are honorably and bravely borne,
these kinds also should be eschewed by brave and faithful and
truthful men and women. The eighth sort of lie is that which hurts
no man, and does good in the preserving somebody from corporal
defilement, at least that defilement which we have mentioned above.
For even to eat with unwashen hands the Jews thought defilement. Or
if a person think this also a defilement, yet not such that a lie
ought to be told to avoid it. But if the lie be such as to do an
injury to any man, even though it screen a man from that
uncleanness which all men abhor and detest; whether a lie of this
kind may be told provided the injury done by the lie be such as
consists not in that sort of uncleanness with which we are now
concerned, is another question: for here the question is no longer
about lying, but it is asked whether an injury ought to be done to
any man, even otherwise than by a lie, that the said defilement may
be warded off from another. Which I should by no means think:
though the case proposed be the slightest wrongs, as that which I
mentioned above, about a single measure of wheat; and though it be
very embarrassing whether it be our duty not to do even such an
injury to any man, if thereby another may be defended or screened
from a lustful outrage upon his person. But, as I said, this is
another question: at present let us go on with what we have taken
in hand: whether a lie ought to be told, if even the inevitable
condition be proposed that we either do this, or suffer the deed of
lust or <pb n="470" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_470.html" id="v.v.xxvi-Page_470"/>some execrable pollution; even though by lying we do no
man harm.</p>

26. Touching which matter,
there will be some place open for consideration, if first the
divine authorities which forbid a lie be diligently discussed: for
if these give no place, we vainly seek a loophole; for we are bound
to keep in every way the command of God, and the will of God in all
that through keeping His command we may suffer, it is our duty with
an even mind to follow: but if by some relaxation any outlet be
allowed, in such a case we are not to decline a lie. The reason why
the Divine Scriptures contain not only God&#8217;s commands, but the
life and character of the just, is this: that, if haply it be
hidden in what way we are to take that which is enjoined, by the
actions of the just it may be understood. With the exception,
therefore, of those actions which one may refer to an allegorical
significance, although none doubts that they really took place, as
is the case with almost all the occurrences in the books of the Old
Testament. For who can venture to affirm of any thing there, that
it does not pertain to a figurative foretelling? Seeing the
Apostle, speaking of the sons of Abraham, of whom of course it is
most easily said that they were born and did live in the natural
order of propagating the people, (for not monsters and prodigies
were born, to lead the mind to some presignification,) nevertheless
asserteth that they signify the two Testaments;<note place="end" n="2337" id="v.v.xxvii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.xxvii-p2"> <scripRef passage="Gal. iv. 22-24" id="v.v.xxvii-p2.2" parsed="|Gal|4|22|4|24" osisRef="Bible:Gal.4.22-Gal.4.24">Gal. iv. 22&#8211;24</scripRef></p></note> and saith of that marvellous

perjury. And therefore he is not found to have sworn except in
writing, where there is more wary forethought, and no precipitate

heart, where is approved and decreed whatever also by the voice,
when we speak the truth, is uttered: so that he lieth with the
heart who approveth a lie; yet that man may possibly not lie with
the heart, who uttereth other than is in his mind, in such sort
that he knows it to be for the sake of avoiding a greater evil that
he admitteth an evil, disapproving withal both the one and the
other. And they who assert this, say that thus also is to be

always in the heart truth must be spoken; but not always in the
mouth of the body, if any cause of avoiding a greater evil require
that other than is in the mind be uttered with the voice. And that
there is indeed a mouth of the heart, may be understood even from
this, that where there is speech, there a mouth is with no
absurdity understood: nor would it be right to say, &#8220;Who speaketh
in his heart,&#8221; unless it were right to understand that there is
also a mouth in the heart. Though in that very place where it is
written, &#8220;The mouth that lieth, slayeth the soul,&#8221; if the
context of the lesson be considered, it may peradventure be taken
for no other than the mouth of the heart. For there is an obscure
response there, where it is hidden from men, to whom the mouth of
the heart, unless the mouth of the body sound therewith, is not
audible. But that mouth, the Scripture in that place saith, doth
reach to the hearing of the Spirit of the Lord, Who hath filled the
whole earth; at the same time mentioning lips and voice and tongue
in that place; yet all these the sense permitteth not to be taken,
but concerning the heart, because it saith of the Lord, that what
is spoken is not hidden from Him: now that which is spoken with
that sound which reacheth to our ears, is not hidden from men
either. Thus, namely, is it written: &#8220;The Spirit of wisdom is

reins God is witness, and of his heart a true searcher, and of his

32. Manifestly also in the
Gospel we find <pb n="472" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_472.html" id="v.v.xxxiii-Page_472"/>the mouth of the heart: so that
in one place the Lord is found to have mentioned the mouth both of
the body and of the heart, where he saith, &#8220;Are ye also yet
without understanding? Do ye not yet understand, that whatsoever
entereth in at the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out
into the draught? but those things which proceed out of the mouth
come forth from the heart, and they defile the man. For out of the
heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications,
thefts, false witness, blasphemies: these are the things which
defile a man.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2357" id="v.v.xxxiii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.xxxiii-p2"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 15.16-20" id="v.v.xxxiii-p2.1" parsed="|Matt|15|16|15|20" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.16-Matt.15.20">Matt. xv. 16&#8211;20</scripRef></p></note> Here if thou understand but one

peradventure a man is but then defiled when he eateth aught
unclean, but is defiled when he vomits it up. But if this be most
absurd, it remains that we understand the mouth of the heart to
have been expounded by the Lord, when He saith, &#8220;The things which
proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart.&#8221; For being
that theft also can be, and often is, perpetrated with silence of
the bodily voice and mouth; one must be out of his mind so to
understand it as then to account a person to be contaminated by the
sin of theft, when he confesses or makes it known, but when he
commits it and holds his peace, then to think him undefiled. But,
in truth, if we refer what is said to the mouth of the heart, no
sin whatever can be committed tacitly: for it is not committed
unless it proceed from that mouth which is within.</p>

of what mouth the Scripture saith, &#8220;The mouth that lieth, slayeth

&#8220;Keep yourselves from murmuring, which profiteth nothing, and

place through malevolence, when any man not only with mouth and

that a person is not to use any lie. Therefore, when one man shall
say, that according to this testimony of Scripture we must to that
degree hold every sort and kind of lie in detestation, that even if
a man wish to lie, yea, though he lie not, the very wish is to be
condemned; and to this sense interpreteth, that it is not said, Do
not use every lie, but, &#8220;Do not wish to use every lie;&#8221; that
one must not dare not only to tell, but not even to wish to tell,
any lie whatever: saith another man, &#8220;Nay, in that it saith, Do
not wish to use every lie, it willeth that from the mouth of the
heart we exterminate and estrange lying: so that while from some
lies we must abstain with the mouth of the body, as are those
chiefly which pertain to doctrine of religion; from some, we are
not to abstain with the mouth of the body, if reason of avoiding a
greater evil require; but with the mouth of the heart we must
abstain utterly from every lie.&#8221; Where it behoveth to be
understood what is said, &#8220;Do not wish:&#8221; namely, the will itself
is taken as it were the mouth of the heart, so that it concerneth
not the mouth of the heart when in shunning a greater evil we lie
unwillingly. There is also a third sense in which thou mayest so
take this word, &#8220;not every,&#8221; that, except some lies, it giveth
thee leave to lie. Like as if he should say, wish not to believe
every man: he would not mean to advise that none should be
believed; but that not all, some however, should be believed. And
that which follows, &#8220;For assiduity thereof will not profit for
good,&#8221; sounds as if, not lying, but assiduous lying, that is, the
custom and love of lying, should seem to be that which he would
prohibit. To which that person will assuredly slide down,<note place="end" n="2359" id="v.v.xxxv-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.xxxv-p3"> <i>Abutendum</i></p></note> who either
shall think that every lie may be boldly used (for so he will shun
not that even which is committed in the doctrine of piety and
religion; than which what more abominably wicked thing canst thou
easily find, not among all lies, but among all sins?) or to some
lie (no matter how easy, how harmless,) shall accommodate the
inclination of the will; so as to lie, not unwillingly for the sake
of escaping a greater evil, but willingly and with liking. So,
seeing there be three things which may be understood in this
sentence, either &#8220;Every lie, not only tell thou not, but do not
even wish to tell:&#8221; or, &#8220;Do not wish, but even unwillingly tell
a lie when aught worse is to be avoided:&#8221; or, &#8220;Not every,&#8221; to
wit, that except some lies, the rest are admitted: one of these is
found to make for those who hold that one is never to lie, two for
those who think that sometimes <pb n="473" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_473.html" id="v.v.xxxv-Page_473"/>one may tell a lie. But yet
what follows, &#8220;For assiduity thereof will not profit to good,&#8221;
I know not whether it can countenance the first sentence of these
three; except haply so, that while it is a precept for the perfect
not only not to lie, but not even to wish; assiduity of lying is
not permitted even to beginners. As if, namely, on laying down the
rule at no time whatever not merely to lie but so much as to have a
wish to lie, and this being gainsaid by examples, in regard that
there are some lies which have been even approved by great
authority, it should be rejoined that those indeed are lies of
beginners, which have, in regard of this life, some kind of duty of
mercy; and yet to that degree is every lie evil, and by perfect and
spiritual minds in every way to be eschewed, that not even
beginners are permitted to have assiduous custom thereof. For we
have already spoken concerning the Egyptian midwives, that it is in
respect of the promise of growth and proficiency to better things
that they while lying are spoken of with approval: because it is
some step towards loving the true and eternal saving of the soul,
when a person doth mercifully for the saving of any man&#8217;s albeit
mortal life even tell a lie.</p>

36. For, concerning false
witness, which is set down in the ten commands of the Law, it can
indeed in no wise be contended that love of truth may at heart be
preserved, and false witness brought forth to him unto whom the
witness is borne. For, when it is said to God only, then it is only
in the heart that the truth is to be embraced: but when it is said
to man, then must we with the mouth also of the body bring forth
truth, because man is not an inspector of the heart. But then,
touching the witness itself, it is not unreasonably asked, to whom
one is a witness? For not to whomsoever we speak unto are we
witnesses, but to them to whom it is expedient and due that they by
our means should come to know or believe the truth; as is a judge,
that he may not err in judging; or he who is taught in doctrine of
religion, that he may not err in faith, or by very authority of the
teacher waver in doubt. But when the person who interrogates thee
or wishes to know aught from thee seeks that which concerneth him
not, or which is not expedient for him to know, he craveth not a
witness, but a betrayer. Therefore if to him thou tell a lie, from
false witness peradventure thou wilt be clear, but from a lie
assuredly not. So then with this salvo, that to bear false witness
is never lawful, the question is, whether it be lawful sometimes to
tell a lie. Or if it be false witness to lie at all, it is to be
seen whether it admit of compensation, to wit, that it be said for
the sake of avoiding a greater sin: as that which is written,

38. Certain it is, albeit all
this disputation go from side to side, some asserting that it is
never right to lie, and to this effect reciting divine testimonies:
others gainsaying, and even in the midst of the very words of the
divine testimonies seeking place for a lie; yet no man can say,
that he finds this either in example or in word of the Scriptures,
that any lie should seem a thing to be loved, or not had in hatred;
howbeit sometimes by telling a lie thou must do that thou hatest,
that what is more greatly to be detested may be avoided. But then
here it is that people err; they put the precious beneath the vile.
For when thou hast granted that some evil is to be admitted, that
another and more grievous may not be admitted; not by the rule of
truth, but by his own cupidity and custom doth each measure the
evil, accounting that to be the more grievous, which himself more
greatly dreads, not which is in reality more greatly to be fled
from. All this fault is engendered by perversity of loving. For
being there are two lives of ours; the one eternal, which is
promised of God; the other temporal, in which we now are: when a
man shall have begun to love this temporal more than that eternal,
for the sake of this which he loveth he thinks all things right to
be done; and there are not any, in his estimation, more grievous
sins than those which do injury to this life, and either take away
from it any commodity unjustly and unlawfully, or by inflicting of
death take it utterly away. And so thieves, and robbers, and
ruffians, and torturers, and slayers, are more hated of them than
lascivious, drunken, luxurious men, if these molest no man. For
they do not understand or at all care, that these do wrong to God;
not indeed to any inconvenience of Him, but to their own pernicious
hurt; seeing they corrupt His gifts bestowed upon them, even His
temporal gifts, and by their very corruptions turn away from
eternal gifts: above all, if they have already begun to be the
Temple of God; which to all Christians the Apostle saith thus:
&#8220;Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit
of God dwelleth in you? Whoso shall corrupt God&#8217;s temple, God
will corrupt him. For the temple of God is holy: which temple are

by injurious persons, they alone sin and are hindered from eternal
life who do this, not they to whom they do it. Therefore, even if a
person consent to the taking of them from him, either that he may
not do some evil, or that he may not in these very things suffer
some greater inconvenience; not only does he not sin, but in the
one case he acts bravely and laudably, in the other usefully and
unblameably. But as to those things which are kept for the sake of
sanctity and religion, when injurious persons wish to violate
these, it is right, if the condition be proposed and the means
given, to redeem them even by sins of lesser moment, yet not by
wrongs to other men. And then do these things thenceforth cease to
be sins, which are undertaken in order to the avoidance of greater
sins. For as in things useful, for instance in pecuniary or any
other corporal commodity, that is not called a loss which is parted
with in order to a greater gain; so in things holy, that is not
called sin which is admitted lest a worse be admitted. Or if that
is called loss, which one foregoes that he may not forego more; let
this also be called sin, while however the necessity of undertaking
it in order to the eschewing of a greater is no more to be doubted,
than that, in order to avoid a greater loss, it is right to suffer
a smaller one.</p>

40. Now the things which are
to be kept safe for sanctity&#8217;s sake are these: pudicity of body,
and chastity of soul,<note place="end" n="2371" id="v.v.xli-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.xli-p2"> <i>Anim&#230;</i></p></note> and verity of doctrine. Pudicity
of body, without consent and permission of the soul, doth no man
violate. For, whatever against our will and without our empowering
the same is by greater force done upon our body, is no lewdness.
Howbeit, of permitting there may be some reason, but of consenting,
none. For we consent, when we approve and wish: but we permit even
not willing, because of some greater turpitude to be eschewed.
Consent, truly, to corporal lewdness violates also chastity of
mind. For the mind&#8217;s<note place="end" n="2372" id="v.v.xli-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.xli-p3"> <i>Animi</i></p></note> chastity consists in a good will
and sincere love, which is not corrupted, unless when we love and
desire that which Truth teaches ought not to be loved and desired.
We have therefore to guard the sincerity of love toward God and our
neighbor; for in this is chastity of mind sanctified: and we must
endeavor with all the strength in our power, and with pious
supplication, that, when the pudicity of our body is sought to be
violated, not even that outermost sense of the soul,<note place="end" n="2373" id="v.v.xli-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.xli-p4"> <i>Anim&#230;</i></p></note> which is
entangled with the flesh, may be touched with any delight; but if
it cannot this, at least the mind and thought<note place="end" n="2374" id="v.v.xli-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.xli-p5"> <i>Mentis</i></p></note> in not consenting may have its
chastity preserved entire. Now what we have to guard in chastity of
mind,<note place="end" n="2375" id="v.v.xli-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.xli-p6"> <i>Animi</i></p></note> is, as
pertaining to the love of our neighbor, innocence and benevolence;
as pertaining to the love of God, piety. Innocence is that we hurt
no man; benevolence, that we also do good to whom we can; piety,
that we worship God. But as for verity of doctrine, of religion and
piety, that is not violated unless by a lie; whereas the highest
and inmost Verity Itself, Whose that doctrine is, can in no wise be
violated: which Truth to attain unto, and in It on every wise to
remain, and to It thoroughly to cleave, will not be permitted, but
when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this
mortal shall have put on immortality. But, because all piety in
this life is practice by which we tend to that life, which practice
hath a guidance afforded unto it from that doctrine, which in human
words and signs<note place="end" n="2376" id="v.v.xli-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.xli-p7"> <i>Signaculis</i></p></note> of
corporal sacraments doth insinuate and intimate Truth herself: for
this cause this also, which by lying is possible to be corrupted,
is most of all to be kept incorrupt; that so, if aught in that
chastity of mind be violated, it may have that wherefrom it may be
repaired. For once corrupt authority of doctrine, and there can be
none either course or recourse to chastity of mind.</p>

41. There resulteth then from
all these this sentence, that a lie which doth not violate the
doctrine of piety, nor piety itself, nor innocence, nor
benevolence, may on behalf of pudicity of body be admitted. And yet
if any man should propose to himself so to love truth, not only
that which consists in contemplation, but also in uttering the true
thing, which each in its own kind of things is true, and no
otherwise to bring forth with the mouth of the body his thought
than in the mind it is conceived and beheld; so that he should
prize the beauty of truth-telling honesty, not only above gold and
silver and jewels and pleasant lands, but above this temporal life
itself altogether and every good thing of the body, I know not
whether any could wisely say that that man errs. And if he should
prefer this and prize it more than all that himself hath of such
things; rightly also would he prefer it to the temporal things of
other men, whom by his innocence and benevolence he was bound to
keep and to help. For he would love perfect faith, not only of
believing aright those things which by an excellent authority and
worthy of faith should to himself be spoken, but also of
faith<pb n="476" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_476.html" id="v.v.xlii-Page_476"/>fully uttering what himself should judge right to be
spoken, and should speak. For faith hath its name in the Latin
tongue, from that the thing is done which is said:<note place="end" n="2377" id="v.v.xlii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.xlii-p2"> &#8220;<i>Fides, quia fit quod
dicitur.</i>&#8221;</p></note> and thus
it is manifest that one doth not exhibit when telling a lie. And
even if this faith be less violated, when one lies in such sort
that he is believed to no inconvenience and no pernicious hurt,
with added intention moreover of guarding either one&#8217;s life or
corporal purity; yet violated it is, and a thing is violated which
ought to be kept safe in chastity and sanctity of mind. Whence we
are constrained, not by opinion of men, which for the most part is
in error, but by truth itself, truth which is eminent above all,
and alone is most invincible, to prefer even to purity of body,
perfect faith. For chastity of mind is, love well ordered, which
does not place the greater below the smaller. Now it is less,
whatever in the body than whatever in the mind can be violated. For
assuredly when for corporal chasteness a man tells a lie, he sees
indeed that his body is threatened with corruption, not from his
own, but from another&#8217;s lust, but is cautious lest by permitting
at least, he be a party. That permission, however, where is it but
in the mind? So then, even corporal chasteness cannot be corrupted
but in the mind; which not consenting nor permitting, it can by no
means be rightly said that corporal chasteness is violated whatever
in the body be perpetrated by another&#8217;s lust. Whence it is
gathered, that much more must the chastity of the mind be preserved
in the mind, in the which is the guardianship of the pudicity of
the body. Wherefore, what in us lies, both the one and the other
must by holy manners and conversation be walled and hedged round,
lest from another quarter it be violated. But when both cannot be,
which is to be slighted in comparison of which, who doth not see?
when he seeth which to which is to be preferred, the mind to the
body, or the body to the mind; and which is more to be shunned
among sins, the permitting of another&#8217;s deed, or the committing
of the deed thyself.</p>

42. It clearly appears then,
all being discussed, that those testimonies of Scripture have none
other meaning than that we must never at all tell a lie: seeing
that not any examples of lies, worthy of imitation, are found in
the manners and actions of the Saints, as regards those Scriptures
which are referred to no figurative signification, such as is the
history in the Acts of the Apostles. For all those sayings of our
Lord in the Gospel, which to more ignorant minds seem lies, are
figurative significations. And as to what the Apostle says: &#8220;I am
made all things to all men, that I might gain all;&#8221;<note place="end" n="2378" id="v.v.xliii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.xliii-p2"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 22" id="v.v.xliii-p2.2" parsed="|1Cor|9|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.22">1 Cor. ix. 22</scripRef></p></note> the right
understanding is, that he did this not by lying, but by sympathy;
so that he dealt with them in liberating them with so great
charity, as if he were himself in that evil from which he wished to
make them whole. There must therefore be no lying in the doctrine
of piety: it is a heinous wickedness, and the first sort of
detestable lie. There must be no lying of the second sort; because
no man must have a wrong done to him. There must be no lying of the
third sort; because we are not to consult any man&#8217;s good to the
injury of another. There must be no lying of the fourth sort, that
is, for the lust of lying, which of itself is vicious. There must
be no lying of the fifth sort, because not even the truth itself is
to be uttered with the aim of men-pleasing, how much less a lie,
which of itself, as a lie, is a foul thing? There must be no lying
of the sixth sort; for it is not right that even the truth of
testimony be corrupted for any man&#8217;s temporal convenience and
safety. But unto eternal salvation none is to be led by aid of a
lie. For not by the ill manners of them that convert him is he to
be converted to good manners: because if it is meet to be done
towards him, himself also ought when converted to do it toward
others; and so is he converted not to good, but to ill manners,
seeing that is held out to be imitated by him when converted, which
was done unto him in converting him. Neither in the seventh sort
must there be any lying; for it is meet that not any man&#8217;s
commodity or temporal welfare be preferred to the perfecting of
faith. Not even if any man is so ill moved by our right deeds as to
become worse in his mind, and far more remote from piety, are right
deeds therefore to be foregone: since what we are chiefly to hold
is that whereunto we ought to call and invite them whom as our own
selves we love; and with most courageous mind we must drink in that
apostolic sentence: &#8220;To some we are a savor of life unto life, to
others a savor of death unto death; and who is sufficient for these
things?&#8221;<note place="end" n="2379" id="v.v.xliii-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.v.xliii-p3"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. ii. 16" id="v.v.xliii-p3.2" parsed="|2Cor|2|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.16">2 Cor. ii. 16</scripRef></p></note> Nor in the
eighth sort must there be lying: because both among good things
chastity of mind is greater than pudicity of body; and among evil
things, that which ourselves do, than that which we suffer to be
done. In these eight kinds, however, a man sins less when he tells
a lie, in proportion as he emerges to the eighth: more, in
proportion as he di<pb n="477" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_477.html" id="v.v.xliii-Page_477"/>verges to the first. But whoso
shall think there is any sort of lie that is not sin, will deceive
himself foully, while he deems himself honest as a deceiver of
other men.</p>

43. So great blindness,
moreover, hath occupied men&#8217;s minds, that to them it is too
little if we pronounce some lies not to be sins; but they must
needs pronounce it to be sin in some things if we refuse to lie:
and to such a pass have they been brought by defending lying, that
even that first kind which is of all the most abominably wicked
they pronounce to have been used by the Apostle Paul. For in the
Epistle to the Galatians, written as it was, like the rest, for

1. A great deal for me to read
hast thou sent, my dearest brother Consentius: a great deal for me
to read: to the which while I am preparing an answer, and am drawn
off first by one, then by another, more urgent occupation, the year
has measured out its course, and has thrust me into such straits,
that I must answer in what sort I may, lest the time for sailing

too long detain him. Having therefore unrolled and read through all

greatly delighted with thy eloquence, and memory of the holy
Scripture, and cleverness of wit, and the resentment with which
thou bitest negligent Catholics, and the zeal with which thou
gnashest against even latent heretics. But I am not persuaded that
it is right to unearth them out of their hiding places by our
telling lies. For to what end do we take such pains in tracking
them out and running them down, but that having taken them and
brought them forth into open day, we may either teach them the
truth, or at least having convicted them by the truth, may not
allow them to hurt others? to this end, therefore, that their lie
may be blotted out, or shunned, and God&#8217;s truth increased. How
then by a lie shall I rightly be able to prosecute lies? Or is it
by robbery that robberies and by sacrilege that sacrileges, and by
adultery that adulteries, are to be prosecuted? &#8220;But if the truth
of God shall abound by my lie,&#8221; are we too to say, &#8220;Let us do

2. Perceivest thou not how
much this reasoning aideth the very persons whom as great game we
make ado to catch by our lies? For, as thyself hast shown, this is
the sentiment of the Priscillianists to prove which, they apply
testimonies from the Scriptures exhorting their followers to lie,
as though by the examples of Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles,
Angels; not hesitating to add even the Lord Christ Himself; and
deeming that they cannot otherwise prove their falsehood truthful,
unless they pronounce Truth to be a liar. It must be refuted, this;
not imitated: nor ought we to be partners with the Priscillianists
in that evil in which they are convicted to be worse than other
heretics. For they alone, or at least they in the greatest degree,
are found to make a dogma of lying for the purpose of hiding their
truth, as they call it: and this so great evil therefore to esteem
just, because they say that in the heart must be held that which is
true, but with the mouth to utter unto aliens a false thing, is no
sin; and that this is written, &#8220;Who speaketh the truth in his

this were enough for righteousness, even though a person do with
his mouth speak a lie, when not his neighbor but a stranger is he

3. Which sentence dishonoreth
the holy Martyrs, nay rather taketh away holy martyrdoms
altogether. For they would do more justly and wisely, according to
these men, not to confess to their persecutors that they were
Christians, and by confessing make them murderers: but rather by
telling a lie, and denying what they were, should both themselves
keep safe the convenience of the flesh and purpose of the heart,
and not allow those to accomplish the wickedness which they had
conceived in their mind. For they were not their neighbors in the
Christian faith, that with them it should be their duty to speak
the truth in their mouth which they spake in their heart; but
moreover enemies of Truth itself. For if Jehu (whom it seems they
do prudently to single out unto themselves to look unto as an
example of lying) falsely gave himself out for a servant of Baal,
that he might slay Baal&#8217;s servants: how much more justly,
according to their perversity, might, in time of persecution, the
servants of Christ falsely give themselves out, for servants of
demons, that the servants of demons might not slay servants of
Christ; and sacrifice to idols that men might not be killed, if
Jehu sacrificed to Baal that he might kill men? For what harm would
it do them, according to the egregious doctrine of these speakers
of lies, if they should lyingly pretend a worship of the Devil in
the body, when the worship of God was preserved in the heart? But
not so have the Martyrs understood the Apostle, the true, the holy
Martyrs. They saw and held that which is written, &#8220;With the heart

4. Of lies are many sorts,
which indeed <pb n="483" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_483.html" id="v.vi.v-Page_483"/>all, universally, we ought to
hate. For there is no lie that is not contrary to truth. For, as
light and darkness, piety and impiety, justice and iniquity, sin
and right-doing, health and weakness, life and death, so are truth
and a lie contrary the one to the other. Whence by how much we love
the former, by so much ought we to hate the latter. Yet in truth
there be some lies which to believe does no harm: although even by
such sort of lie to wish to deceive, is hurtful to him that tells
it, not to him that believes it. As though, if that brother, the
servant of God, Fronto, in the information which he gave thee,
should (though far be the thought!) say some things falsely; he
would have hurt himself assuredly, not thee, although thou, without
iniquity of thine, hadst believed all, upon his telling it.
Because, whether those things did so take place or not so, yet they
have not any thing, which if a person believe to have been so,
though it were not so, he by the rule of truth and doctrine of
eternal salvation should be judged worthy of blame. Whereas, if a
person tell a lie which if any believe he will be an heretic
against the doctrine of Christ, by so much is he who tells the lie
more hurtful, by how much he that believes it is more miserable.
See then, what manner of thing it is, if against the doctrine of
Christ we shall tell a lie which whoso believes shall perish, in
order that we may catch the enemies of the same doctrine, to the
end we may bring them to the truth, while we recede from it; nay
rather, when we catch liars by lying, teach worse lies. For it is
one thing what they say when they lie, another when they are
deceived. For, when they teach their heresy, they speak the things
in which they are deceived; but when they say that they think what
they do not think, or that they do not think what they do think,
they say the things in which they lie. In that any believeth them,
what though he do not find them out, himself perisheth not. For it
is no receding from the catholic rule, if, when a heretic lyingly
professes the catholic doctrines, one believes him to be a
catholic: and therefore it is not pernicious to him; because he is
mistaken in the mind of a man, of which, when latent, he cannot
judge, not in the faith of God which it is his duty to keep safe
planted within him. Moreover, when they teach their heresy, whoso
shall believe them, in thinking it truth, will be partaker, as of
their error, so of their damnation. So it comes to pass, that when
they fable their nefarious dogmas in which they are with deadly
error deceived, then whoso believeth them is lost: whereas when we
preach catholic dogmas, in which we hold the right faith, then if
he shall believe, that man is found, whoso was lost. But when, they
being Priscillianists, do, in order that they may not betray their
venom, lyingly give themselves out to be of us; whoever of us
believes them, even while they escape detection, himself perseveres
a Catholic: we on the other hand, if, in order to attain to the
discovery of them, we falsely give ourselves out for
Priscillianists, because we shall praise their dogmas as though
they were our own, whoso shall believe the same, will either be
confirmed among them, or will be transferred to them in the
meantime straightway: but what the coming hour may bring forth,
whether they shall be afterwards set free therefrom by us when
speaking true things, who were deceived by us when speaking false;
and whether they will be willing to hear one teaching whom they
have thus experienced telling a lie, who can know for certain? who
can be ignorant that this is uncertain? Whence it is gathered, that
it is more pernicious, or to speak more mildly, that it is more
perilous for Catholics to lie that they may catch heretics, than
for heretics to lie that they may not be found out by Catholics.
Because, whoso believes Catholics when they tell a lie to tempt
people, is either made or confirmed a heretic; but whoso believes
heretics when they tell a lie to conceal themselves, doth not cease
to be a Catholic. But that this may become more plain, let us
propose some cases by way of example, and from those writings in
preference which thou hast sent me to read.</p>

5. Well then, let us set
before our eyes a cunning spy as he makes up to the person whom he
has already perceived to be a Priscillianist; he begins with
Dictinius the bishop, and lyingly bepraises either his life, if he
knew him, or his fame, if he knew him not; this is more tolerable
thus far, because Dictinius is accounted to have been a Catholic,
and to have been corrected of that error. Then, passing on to
Priscillian, (for this comes next in the art of lying,) he shall
make reverend mention of him, of an impious and detestable person,
condemned for his nefarious wickedness and crimes! In which
reverend mention, if haply the person for whom this sort of net is
spread, had not been a firm Priscillianist, by this preaching of
him, he will be confirmed. But when the spy shall go on to
discourse of the other matters, and saying that he pities them whom
the author of darkness hath invoked in such darkness of error, that
they acknowledge not the honor of their own soul, and the
brightness of their divine ancestry: then speaking of Dictinius&#8217;s
Book, which is called &#8220;the Pound,&#8221; because it <pb n="484" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_484.html" id="v.vi.vi-Page_484"/>treats,
first and last, of a dozen questions, being as the ounces which go
to the pound, shall extol it with such praise, as to protest that
such a &#8220;Pound&#8221; (in which awful blasphemies are contained) is
more precious than many thousands of pounds of gold; truly, this
astuteness of him who tells the lie slays the soul of him who
believes it, or, that being slain already, doth in the same death
sink, and hold it down. But, thou wilt say, &#8220;afterwards it shall
be set at liberty.&#8221; What if it come not to pass, either upon
something intervening that prevents what was begun from being
completed, or through obstinacy of an heretical mind denying the
same things over again, although of some it had already begun to
make confession? especially because, if he shall find out that he
has been tampered with by a stranger, he will just the more boldy
study to conceal his sentiments by a lie, when he shall have
learned much more certainly that this is done without blame, even
by the example of the very person who tampered with him. This,
truly, in a man who thinks it right to hide the truth by telling a
lie, with what face can we blame, and dare to condemn what we
teach?</p>
</div3>

6. It remains, then, that what
the Priscillianists think, according to the nefarious falsity of
their heresy, of God, of the soul, of the body, and the rest, we
hesitate not with truthful pity to condemn; but what they think of
the right of telling a lie to hide the truth is to be to us and
them (which God forbid!) a common dogma. This is so great an evil,
that even though this attempt of ours, whereby we desire by means
of a lie to catch them and change them, should so prosper that we
do catch and change them, there is no gain that can compensate the
damage of making ourselves wrong with them in order to set them
right. For through this lie shall both we be in that respect
perverse, and they but half corrected; seeing that their thinking
it right to tell a lie on behalf of the truth is a fault which we
do not correct in them, because we have learned and do teach the
same thing, and lay it down that it is fit to be done, in order
that we may be able to attain to the amending of them. Whom yet we
amend not, for their fault, with which they think right to hide the
truth, we take not away, rather we make ourselves faulty when by
such a fault we seek them; nor do we find how we can believe them,
when converted, to whom, while perverted, we have lied; lest haply
what was done to them that they might be caught, they do to us when
caught; not only because to do it hath been their wont, but because
in us also, to whom they come, they find the same.</p>

7. And, what is more
miserable, even they, already made as it were our own, cannot find
how they may believe us. For if they suspect that even in the
catholic doctrines themselves we speak lyingly, that we may conceal
I know not what other thing which we think true; of course to one
suspecting the like thou shalt say, I did this then only to catch
thee: but what wilt thou answer when he says, Whence then do I know
whether thou art not doing it even now, lest thou be caught by me?
Or indeed, can any man be made to believe that a man does not lie
not to be caught, who lies to catch? Seest thou whither this evil
tends? that is, that not only we to them, and they to us, but every
brother to every brother shall not undeservedly become suspected?
And so while that which is aimed at by means of the lie, is that
faith may be taught, the thing which is brought about is, rather,
that there shall be no having faith in any man. For if we speak
even against God when we tell a lie, what so great evil will people
be able to discover in any lie, that, as though it were a most
wretched thing, we should be bound in every way to eschew
it?</p>

8. But now observe how more
tolerable in comparison with us is the lying of the
Priscillianists, when they know that they speak deceitfully: whom
by our own lying we think right to deliver from those false things
in which they by erring are decayed. A Priscillianist saith, that
the soul is a part of God, and of the same nature and substance
with Him. This is a great and detestable blasphemy. For it follows
that the nature of God may be taken captive, deceived, cheated,
disturbed, and defiled, condemned and tortured. But if that man
also saith this, who from so great an evil desires to deliver a man
by a lie, let us see what is the difference between the one
blasphemer and the other. &#8220;Very much,&#8221; sayest thou: &#8220;for this
the Priscillianist saith, also believing it so: but the catholic
not so believing, though so speaking.&#8221; The one, then, blasphemes
without knowing, the other with knowledge: the one against science,
the other against conscience; the one hath the blindness of
thinking false things, but in them hath at least the will of saying
true things; the other in secret seeth truth, and willingly
speaketh false. &#8220;But the one;&#8221; thou wilt say, &#8220;teacheth this,
that he may make men partakers of his error and madness: the latter
saith it that from that error and madness he may deliver men.&#8221;
Now I have already shown above how hurtful is this very
<pb n="485" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_485.html" id="v.vi.ix-Page_485"/>thing
which people believe will do good: but meanwhile if we weigh in
these two the present evils, (for the future good which a catholic
seeks from correcting a heretic is uncertain,) who sins worse? who
deceives a man without knowing it, or he who blasphemes God,
knowing it? Assuredly which is the worse, that man understands, who
with solicitous piety preferreth God to man. Add to this, that, if
God may be blasphemed in order that we may bring men to praise Him,
without doubt we do by our example and doctrine invite men not only
to praise, but also to blaspheme God: because they whom through
blasphemies against God we plot to bring to the praises of God,
verily, if we do bring them, will learn not only to praise, but
also to blaspheme. These be the benefits we confer on them whom, by
blaspheming not ignorantly but with knowledge, we deliver from
heretics! And whereas the Apostle delivered men to Satan himself
that they might learn not to blaspheme,<note place="end" n="2392" id="v.vi.ix-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi.ix-p2"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. i. 20" id="v.vi.ix-p2.2" parsed="|1Tim|1|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.1.20">1 Tim. i. 20</scripRef></p></note> we endeavor to rescue men from
Satan, that they may learn to blaspheme not with ignorance, but
with knowledge. And upon ourselves, their masters, we bring this so
great bane, that, for the sake of catching heretics, we first
become, which is certain, blasphemers of God, in order that we may
for the sake of delivering them, which is uncertain, be able to be
teachers of His truth.</p>

9. When therefore we teach
ours to blaspheme God that the Priscillianists may believe them
theirs, let us see what evil themselves say when they therefore lie
that we may believe them ours. They anathematize Priscillian, and
detest him according to our mind; they say that the soul is a
creature of God, not a part; they execrate the Priscillianists&#8217;
false martyrdoms; the catholic bishops by whom that heresy has been
stripped, attacked, prostrated, they extol with great praises, and
so forth. Behold, themselves speak truth when they lie: not that
the very thing which is a lie can be true at the same time; but
when in one thing they lie, in another they speak truth: for when,
in saying they are of us, they lie, of the catholic faith they
speak truth. And therefore they, that they may not be found out for
Priscillianists, speak in lying manner the truth: but we, that we
may find them out, not only speak lyingly, that we may be believed
to belong to them; but we also speak false things which we know to
belong to their error. Therefore as for them, when they wish to be
thought of us, it is both false in part, and true in part, what
they say; for it is false that they are of us, but true that the
soul is not a part of God: but as for us, when we wish to be
thought to belong to them, it is false, both the one and the other
that we say, both that we are Priscillianists, and that the soul is
a part of God. They, then, praise God, not blaspheme, when they
conceal themselves; and when they do not so, but utter their own
sentiments, they know not that they blaspheme. So that if they be
converted to the catholic faith, they console themselves, because
they can say what the Apostle said: who when among other things he
had said, &#8220;I was before a blasphemer; but,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;I
obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2393" id="v.vi.x-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi.x-p2"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. i. 13" id="v.vi.x-p2.2" parsed="|1Tim|1|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.1.13">1 Tim. i. 13</scripRef></p></note> We on the contrary, in order that
they may open themselves to us, if we utter this as if it were a
just lie for deceiving and catching them, do assuredly both say
that we belong to the blaspheming Priscillianists, and that they
may believe us, do without excuse of ignorance blaspheme. For a
catholic, who by blaspheming wishes to be thought a heretic, cannot
say, &#8220;I did it ignorantly.&#8221;</p>

what he speaketh, himself believe not; as the heretics, and, above
all, these same Priscillianists do, when they do, not indeed
believe the catholic faith, but yet speak it, that they may be
believed to be of us. They speak therefore the truth in their
mouth, not in their heart. On this account were they to be
distinguished from him of whom it is written, &#8220;He that speaketh

salvation. For also in that psalm, after it had been said, &#8220;Who

the Apostles&#8217; times some who preached the truth not in truth,
that is, not with truthful mind: of whom the Apostle saith that
they preached Christ not chastely, but of envy and strife. And on
this account even at that time some were tolerated while preaching
truth not with a chaste mind: yet not any have been praised as

17. Wherefore, though there
be indeed many ways in which latent heretics may be sought out,
without vituperating the catholic faith or praising heretical
impiety, yet if there were no other way at all of drawing out
heretical impiety from its caverns, but that the catholic tongue
should deviate from the straight path of truth; more tolerable were
it that that should be hid, than that this should be precipitated;
more tolerable that the foxes should lurk in their pits unseen,
than for the sake of catching them the huntsmen should fall into
the pit of blasphemy; more tolerable that the perfidy of
Priscillianists should be covered with the veil of truth, than that
the faith of catholics, lest it should of lying Priscillianists be
praised, should of believing catholics be denied. For if lies, not
of whatsoever kind, but blasphemous lies, are therefore just
because they are committed with intent to detect hidden heretics;
it will be possible at that rate, if they be commuted with the same
intention, that there should be chaste adulteries. For put the case
that of a number of lewd Priscillianists, some woman should cast
her eye upon a catholic Joseph, and promise him that she will
betray their hidden retreats if she obtain from him that he lie
with her, and it be certain that if he consent unto her she will
make good her promise: shall we judge that it ought to be done? Or
shall we understand that by no means must such a price be paid in
purchase of that kind of merchandise? Why then do we not rout out
heretics, in order to their being caught, by the flesh committing
lasciviousness in adultery, and yet think right to rout them out by
a mouth committing fornication in blasphemy? For either it will be
lawful to defend both the one and the other with equal reason, that
these things be therefore said to be not unjust, because they were
done with intention of finding out the unjust: or if sound doctrine
willeth not even for the sake of finding out heretics that we
should have to do with unchaste women, albeit only in body, not in
mind, assuredly not even for the sake of finding out heretics
willeth it that by us, albeit only in voice not in mind, either
unclean heresy were preached, or the chaste Catholic Church
blasphemed. Because even the very sovereignty of the mind, to which
every inferior motion of the man ought to be obedient, will not
lack deserved opprobrium, when a thing is done that ought not to be
done, whether by member or by word. Although even when it is done
by word, it is done by member: because the tongue is a member, by
which the word is made; nor is any deed of ours by any member
brought to the birth unless it is first conceived in the heart; or
rather being by our inwardly thinking upon and consenting unto it
already brought to the birth, it is brought forth abroad in our
doing of it, by a member. It is therefore no excusing the mind from
the deed, when any thing is said to be done not after the purpose
of the mind,<note place="end" n="2405" id="v.vi.xviii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi.xviii-p2"> <i>Ex animo</i></p></note> which yet
were not done, unless the mind decreed it to be done.</p>

18. It does indeed make very
much difference, for what cause, with what end, with what intention
a thing be done: but those things which are clearly sins, are upon
no plea of a good cause, with no seeming good end, no alleged good
intention, to be done. Those works, namely of men, which are not in
themselves sins, are now good, now evil, according as their causes
are good or evil; as, to give food to a poor man is a good work, if
it be done because of pity, with right faith; as to lie with a
wife, when it is done for the <pb n="488" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_488.html" id="v.vi.xix-Page_488"/>sake of generation, if it be
done with faith to beget subjects for regeneration. These and the
like works according to their causes are good or evil, because the
self-same, if they have evil causes, are turned into sins: as, if
for boasting sake a poor man is fed; or for lasciviousness a man
lies with his wife; or children are begotten, not that they may be
nurtured for God, but for the devil. When, however, the works in
themselves are evil, such as thefts, fornications, blasphemies, or
other such; who is there that will say, that upon good causes they
may be done, so as either to be no sins, or, what is more absurd,
just sins? Who is there that would say, That we may have to give to
the poor, let us commit thefts upon the rich: or, Let us sell false
witness, especially if innocent men are not hurt thereby, but
rather guilty men are rescued from the judges who would condemn
them? For two good things are done by selling of this lie, that
money may be taken wherewith a poor man may be fed, and a judge
deceived that a man be not punished. Even in the matter of wills,
if we can, why not suppress the true, and forge false wills that
inheritances or legacies may not come to unworthy persons, who do
no good with them; but rather to those by whom the hungry are fed,
the naked clothed, strangers entertained, captives redeemed,
Churches builded? For why should not those evil things be done for
the sake of these good things, if, for the sake of these good
things, those are not evil at all? Nay, further, if lewd and rich
women are likely to enrich moreover their lovers and paramours, why
should not even these parts and arts be undertaken by a man of
merciful heart, to use them for so good a cause as that he may have
whence to bestow upon the needy; and not hear the Apostle saying,
&#8220;Let him that stole steal no more, but rather let him labor,
working with his hands that which is good, that he may have to give
to him that needeth?&#8221;<note place="end" n="2406" id="v.vi.xix-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi.xix-p2"> <scripRef passage="Eph. iv. 28" id="v.vi.xix-p2.2" parsed="|Eph|4|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.4.28">Eph. iv. 28</scripRef></p></note> If indeed not only theft itself,
but also false witness and adultery and every evil work will be not
evil but good, if it be done for the sake of being the means of
doing good. Who can say these things, except one who endeavors to
subvert human affairs and all manners and laws? For of what most
heinous deed, what most foul crime, what most impious sacrilege,
may it not be said that it is possible for it to be done rightly
and justly; and not only with impunity, but even gloriously, that
in perpetrating thereof not only no punishments should be feared,
but there should be hope even of rewards: if once we shall concede
in all evil works of men, that not what is done, but wherefore
done, must be the question; and this, to the end that whatever are
found to have been done for good causes, not even they should be
judged to be evil? But if justice deservedly punisheth a thief,
albeit he shall say and shew that he therefore withdrew
superfluities from a rich that he might afford necessaries to a
poor man; if deservedly she punisheth a forger, albeit he prove
that he therefore corrupted another&#8217;s will, that he might be
heir, who should thence make large alms, not he who should make
none; if deservedly she punisheth an adulterer yea, though he shall
demonstrate that of mercy he did commit adultery, that through her
with whom he did it he might deliver a man from death; lastly, to
draw nearer to the matter in question, if deservedly she punishment
him who hath with that intent mixed in adulterous embrace with some
woman, privy to the turpitude of the Priscillianists, that he might
enter into their concealments; I pray thee, when the Apostle saith,

therefore neither hands, nor members of generation, nor other
members, can it be right to yield unto flagitious deeds with intent

tongue, what our whole mouth, what the organ of the voice, offended
us, that we should yield these as instruments to sin, and to so
great a sin, in which, that we may apprehend and rescue
Priscillianists from blaspheming in ignorance, we, without excuse
of ignorance, are to blaspheme our God?</p>

19. Some man will say, &#8220;So
then any thief whatever is to be accounted equal with that thief
who steals with will of mercy?&#8221; Who would say this? But of these
two it does not follow that any is good, because one is worse. He
is worse who steals through coveting, than he who steals through
pity: but if all theft be sin, from all theft we must abstain. For
who can say that people may sin, even though one sin be damnable,
another venial? but now we are asking, if a man shall do this or
that, who will not sin or will sin? not, who will sin more heavily
or lightly. For even thefts themselves are more lightly punished by
law than crimes of lust: they are, however, both sins, albeit the
one lighter, the other heavier; so that a theft which is committed
of concupiescence is held to be lighter than an act of lust which
is committed for <pb n="489" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_489.html" id="v.vi.xx-Page_489"/>doing a good turn. Namely, in
their own kind these become lighter than other sins of the same
kind, which appear to be committed with a good intention; when yet
the same compared with sins of another kind lighter in respect of
the kind itself, are found to be heavier. It is a heavier sin to
commit theft of avarice than of mercy; and likewise it is a heavier
sin to perpetrate lewdness of luxury, than of mercy; and yet is it
a heavier sin to commit adultery of mercy, than to commit theft of
avarice. Nor is it our concern now, what is lighter or what
heavier, but what are sins or are not. For no man can say that it
was a duty for a sin to be done, where it is clearly a sin; but we
say that it is a duty, if the sin were done so or so, to forgive or
not to forgive.</p>

20. But, what must be
confessed, to human minds certain compensative sins do cause such
embarrassment, that they are even thought meet to be praised, and
rather to be called right deeds. For who can doubt it to be a great
sin, if a father prostitute his own daughters to the fornications
of the impious? And yet hath there arisen a case in which a just
man thought it his duty to do this, when the Sodomites with
nefarious onset of lust were rushing upon his guests. For he said,
&#8220;I have two daughters which have not known man; I will bring them
out to you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto
these men do ye no wrong, for that they have come under covering of
my roof.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2408" id="v.vi.xxi-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi.xxi-p2"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xix. 8" id="v.vi.xxi-p2.2" parsed="|Gen|19|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.19.8">Gen. xix. 8</scripRef></p></note> What shall
we say here? Do we not so abhor the wickedness which the Sodomites
were attempting to do to the guests of the just man, that, whatever
were done so this were not done, he should deem right to be done?
Very much also moveth us the person of the doer, which by merit of
righteousness was obtaining deliverance from Sodom, to say that,
since it is a less evil for women to suffer lewdness than for men,
it even pertained to the righteousness of that just man, that to
his daughters he chose this rather to be done, than to his guests;
not only willing this in his mind, but also offering it in word,
and, if they should assent, ready to fulfill it in deed. But then,
if we shall open this way to sins, that we are to commit less sins,
in order that others may not commit greater; by a broad boundary,
nay rather, with no boundary at all, but with a tearing up and
removing of all bounds, in infinite space, will all sins enter in
and reign. For, when it shall be defined, that a man is to sin
less, that another may not sin more; then, of course, by our
committing thefts shall other men&#8217;s committing of lewdness be
guarded against, and incest by lewdness; and if any impiety shall
seem even worse than incest, even incest shall be pronounced meet
to be done by us, if in such wise it can be wrought that that
impiety be not committed by others: and in each several kind of
sins, both thefts for thefts, and lewdness for lewdness, and incest
for incest, shall be accounted meet to be done: our own sins for
other men&#8217;s, not only less for greater, but even if it come to
the very highest and worst, fewer for more; if the stress of
affairs so turns, that otherwise other men would not abstain from
sin unless by our sinning, somewhat less indeed, but still sinning;
so that in every case where an enemy who shall have power of this
sort shall say, &#8220;Unless thou be wicked, I will be more wicked, or
unless thou do this wickedness, I will do more such,&#8221; we must
seem to admit wickedness in ourselves, if we wish to refrain
(others) from wickedness. To be wise in this sort, what is it but
to lose one&#8217;s wits, or rather, to be downright mad? Mine own
iniquity, not another&#8217;s, whether perpetrated upon me or upon
others, is that from which I must beware of damnation. For &#8220;the
soul that sinneth, it shall die.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2409" id="v.vi.xxi-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi.xxi-p3"> <scripRef passage="Ezek. xviii. 4" id="v.vi.xxi-p3.2" parsed="|Ezek|18|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.18.4">Ezek. xviii. 4</scripRef></p></note></p>

21. If then to sin, that
others may not commit a worse sin, either against us or against
any, without doubt we ought not; it is to be considered in that
which Lot did, whether it be an example which we ought to imitate,
or rather one which we ought to avoid. For it seems meet to be more
looked into and noted, that, when so horrible an evil from the most
flagitious impiety of the Sodomites was impending over his guests,
which he wished to ward off and was not able, to such a degree may
even that just man&#8217;s mind have been disturbed, that he was
willing to do that which, not man&#8217;s fear with its misty temper,
but God&#8217;s Law in its tranquil serenity, if it be consulted by us,
will cry aloud, must not be done, and will command rather that we
be so cautious not to sin ourselves, that we sin not through fear
of any sins whatever of other men. For that just man, by fearing
other men&#8217;s sins, which cannot defile except such as consent
thereto, was so perturbed that he did not attend to his own sin, in
that he was willing to subject his daughters to the lusts of
impious men. These things, when we read in holy Scriptures, we must
not, for that we believe them done, therefore believe them meet to
be done; lest we violate precepts while we indis<pb n="490" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_490.html" id="v.vi.xxii-Page_490"/>criminately
follow precedents. Or, truly, because David swore to put Nabal to

therefore say that he is to be imitated, so that we may swear to do
a thing which afterwards we may see to be not meet to be done? But
as fear perturbed the one, so that he was willing to prostitute his
daughters, so did anger the other, that he swore rashly. In short,
if it were allowed us to inquire of them both, by asking them to
tell us why they did these things, the one might answer,

22. And to holy David indeed
it might more justly be said, that he ought not to have been angry;
no, not with one however ungrateful and rendering evil for good;
yet if, as man, anger did steal over him, he ought not to have let
it so prevail, that he should swear to do a thing which either by
giving way to his rage he should do, or by breaking his oath leave
undone. But to the other, set as he was amid the libidinous frenzy
of the Sodomites, who would dare to say, &#8220;Although thy guests in
thine own house, whither to enter in thou by most violent humanity
hast compelled them, be laid hold upon by lewd men, and being
deforced be carnally known as women, fear thou not a whit, care for
it not a whir, have no dread, no horror, no trembling?&#8221; What man,
even a companion of those wretches, would dare to say this to the
pious host? But assuredly it would be most rightly said, &#8220;Do what
thou canst, that the thing be not done which thou deservedly
fearest: but let not this fear of thine drive thee to do a thing
which if thy daughters be willing that it be done unto them, they
will through thee do wickedness with the Sodomites, if unwilling,
will through thee from the Sodomites suffer violence. Commit not
thou a great crime of thine own, while thou dreadest a greater
crime of other men; for be the difference as great as thou wilt
between thine own and that of others, this will be thine own, that
other men&#8217;s.&#8221; Unless perchance in defending this man one should
so crowd himself into a corner, as to say, &#8220;Since to receive a
wrong is better than to do one, and those guests were not about to
do but to suffer a wrong, that just man chose that his daughters
should suffer wrong rather than his guests, acting upon his rights
as his daughters&#8217; lord; and he knew that it would be no sin in
them if the thing were done, because they would but bear them which
did the sin, not consenting unto them, and so without sin of their
own. In fine, they did not offer themselves (albeit better females
than males) to be carnally known instead of those guests, lest they
should be rendered guilty, not by the suffering of others&#8217; lust,
but by consenting of their own will: nor yet did their father
permit it to be done unto himself, when they essayed to do it,
because he would not betray his guests to them, (albeit there had
been less of evil, if it were done to one man than to two;) but as
much as he could he resisted, lest himself also should be defiled
by any assent of his own, though even if the frenzy of others&#8217;
lust had prevailed by strength of body, it would not have defiled
him so long as he consented not. Now as the daughters sinned not,
neither did he sin in their persons, because he was not making them
to sin, if they should be deforced against their will, but only to
bear them that did the sin. Just as if he should offer his slaves
to be beaten by ruffians, that his guests might not suffer the
wrong of beating.&#8221; Of which matter I shall not dispute, because
it would take long to argue, whether even a master may justly use
his right of power over his slave, so as to cause an unoffending
slave to be smitten, that his unoffending friend may not be beaten
in his house by violent bad men. But certainly, as concerning
David, it is no wise right to say that he ought to have sworn to do
a thing which afterwards he would perceive that he ought not to do.
Whence it is clear that we ought not to take all that we read to
have been done by holy or just men, and transfer the same to
morals, but hence too we must learn how widely that saying of the
Apostle extends, and even to what persons it reaches: &#8220;Brethren,

23. But in all our doings,
even good men are very greatly embarrassed in the matter
<pb n="491" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_491.html" id="v.vi.xxiv-Page_491"/>of
compensative sins; so that these are not esteemed to be sins, if
they have such causes for the which they be done, and in the which
it may seem to be rather sin, if they be left undone. And chiefly
as concerning lies hath it come to this pass in the opinion of men
that those lies are not accounted sins, nay rather are believed to
be rightly done, when one tells a lie for the benefit of him for
whom it is expedient to be deceived, or lest a person should hurt
others, who seems likely to hurt unless he be got rid of by lies.
In defense of these kinds of lies, very many examples from holy
Scripture are accounted to lend their support. It is not, however,
the same thing to hide the truth as it is to utter a lie. For
although every one who lies wishes to hide what is true, yet not
every one who wishes to hide what is true, tells a lie. For in
general we hide truths not by telling a lie, but by holding our
peace. For the Lord lied not when He said, &#8220;I have many things to
say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2414" id="v.vi.xxiv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi.xxiv-p2"> <scripRef passage="John xvi. 12" id="v.vi.xxiv-p2.2" parsed="|John|16|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.16.12">John xvi. 12</scripRef></p></note> He held His peace from true
things, not spoke false things; for the hearing of which truths He
judged them to be less fit. But if He had not indicated this same
to them, that is, that they were not able to bear the things which
He was unwilling to speak, He would indeed hide nevertheless
somewhat of truth but that this may be rightly done we should
peradventure not know, or not have so great an example to confirm
us. Whence, they who assert that it is sometimes meet to lie, do
not conveniently mention that Abraham did this concerning Sarah,
whom he said to be his sister. For he did not say, She is not my
wife, but he said, &#8220;She is my sister;&#8221;<note place="end" n="2415" id="v.vi.xxiv-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi.xxiv-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xx. 2, 12" id="v.vi.xxiv-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|20|2|0|0;|Gen|20|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.20.2 Bible:Gen.20.12">Gen. xx. 2, 12</scripRef></p></note> because she was in truth so near
akin, that she might without a lie be called a sister. Which also

kindred, not the mother&#8217;s. Somewhat therefore of truth he left
untold, not told aught of falsehood, when he left wife untold, and
told of sister. This also did his son Isaac: for him too we know to
have gotten a wife near of kin.<note place="end" n="2416" id="v.vi.xxiv-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi.xxiv-p4"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xxvi. 7" id="v.vi.xxiv-p4.2" parsed="|Gen|26|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.26.7">Gen. xxvi. 7</scripRef>, and xxiv</p></note> It is not then a lie, when by

24. Touching Jacob, however,
that which he did at his mother&#8217;s bidding, so as to seem to
deceive his father, if with diligence and in faith it be attended
to, is no lie, but a mystery. The which if we shall call lies, all
parables also, and figures designed for the signifying of any
things soever, which are not to be taken according to their proper
meaning, but in them is one thing to be understood from another,
shall be said to be lies: which be far from us altogether. For he
who thinks this, may also in regard of tropical expressions of
which there are so many, bring in upon all of them this calumny; so
that even metaphor, as it is called, that is, the usurped
transferring of any word from its proper object to an object not
proper, may at this rate be called a lie. For when he speaks of

prophetical speeches and actions, to be referred to the
understanding of those things which are true; which are covered as
it were with a garb of figure on purpose to exercise the sense of
the pious inquirer, and that they may not become cheap by lying
bare and on the surface. Though even the things which we have
learned from other places, where they are spoken openly and
manifestly, these, when they are brought out from their hidden
retreats, do, by our (in some sort) discovering of them, become
re<pb n="492" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_492.html" id="v.vi.xxv-Page_492"/>newed , and by renewal sweet. Nor is it that they are
begrudged to the learners, in that they are in these ways obscured;
but are presented in a more winning manner, that being as it were
withdrawn, they may be desired more ardently, and being desired may
with more pleasure be found. Yet true things, not false, are
spoken; because true things, not false, are signified, whether by
word or by deed; the things that are signified namely, those are
the things spoken. They are accounted lies only because people do
not understand that the true things which are signified are the
things said, but believe that false things are the things said. To
make this plainer by examples, attend to this very thing that Jacob
did. With skins of the kids, no doubt, he did cover his limbs; if
we seek the immediate cause, we shall account him to have lied; for
he did this, that he might be thought to be the man he was not: but
if this deed be referred to that for the signifying of which it was
really done, by skins of the kids are signified sins; by him who
covered himself therewith, He who bare not His own, but others&#8217;
sins. The truthful signification, therefore, can in no wise be
rightly called a lie. And as in deed, so also in word. Namely, when
his father said to him, &#8220;Who art thou my son?&#8221;<note place="end" n="2423" id="v.vi.xxv-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi.xxv-p8"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xxvii. 16-19" id="v.vi.xxv-p8.2" parsed="|Gen|27|16|27|19" osisRef="Bible:Gen.27.16-Gen.27.19">Gen. xxvii.

answered, &#8220;I am Esau, thy first-born.&#8221; This, if it be referred
to those two twins, will seem a lie; but if to that for the
signifying of which those deeds and words are written, He is here
to be understood, in His body, which is His Church, Who, speaking
of this thing, saith, &#8220;When ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and
Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves
cast out. And they shall come from the east and from the west and
from the north and from the south, and shall sit down in the

younger brother did bear off the primacy of the elder brother, and

which are signified are not in truth things which are not, but
which are, whether past or present or future, without doubt it is a
true signification, and no lie. But it takes too long in the matter

25. Nor have I undertaken
that in the present discourse, as it more pertains to thee, who
hast laid open the hiding-places of the Priscillianists, so far as
relates to their false and perverse dogmas; that they may not seem
to have been in such sort investigated as if they were meet to be
taught, not to be argued against. Make it therefore more thy work
that they be beaten down and laid low, as thou hast made it, that
they should be betrayed and laid open; lest while we wish to get at
the discovery of men practising falsehood, we allow the falsehoods
themselves, as if insuperable, to stand their ground; when we ought
rather even in the hearts of latent heretics to destroy falsehoods,
than by sparing falsehoods to find out the deceivers who practise
falsehood. Moreover, among those dogmas of theirs which are to be
subverted, is this which they dogmatize, namely, that in order to
hide religion religious people ought to lie, to that degree that
not only concerning other matters, not pertaining to doctrine of
religion, but concerning religion itself, it is meet to lie, that
it may not become exposed to aliens; to wit, that one may deny
Christ, in order that one may in the midst of His enemies be in
secret a Christian. This impious and nefarious dogma do thou
likewise, I beseech thee, overthrow; to bolster up which they in
their argumentations do gather from the Scriptures testimonies to
make it appear that lies are not only to be pardoned and tolerated,
but even honored. To thee therefore it pertains, in refuting that
detestable sect, to show that those testimonies of Scripture are so
to be received, that either thou shalt teach those to be no lies
which are accounted to be such, if they be understood in that
manner in which they ought to be understood; or, that those are not
to be imitated which be manifestly lies; or in any wise at last,
that concerning those matters at least which pertain to doctrine of
religion, it is in no wise meet to tell a lie. For thus are they
truly from the very foundation overthrown, while that is overthrown
wherein they lurk: that in that very matter they be judged least
fit for us to follow, most fit to be shunned, in that they, for the
hiding of their heresy, do profess themselves liars. This it is in
them that must from the very first be assaulted, this which is, as
it were, their fitting bulwark must with blows of Truth be battered
and cast down. Nor must we afford them another lurking-place, which
they had not, wherein they may take refuge, to wit, that being
perhaps betrayed of them whom they have es<pb n="493" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_493.html" id="v.vi.xxvi-Page_493"/>sayed to
seduce but could not, they should say, &#8220;We only wanted to try
them, because prudent Catholics have taught that to find out
heretics it is right to do this.&#8221; But it is necessary with
somewhat more earnest be-speaking of thy favor to say why this
seems to me a tripartite method of disputing against those who want
to apply the divine Scriptures as advocates of their lies; to wit,
by showing that some which are there accounted to be lies, are not
what they are accounted, if rightly understood; next, that if there
be there any manifest lies, they are not meet to be imitated;
thirdly, contrary to all opinions of all persons who think it
pertains to the duty of a good man sometimes to lie, that it must
in every way be held that in doctrine of religion there must in no
wise a lie be told. For these are the three things to follow up
which I shortly before recommended, and in some sort enjoined
thee.</p>

26. To show then that some
things in the Scriptures which are thought to be lies are not what
they are thought, if they be rightly understood, let it not seem to
thee to tell little against them, that it is not from Apostolic but
from Prophetical books that they find as it were precedents of
lying. For all those which they mention by name, in which each
lied, are read in those books in which not only words but many
deeds of a figurative meaning are recorded, because it was also in
a figurative sense that they were done. But in figures that which
is spoken as a seeming lie, being well understood, is found to be a
truth. The Apostles, however, in their Epistles spoke in another
sort, and in another sort are written the Acts of the Apostles, to
wit, because now the New Testament was revealed, which was veiled
in those prophetic figures. In short, in all those Apostolic
Epistles, and in that large book in which their acts are narrated
with canonical truth, we do not find any person lying, such that
from him a precedent can be set forth by these men for license of
lying. For that simulation of Peter and Barnabas with which they
were compelling the Gentiles to Judaize, was deservedly reprehended
and set right, both that it might not do harm at the time, and that
it might not weigh with posterity as a thing to be imitated. For
when the Apostle Paul saw that they walked not uprightly according
to the truth of the Gospel, he said to Peter in the presence of
them all, &#8220;If thou, being a Jew, livest as the Gentiles; and not
as do the Jews, how compellest thou the Gentiles to Judaize?&#8221;<note place="end" n="2426" id="v.vi.xxvii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi.xxvii-p2"> <scripRef passage="Gal. ii. 13, 14" id="v.vi.xxvii-p2.2" parsed="|Gal|2|13|2|14" osisRef="Bible:Gal.2.13-Gal.2.14">Gal. ii. 13, 14</scripRef></p></note> But in
that which himself did, to the intent that by retaining and acting
upon certain observances of the law after the Jewish custom he
might show that he was no enemy to the Law and to the Prophets, far
be it from us to believe that he did so as a liar. As indeed
concerning this matter his sentence is sufficiently well known,
whereby it was settled that neither Jews who then believed in
Christ were to be prohibited from the traditions of their fathers,
nor Gentiles when they became Christians to be compelled thereunto:
in order that those sacred rites<note place="end" n="2427" id="v.vi.xxvii-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi.xxvii-p3"> 
&#8220;<i>Sacramenta.</i>&#8221;</p></note> which were well known to have been
of God enjoined, should not be shunned as sacrileges; nor yet
accounted so necessary, now that the New Testament was revealed, as
though without them whoso should be converted unto God, could not
be saved. For there were some who thought so and preached, albeit
after Christ&#8217;s Gospel received; and to these had feignedly
consented both Peter and Barnabas, and so were compelling the
Gentiles to Judaize. For it was a compelling, to preach them to be
so necessary as if, even after the Gospel received, without them
were no salvation in Christ. This the error of certain did suppose,
this Peter&#8217;s fear did feign, this Paul&#8217;s liberty did beat down.
What therefore he saith, &#8220;I am made all things to all, that I
might gain all,&#8221;<note place="end" n="2428" id="v.vi.xxvii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi.xxvii-p4"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 22" id="v.vi.xxvii-p4.2" parsed="|1Cor|9|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.22">1 Cor. ix. 22</scripRef>. [See

others, not by lying. For each becomes as though he were that
person whom he would fain succor, when he succoreth with the same
pity wherewith he would wish himself to be succored, if himself
were set in the same misery. Therefore he becomes as though he were
that person, not for that he deceives him, but for that he thinks
himself as him. Whence is that of the Apostle, which I have before
rehearsed, &#8220;Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which
are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness,
considering thyself lest thou also be tempted.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2429" id="v.vi.xxvii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi.xxvii-p5"> <scripRef passage="Gal. vi. 1" id="v.vi.xxvii-p5.2" parsed="|Gal|6|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.6.1">Gal. vi. 1</scripRef></p></note> For if,

have in a lying manner taken up the sacraments of the old law, he
ought in the same manner to have taken up, in a lying way, the
idolatry of the Gentiles, because he hath said that to them which
were without law he became as without law; which thing in any wise
he did not. For he did not any where sacrifice to idols or adore
those figments and not rather freely as a martyr of Christ show
that they were to be detested and eschewed. From no apostolic acts
or speeches, there<pb n="494" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_494.html" id="v.vi.xxvii-Page_494"/>fore, do these men allege
things meet for imitation as examples of lying. From prophetical
deeds or words, then, the reason why they seem to themselves to
have what they may allege, is only for that they take figures
prenunciative to be lies, because they are sometimes like unto
lies. But when they are referred to those things for the signifying
of which they were so done or said, they are found to be
significations full of truth, and therefore in no wise to be lies.
A lie, namely, is a false signification with will of deceiving. But
that is no false signification, where, although one thing is
signified by another, yet the thing signified is a true thing, if
it be rightly understood.</p>

no other thing that Jesus signified, in that He feigned to be going

to be going further:&#8221; lest any from this word, like the
Priscillianists, wishing to have license of lying, should contend
that beside others even Christ did lie. But whoso would understand
what He by feigning that did prefigure, let him attend to that
which He by acting did effect. For when afterwards He did go
further, above all heavens, yet deserted He not His disciples. In
order to signify this which in the future He did as God, at the
present He feigned to do that as Man. And therefore was a veritable
signification caused in that feigning to go before, because in this
departure the verity of that signification did follow after. Let
him therefore contend that Christ did lie by feigning, who denieth
that He fulfilled by doing that which He signified.</p>

sometimes called sins. These doubtless can be understood to be just
sins, when just sacrifices are spoken of, or just punishments. But
those things which are done against God&#8217;s law cannot be just. It

understand as concerning those women, whether in Egypt or in
Jericho, that for their humanity and mercy they received a reward,
in any wise temporal, which indeed itself, while they wist not of
it, should by prophetical signification prefigure somewhat eternal.
But whether it be ever right, even for the saving of a man&#8217;s

the most learned do weary themselves, it did vastly surpass the
capacity of those poor women, set in the midst of those nations,
and accustomed to those manners. Therefore their ignorance in this
as well as in those other things of which they were alike
unknowing, but which are to be known by the children not of this
world but of that which is to come, the patience of God did bear
withal: Who yet, for their human kindness which they had shown to
His servants, rendered unto them rewards of an earthly sort, albeit
signifying somewhat of an heavenly. And Rahab, indeed, delivered
out of Jericho, made transition into the people of God, where,
being proficient, she might attain to eternal and immortal prizes
which are not to be sought by any lie. Yet at that time when she
did for the Israelite spies that good, and, for her condition of

search the house. But did it follow that they would also find them,

that most cautious woman had placed them where they would have been
able to remain undiscovered if she, telling a lie, should not be
believed. So both she, if after all she had been slain by her
countrymen for the work of mercy, would have ended this life, which

&#8220;What if the men who sought them, in their thorough-going search
had come to the place where she had concealed them?&#8221; In this
fashion it may be said: What if a most vile and base woman, not
only telling, but swearing a lie, had not got them to believe her?
Of course even so would the things have been like to come to pass,
through fear of which she lied. And where do we put the will and
power of God? or haply was He not able to keep both her, neither
telling a lie to her own townsmen, nor betraying men of God, and
them, being His, safe from all harm? For by Whom also after the
woman&#8217;s lie they were guarded, by Him could they, even if she had
not lied, have in any wise been guarded. Unless perchance we have
forgotten that this did come to pass in Sodom, where males burning
towards males with hideous lust could not so much as find the door
of the house in which were the men they sought; when that just man,
in a case altogether most similar, would not tell a lie for his
guests, whom he knew not to be Angels, and feared lest they should
suffer a violence worse than death. And doubtless, he might have
given the seekers the like answer as that woman gave in Jericho.
For it was in precisely the like manner that they sought by
interrogating. But that just person was not willing that for the
bodies of his guests his soul should be spotted by his own telling

left him which he may not rightly do. Therefore, touching Rahab in
Jericho, because she entertained strangers, men of God, because in
entertaining of them she put herself in peril, because she believed
on their God, because she diligently hid them where she could,
because she gave them most faithful counsel of returning by another
way, let her be praised as meet to be imitated even by the citizens
of Jerusalem on high. But in that she lied, although somewhat
therein as prophetical be intelligently expounded, yet not as meet
to be imitated is it wisely propounded: albeit that God hath those
good things memorably honored, this evil thing mercifully
overlooked.</p>

36. But for that we are men
and among men do live, and I confess that I am not yet in the
number of them whom compensative sins embarrass not, it oft
befalleth me in human affairs to be overcome by human feeling, nor
am I able to resist when it is said to me, &#8220;Lo, here is a sick
man in peril of his life with a grievous disease, whose strength
will no more be able to bear it, if the death of his only and most
dear son be announced to him; he asks of thee whether his son
liveth, and thou knowest that he is departed this <pb n="498" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_498.html" id="v.vi.xxxvii-Page_498"/>life; what
wilt thou reply, when, whatever thou shall say beside one of these
three; either, He is dead; or, He liveth; or, I know not; he
believes no other than that he is dead; which thing he perceives
thee to be afraid to tell, and unwilling to tell a lie?&#8221; It comes
to the same thing, if thou altogether hold thy peace. But of those
three, two are false, He liveth, and, I know not; and they cannot
be said by thee but by telling a lie. Whereas if thou shall say
that one thing which is true, that is, that he is dead, and the man
be so perturbed that death follow, people will cry out that thou
hast killed him. And who can bear men casting up to him what a
mischief it is to shun a lie that might save life, and to choose
truth which murders a man? I am moved by these objections
exceedingly, but it were marvelous whether also wisely. For, when I
shall set before the eyes of my heart (such as they be) the
intellectual<note place="end" n="2459" id="v.vi.xxxvii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi.xxxvii-p2"> <i>Intelligibilem</i></p></note> beauty of
Him out of Whose mouth nothing false proceedeth, albeit where truth
in her radiance doth more and more brighten upon me, there my weak
and throbbing sense is beaten back: yet I am with love of that
surpassing comeliness so set on fire, that I despise all human
regards which would thence recall me. But it is much that this
affection persevere to that degree, that in temptation it lack not
its effect. Nor doth it move me while contemplating that luminous
Good in which is no darkness of a lie, that, when we refuse to lie,
and men through hearing of a truth do die, truth is called a
murderer. For if a lewd woman crave of thee the gratification of
her lust, and, when thou consentest not, she perturbed with the
fierceness of her love should die, will chastity also be a
murderer? Or, truly, because we read, &#8220;We are a sweet savor of

a duty, to commit perjury! O, where are ye, fountains of tears? And

be false which he teaches, who would care to give heed to false
doctrine, in which both he deceives that teaches and he is deceived

38. But infirmity pleadeth
its part, and with favor of the crowds proclaims itself to have a
cause invincible. Where it contradicts, and says, &#8220;What way is
there among men, who without doubt by being deceived <pb n="499" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_499.html" id="v.vi.xxxix-Page_499"/>are turned
aside from a deadly harm to others or themselves, to succor men in
peril, if our affection as men may not incline us to lie?&#8221; If it
will hear me patiently, this crowd of mortality, crowd of
infirmity, I will say somewhat in answer on the behalf of truth.
Surely at the least pious, true, holy chastity is not otherwise
than of the truth: and whoso acts against it, acts against truth.
Why then, if otherwise it be not possible to succor men in peril,
do I not also commit whoredom, which is therefore contrary to
truth, for that it is contrary to chastity, and yet, to succor men
in peril, do speak a lie which most openly is contrary to truth
itself? Wherein hath chastity so highly deserved at our hands, and
truth offended us? When all chastity is of the truth, and not the
body&#8217;s but the mind&#8217;s chastity is truth, yea, in the mind
dwelleth even the body&#8217;s chastity. Lastly, as I shortly before
said, and say again, whoever for the recommending and defending of
any lie speaks against me, what speaks he, if he speaks not truth?
Now if he is therefore to be heard because he speaks truth, how
wishes he to make me, by speaking truth, a liar? How does lying
take unto itself truth as its patroness? Or, is it for her own
adversary that she conquers, that by herself she may be conquered?
Who can bear this absurdity? In no wise therefore may we say, that
they who assert that it is sometimes right to lie, in asserting
that are truthful; lest, what is most absurd and foolish to
believe, truth should teach us to be liars. For what sort of thing
is it, that no man learns of chastity that we may commit adultery;
that we may offend God none learns of piety; that we may do any man
harm, none learns of kindness; and that we may tell lies, we are to
learn of truth! But then if this thing truth teaches not, it is not
true; if not true, it is not meet to be learned; if not meet to be
learned, never therefore is it meet to tell a lie.</p>

way of indulgence is allowed to infirmity, although in her utmost
sincerity the things be nowise pleasing to truth. Let him say this,
whoever dreads not the consequences which are to be dreaded, if
once there shall be in any way any lies permitted. In nowise,
however, must they be permitted to climb up to such a height as to
reach to perjuries and blasphemies: nor must any plea whatever be
held out, for which it should be right that perjury should be
committed, or, what is more execrable, that God should be
blasphemed. For it does not follow that because the blaspheming is
only in pretence and a lie, therefore He is not blasphemed. For at
this rate it might be said that perjury is not committed, because
it is by a lie that it is committed: for who can be by truth a
perjurer? So also by truth can no man be a blasphemer. Doubtless it
is a milder kind of false swearing, when a person does not know
that thing to be false and believes it to be true, which he swears:
like as also Saul blasphemed more excusably, because he did it
ignorantly.<note place="end" n="2465" id="v.vi.xl-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi.xl-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. i. 13" id="v.vi.xl-p3.2" parsed="|1Tim|1|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.1.13">1 Tim. i. 13</scripRef></p></note> But the
reason why it is worse to blaspheme than to perjure one&#8217;s self,
is, that in false swearing God is taken to witness a false thing,
but in blaspheming false things are spoken of God Himself. Now by
so much is a man more inexcusable, whether perjurer or blasphemer,
by how much the more, while asserting the things wherein they
perjure or blaspheme, they know or believe them to be false.
Whoever therefore says that for an imperilled man&#8217;s temporal
safety or life a lie may be told, doth too much himself swerve from
the path of eternal safety and life, if he says that on that behalf
one may even swear by God, or even blaspheme God.</p>

which we are compelled, not for a man&#8217;s wealth or honors in this

tell a lie, whither shall I betake me for refuge but unto thee, O

keepers may be enticed to admit us to baptize the man, by our
committing lewdness, do we refuse to do things contrary to
chastity, and yet, if by a lie they may be deceived, consent to do
things contrary to truth? when without doubt no man would
faithfully think chastity amiable, but because it is enjoined of
truth? So then, to get at a man to baptize him, let the keepers be
deceived by lying, if truth bid it. But how can truth bid in order
that a man may be baptized, that we should tell a lie, if chastity
biddeth not, in order that a man be baptized, that we should commit
whoredom? Now <pb n="500" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_500.html" id="v.vi.xli-Page_500"/>why doth chastity not bid this,
but because this truth teacheth not? If then, save what truth
teacheth, we ought not to do, when truth teacheth not even for the
sake of baptizing a man to do what is contrary to chastity, how
shall she teach us to do for the sake of baptizing a man what is
contrary to herself, the truth? But like as eyes not strong enough
to look upon the sun yet do gladly look upon the objects which are
by the sun enlightened, so, souls which have already strength to
delight in the beauty of chastity are yet not straightway able to
consider in her very self that truth whence charity hath her light,
insomuch that when it cometh to the doing of somewhat that is
adverse to truth, they should so start back in horror as they do
start back in horror if aught be proposed to be done that is
adverse to chastity. But that son, who, receiving the word shall be

41. Either then we are to
eschew lies by right doing, or to confess them by repenting: but
not, while they unhappily abound in our living, to make them more
by teaching also. But let him who thinks this, choose out whereby
he may help his fellow man being in peril, to what safety he will,
what kinds soever of lies; provided yet even of such men we obtain
our demand, that upon no cause must we be carried on to
false-swearing and to blaspheming. These wickednesses at least let
us judge either greater than deeds of lewdness, or certainly not
smaller. For indeed it is worth thinking of, that very often men,
where they suspect them of adultery, challenge their wives to an
oath: which surely they would not do, unless they believed that
even they who were not afraid to perpetrate adultery, might be
afraid of perjury. Because in fact also some lewd women who were
not afraid by unlawful embraces to deceive their husbands, have
been afraid to call God deceitfully to witness unto those same
husbands whom they had deceived. What cause then can there be, that
a chaste and religious person should be unwilling by adultery to
help a man to baptism, yet be willing to help him by perjury, which
even adulterers are wont to dread? And then, if it be shocking to
do this by perjuring one&#8217;s self, how much rather by blaspheming?
Far be it then from a Christian to deny and blaspheme Christ, that
he may make another man a Christian; and by losing himself seek to
find one, whom, if he teach him such things, he may cause to be
lost when found. The book then which is called &#8220;the Pound,&#8221;
thou must in this method refute and destroy; namely, that head of
it in which they dogmatize that for the purpose of concealing
religion a lie may be told, this thou shall understand must be the
first to be amputated; in such manner, that their testimonies by
which they labor to advance the Holy Books as patrons of their
lies, thou must demonstrate partly not to be lies, partly, even
those which are such, to be not meet to be imitated: and if
infirmity usurps to herself thus much, that somewhat shall be
venially permitted unto her which truth approve not, yet that thou
unshakenly hold and defend, that in divine religion it is at no
time whatever right to tell a lie. And, as for concealed heretics,
that, as we are not to find out concealed adulterers by committing
of adulteries, nor murderers by committing of murders, nor
practisers of black arts<note place="end" n="2475" id="v.vi.xlii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vi.xlii-p2"> <i>Maleficos</i></p></note> by practising of black arts, so

Monks, the need which compelled me was this. When at Carthage there
had begun to be monasteries, some maintained themselves by their
own hands, obeying the Apostle; but others wished so to live on the
oblations of the faithful, that doing no work whence they might
either have or supply the necessaries of life, they thought and
boasted that they did rather fulfill the precept of the Gospel,
where the Lord saith, <i>Behold the fowls of heaven, and the lilies

tumultuous contests, whereby the Church was troubled, some
defending the one, others the other part. Add to this, that some of
them who were for not working, wore their hair long. Whence
contentions between those who reprehended and those who justified
the practice, were, according to their party affections, increased.

2. First then, it is to be

not be contrary to the Gospel, where the Lord Him<pb n="504" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_504.html" id="v.vii.iii-Page_504"/>self saith,
&#8220;Therefore I say unto you, be not solicitous for your life, what
ye shall eat, neither for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not
the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? Consider the
fowls of heaven, that they sow not, nor reap, nor gather into
barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye rather of
more worth than they? But who of you by taking thought can add to
his stature one cubit? And concerning raiment, why are ye
solicitous? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they
labor not, neither spin; but I say unto you, that not even Solomon
in all his glory was arrayed like one of these. But if the grass of
the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, God
so clotheth; how much more you, (O ye) of little faith! Be not
therefore solicitous, saying, What shall we eat, or what shall we
drink, or wherewithal shall we be clad? for all these things do the
Gentiles seek. And your heavenly Father knoweth that ye need all
these. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness,
and all these shall be added unto you. Be not therefore solicitous
for the morrow: for the morrow will be solicitous for itself.

Apostle worketh in planting, watering, building, and
foundation-laying, in that way whoso will not work, let him not
eat. For what profiteth in eating spiritually to be fed with the
word of God, if he do not thence work others&#8217; edification? As
that slothful servant, what did it profit to receive a talent and
to hide it, and not work for the Lord&#8217;s gain? Was it that it
should be taken from him at last, and himself cast into outer
darkness? So, say they, do we also. We read with the brethren, who
come to us fatigued from the turmoil of the world, that with us, in
the word of God, and in prayers, psalms, hymns, and spiritual
songs, they may find rest. We speak to them, console, exhort,
building up in them whatever unto their life, according to their
degree, we perceive to be lacking. Such works if we wrought not,
with peril should we receive of the Lord our spiritual sustenance
itself. For this is it the Apostle said, &#8220;If any one will not
work, neither let him eat.&#8221; Thus do these men deem themselves to
comply with the apostolic and evangelic sentence, when both the
Gospel they believe to have given precept concerning the not caring
for the corporal and temporal indigence of this life, and the
Apostle concerning spiritual work and food to have said, &#8220;If any
will not work, neither let him eat.&#8221;</p>

3. Nor do they attend to this,
that if another should say, that the Lord indeed, speaking in
parables and in similitudes concerning spiritual food and clothing,
did warn that not on these accounts should His servants be
solicitous; (as He saith, &#8220;When they shall drag you to
judgment-seats, take no thought what ye shall speak. For it will be
given you in that hour what ye shall speak: but it is not ye that

discourse of spiritual wisdom is that for which He would not that
they should take thought, promising that it should be given unto
them, nothing solicitous thereof;) but the Apostle now, in manner
Apostolical, more openly discoursing and more properly, than
figuratively speaking, as is the case with much, indeed well-nigh
all, in his Apostolic Epistles, said it properly of corporal work
and food, &#8220;If any will not work, neither let him eat:&#8221; by those
would their sentence be rendered doubtful, unless, considering the
other words of the Lord, they should find somewhat whereby they
might prove it to have been of not caring for corporal food and
raiment that He spoke when He said, &#8220;Be not solicitous what ye
shall eat, or what ye shall drink, or wherewithal ye shall be
clothed.&#8221; As, if they should observe what He saith, &#8220;For all
these things do the Gentiles seek;&#8221; for there He shows that it
was of very corporal and temporal things that He spake. So then,
were this the only thing that the Apostle has said on this subject,
&#8220;If any will not work, neither let him eat;&#8221; these words might
be drawn over to another mean<pb n="505" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_505.html" id="v.vii.iv-Page_505"/>ing: but since in many other
places of his Epistles, what is his mind on this point, he most
openly teaches, they superfluously essay to raise a mist before
themselves and others, that what that charity adviseth they may not
only refuse to do, but even to understand it themselves, or let it
be understood by others; not fearing that which is written, &#8220;He
would not understand that he might do good.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2480" id="v.vii.iv-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.iv-p3"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xxxvi. 3" id="v.vii.iv-p3.2" parsed="|Ps|36|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.36.3">Ps. xxxvi. 3</scripRef>, (35,

4. First then we ought to
demonstrate that the blessed Apostle Paul willed the servants of
God to work corporal works which should have as their end a great
spiritual reward, for this purpose that they should need food and
clothing of no man, but with their own hands should procure these
for themselves: then, to show that those evangelical precepts from
which some cherish not only their sloth but even arrogance, are not
contrary to the Apostolical precept and example. Let us see then
whence the Apostle came to this, that he should say, &#8220;If any will
not work, neither let him eat,&#8221; and what he thereupon joineth on,
that from the very context<note place="end" n="2481" id="v.vii.v-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.v-p2"> 
&#8220;<i>Circumstantia</i>.&#8221;</p></note> of this lesson may appear his
declared sentence. &#8220;We command you, brethren, in the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother
that walketh unquietly, and not according to the tradition which
they have received<note place="end" n="2482" id="v.vii.v-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.v-p3"> 
&#8220;<i>Acceperunt</i>.&#8221;</p></note> of us. For yourselves know how ye
ought to imitate us; for we were not unquiet among you, neither ate
we bread of any man for nought, but in labor and travail night and
day working that we might not burden any of you: not for that we
have not power, but that we might give ourselves as a pattern to
you in which ye should imitate us. For also when we were with you,
we gave you this charge, that if any will not work, let him not
eat. For we have heard that certain among you walk unquietly,
working not at all, but being busy-bodies. Now them that are such
we charge and beseech in our Lord Jesus Christ, that with silence
they work, and eat their own bread.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2483" id="v.vii.v-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.v-p4"> <scripRef passage="2 Thess. iii. 6-12" id="v.vii.v-p4.2" parsed="|2Thess|3|6|3|12" osisRef="Bible:2Thess.3.6-2Thess.3.12">2 Thess. iii. 6&#8211;12</scripRef></p></note> What can be said to these things,
since, that none might thereafter have license to interpret this

example hath taught what by precept he hath enjoined? To him,
namely, as to an Apostle, a preacher of the Gospel, a soldier of
Christ, a planter of the vineyard, a shepherd of the flock had the
Lord appointed that he should live by the Gospel; and yet himself
exacted not the pay which was his due, that he might make himself a
pattern to them which desired what was not their due; as he saith
to the Corinthians, &#8220;Who goeth a warfare at any time at his own
charges? Who planteth a vineyard, and of its fruit eateth not? Who
feedeth a flock, and of the milk of the flock partaketh not?&#8221;<note place="end" n="2484" id="v.vii.v-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.v-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 1-7" id="v.vii.v-p5.2" parsed="|1Cor|9|1|9|7" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.1-1Cor.9.7">1 Cor. ix. 1&#8211;7</scripRef></p></note> Therefore,
what was due to him, he would not receive, that by his example they
might be checked, who, although not so ordained in the Church, did
deem the like to be due to themselves. For what is it that he
saith, &#8220;Neither ate we bread of any man for naught, but in labor
and travail night and day working that we might not burden any of
you; not for that we have not power, but that we might give
ourselves as a pattern to you wherein ye should follow us?&#8221; Let
them, therefore, hear to whom he hath given this precept, that is,
they which have not this power which he had, to wit, that while
only spiritually working they should eat bread by corporal labor
not earned:<note place="end" n="2485" id="v.vii.v-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.v-p6"> <i>Gratuitum</i></p></note> and as he
says, &#8220;We charge and beseech in Christ that with silence they
work and eat their own bread,&#8221; let them not dispute against the
most manifest words of the Apostle, because this also pertaineth to
that &#8220;silence&#8221; with which they ought to work and eat their own
bread.</p>

handling of these words, had I not other places of his Epistles
much more manifest, by comparing which, both these are made more
clearly manifest, and if these were not in existence, those others
would suffice. To the Corinthians, namely, writing of this same

the other Apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?&#8221;
See how first he shows what is lawful to him, and therefore lawful
for that he is an Apostle. For with that he began, &#8220;Am I not
free? am I not an Apostle?&#8221; and proves himself to be an Apostle,
saying, &#8220;Have I not seen Christ Jesus our Lord? Are not ye my
work in the Lord?&#8221; Which being proved, he shows that to be lawful
to him which was so to the other Apostles; that is, that he should
not work with his hands, but live by the Gospel, as the Lord
appointed, which in what follows he has most <pb n="506" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_506.html" id="v.vii.vi-Page_506"/>openly
demonstrated; for to this end did also faithful women which had
earthly substance go with them, and minister unto them of their
substance, that they might lack none of those things which pertain
to the necessities of this life. Which thing blessed Paul
demonstrates to be lawful indeed unto himself, as also the other
Apostles did it, but that he had not chosen to use this power he
afterwards mentions. This thing some not understanding, have
interpreted not &#8220;a woman which is a sister,&#8221; when he said,
&#8220;Have we not power to lead about a sister a woman;&#8221; but, &#8220;a
sister a wife.&#8221; They were misled by the ambiguity of the Greek
word, because both &#8220;wife&#8221; and &#8220;woman&#8221; is expressed in Greek
by the same word. Though indeed the Apostle has so put this that
they ought not to have made this mistake; for that he neither says
&#8220;a woman&#8221; merely, but &#8220;a sister woman;&#8221; nor &#8220;to take&#8221;
(as in marriage), but &#8220;to take about&#8221; (as on a journey).
Howbeit other interpreters have not been misled by this ambiguity,
and they have interpreted &#8220;woman&#8221; not &#8220;wife.&#8221;</p>

6. Which thing whoso thinks
cannot have been done by the Apostles, that with them women of holy
conversation should go about wheresoever they preached the Gospel,
that of their substance they might minister to their necessities,
let him hear the Gospel, and learn how in this they did after the
example of the Lord Himself. Our Lord, namely, according to the
wont of His pity, sympathizing with the weak, albeit Angels might
minister unto Him, had both a bag in which should be put the money
which was bestowed doubtless by good and believing persons, as
necessary for their living, (which bag He gave in charge to Judas,

put therein:&#8221;) and He willed that women should follow Him for the
preparing and ministering what was necessary, showing what was due
to evangelists and ministers of God as soldiers, from the people of
God as the provincials; so that if any should not choose to use
that which is due unto him, as Paul the Apostle did not choose, he
might bestow the more upon the Church, by not exacting the pay
which was due to him, but by earning his daily living of his own
labors. For it had been said to the inn-keeper to whom that wounded

hire;&#8221; and proposing Himself as an example of the same power, to
Whom most faithful women did of their means minister such
necessaries? But the Apostle Paul hath done more, from his
fellow-Apostles alleging a proof of this license permitted of the
Lord. For not as finding fault hath he subjoined, &#8220;As do also the
other Apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas;&#8221; but
that hence he might show that this which he would not accept was a
thing which, that it was lawful for him to accept was proved by the
wont of the rest also his fellow-soldiers. &#8220;Or I only and
Barnabas, have we not power to forbear working?&#8221; Lo, he hath
taken away all doubt even from the slowest hearts, that they may
understand of what working he speaks. For to what end saith he,
&#8220;Or I only and Barnabas, have we not power to forbear working?&#8221;
but for that all evangelists and ministers of God&#8217;s word had
power received of the Lord, not to work with their hands, but to
live by the Gospel, working only spiritual works in preaching of
the kingdom of heaven and edifying of the peace of the Church? For
no man can say that it is of that very spiritual working that the
Apostle said, &#8220;Or I only and Barnabas, have we not power to
forbear working?&#8221; For this power to forbear working all those
had: let him say then, who essays to deprave and pervert precepts
Apostolical; let him say, if he dares that all evangelists received
of the Lord power to forbear preaching the Gospel. But if this is
most absurd and mad to say, why will they not understand what is
plain to all, that they did indeed receive power not to work, but
works bodily, whereby to get a living, because &#8220;the workman is
worthy of his hire,&#8221; as the Gospel speaks. It is not therefore
that Paul and Barnabas only had not power to forbear working; but
that all alike had this power of which these availed not themselves
in &#8220;laying out more&#8221; upon the Church; so as in those places
where they preached the Gospel they judged to be meet for the weak.
And for this reason, that he might not seem to have found fault
with his fellow-Apostles, he goes on to say: &#8220;Who goeth a warfare
at any time at his own charges? Who feedeth a flock, and of the
milk of the flock partaketh not? Speak I these things as a man?
Saith not the Law the same? For in the law of Moses it is written,
Thou shall not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God
care for oxen? Or saith he it for our sake altogether? For our
sakes truly is it written, because he that plougheth ought to
plough in hope, and he that thresheth in hope of partaking of the
fruits.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2497" id="v.vii.ix-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.ix-p4"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 7-10" id="v.vii.ix-p4.2" parsed="|1Cor|9|7|9|10" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.7-1Cor.9.10">1 Cor. ix. 7&#8211;10</scripRef>. [See

words the Apostle Paul sufficiently indicates, that it was no
usurping unto themselves of aught beyond their due on the part of
his fellow-Apostles, that they wrought not bodily, whence they
might have the things which to this life are necessary, but as the
Lord ordained, should, living by the Gospel, eat bread gratuitously
given of them unto whom they were preaching a gratuitous grace.
Their charges, namely, they did like soldiers receive, and of the
fruit of the vineyard by them planted, they did, as need was,
freely gather; and of the milk of the flock which they fed, they
drank; and of the threshing-floor on which they threshed, they took
their meat.</p>

to have wrought, whereby he should get his living, but bodily work,

food, when himself openly says that he had not used this power. But

which, by persons not understanding and not enough attending, he
has been accounted to have feigned. For he was a Jew, and was
called being circumcised; therefore he would not become
uncircumcised; that is, would not so live as if he had not been
circumcised. For this he now had in his power to do. And
&#8220;under&#8221; the law, indeed, he was not as they who servilely
wrought it; but yet &#8220;in&#8221; the law of God and of Christ. For that
law was not one, and the law of God another, as accursed Manicheans
are wont to say. Otherwise, if when he did those things he is to be
accounted to have feigned, then he feigned himself also a pagan,
and sacrificed to idols, because he says that he became to those
without law, as without law. By whom, doubtless, he would have us
to understand no other than Gentiles whom we call Pagans. It is one
thing therefore to be under the law, another in the law, another
without law. &#8220;Under the law,&#8221; the carnal Jews; &#8220;in the
law,&#8221; spiritual men, both Jews and Christians; (whence the former
kept that custom of their fathers, but did not impose unwonted
burdens upon the believing Gentiles; and therefore they also were
circumcised;) but &#8220;without law,&#8221; are the Gentiles which have
not yet believed, to whom yet the Apostle testifieth himself to
have become like, through sympathy of a merciful heart, not
simulation of a changeable exterior; that is, that he might in that
way succor carnal Jew or Pagan, in which way himself, if he were
that, would have wished to be succored: bearing, to wit, their
infirmity, in likeness of compassion, not deceiving in fiction of
lying; as he straightway goes on, and says, &#8220;I became to the weak

was speaking, in saying all those other things. As then, that he
became to the weak as weak, was no lie; so all those other things
above rehearsed. For what doth he mean his weakness towards the
weak to have been, but that of suffering with them, insomuch that,
lest he should appear to be a seller of the Gospel, and by falling

course of God&#8217;s word, he would not accept what by warrant of the
Lord was his due? Which if he were willing to accept, he would not
in any wise lie, because it was truly due to him; and for that he
would not, he did not in any wise lie. For he did not say, it was
not due; but he showed it to be due, and that being due he had not
used it, and professed that he would not at all use it, in that
very thing becoming weak; namely, in that he would not use his
power; being, to wit, with so merciful affection endued, that he
thought in what way he should wish to be dealt withal, if himself
also were made so weak, that possibly, if he should see them by
whom the Gospel was preached to him, accepting their charges, he
might think it a bringing of wares to market, and hold them in
suspicion accordingly.</p>

brethren, our labor and toil, night and day working, that we might
not burden any of you.&#8221; For this he said above, &#8220;When we might
be burdensome to you, as Christ&#8217;s Apostles.&#8221; Because, then, the
weak were in peril, lest, agitated by false suspicions, they should
hate an, as it were, venal Gospel, for this cause, trembling for
them as with a father&#8217;s and a mother&#8217;s bowels of compassion,
did he this thing. So too in the Acts of the Apostles he speaks the
same thing, when, sending from Miletus to Ephesus, he had called
thence the presbyters of the Church, to whom, among much else,
&#8220;Silver,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;and gold, or apparel of no man have I
coveted; yourselves know, that to my necessities and theirs who
were with me these hands have ministered. In all things have I
shown you that so laboring it behoveth to help the weak, mindful
also of the words of the Lord Jesus, for that He said, More blessed
is it rather to give than to receive.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2514" id="v.vii.xiv-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.xiv-p6"> <scripRef passage="Acts xx. 33-35" id="v.vii.xiv-p6.2" parsed="|Acts|20|33|20|35" osisRef="Bible:Acts.20.33-Acts.20.35">Acts xx. 33&#8211;35</scripRef></p></note></p>

14. Here peradventure some
man may <pb n="511" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_511.html" id="v.vii.xv-Page_511"/>say, &#8220;If it was bodily work that the Apostle wrought,
whereby to sustain this life, what was that same work, and when did
he find time for it, both to work and to preach the Gospel?&#8221; To
whom I answer: Suppose I do not know; nevertheless that he did
bodily work, and thereby lived in the flesh, and did not use the
power which the Lord had given to the Apostles, that preaching the
Gospel he should live by the Gospel, those things above-said do
without all doubt bear witness. For it is not either in one place
or briefly said, that it should be possible for any most astute
arguer with all his tergiversation to traduce and pervert it to
another meaning. Since then so great an authority, with so mighty
and so frequent blows mauling the gainsayers, doth break in pieces
their contrariness, why ask they of me either what sort of work he
did, or when he did it? One thing I know, that he neither did
steal, nor was a housebreaker or highwayman, nor chariot-driver or
hunter or player, nor given to filthy lucre: but innocently and
honestly wrought things which are fitted for the uses of men; such
as are the works of carpenters, builders, shoemakers, peasants, and
such like. For honesty itself reprehends not what their pride doth
reprehend, who love to be called, but love not to be, honest. The
Apostle then would not disdain either to take in hand any work of
peasants, or to be employed in the labor of craftsmen. For he who
saith, &#8220;Be ye without offense to Jews and to Greeks and to the
Church of God,&#8221;<note place="end" n="2515" id="v.vii.xv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.xv-p2"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 32" id="v.vii.xv-p2.2" parsed="|1Cor|10|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.32">1 Cor. x. 32</scripRef></p></note> before what men he could possibly
stand abashed, I know not. If they shall say, the Jews; the

therefore of these with innocence and without fraud men do work, is

works. &#8220;Let him that stole,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;steal no more; but

17. On account then of these
either occupations of the servants of God, or bodily infirmities,
which cannot be altogether wanting, not only doth the Apostle
permit the needs of saints to be supplied by good believers, but
also most wholesomely exhorteth. For, setting apart that power,
which he saith himself had not used, which yet that the faithful
must serve unto, he enjoins, saying, &#8220;Let him that is catechised

apart, then, this power, which that the preachers of the word have
over them to whom they preach, he often testifieth; speaking,
moreover, of the saints who had sold all that they had and

communion of life, not saying that any thing was their own, to whom
all things were in common,<note place="end" n="2532" id="v.vii.xviii-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.xviii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Acts ii. 44" id="v.vii.xviii-p3.2" parsed="|Acts|2|44|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.2.44">Acts ii. 44</scripRef>: iv. 32</p></note> and their soul and heart one in
the Lord: that these by the Churches of the Gentiles should have

Jerusalem, to minister unto the saints. For it hath pleased
Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor of
the saints which are at Jerusalem. For it hath pleased them; and

the Corinthians in the second Epistle: &#8220;Moreover, brethren, we do
you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the Churches of
Macedonia; how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of
their joy and their deep poverty abounded in the riches of their
liberality; for to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond
their power, they were willing of themselves; with many prayers
beseeching of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministering to
the saints: and not as we hoped, but first they gave their own
selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God, insomuch, that
we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in
you the same grace also. But as ye abound in every thing, in faith,
and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your
love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also. I speak not by
commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to
prove the exceeding dearness of your love. For ye know the grace of
our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich, yet for your sakes
He became poor, that ye through His poverty might be made rich. And
herein I give advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun
before, not only to do, but also to be willing a year ago; now
therefore perfect it in the doing; that as there is a readiness to
will, so of performance also out of that which each hath. For if
there be first a ready mind, it is acceptable according to that a
man hath, not according to that he hath not. Not, namely, that
others may have ease, and ye straits; but by an equality,
that <pb n="513" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_513.html" id="v.vii.xviii-Page_513"/>now at this time your abundance may be a supply for
their want, that their abundance also may become a supply for your
want: that there may be equality, as it is written, He that had
gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had
no lack. But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care for
you into the heart of Titus: for indeed he accepted the
exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went
forth unto you. And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise
is in the Gospel throughout all the Churches; and not that only,
but he was also ordained of the Churches as a companion of our
travail, with this grace which is administered by us to the glory
of the Lord, and our ready mind: avoiding this, that no man should
blame us in this abundance which is administered by us. For we
provide for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but

blessed Apostle saith to be so great in this ministration which was
now in transmitting through Titus, that a companion of his journey
was on this account, he tells us, ordained by the Churches, a man
of God well reported of, &#8220;whose praise,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is in the
Gospel throughout all the Churches.&#8221; And to this end, he says,
was the same ordained to be his companion, that he might avoid
men&#8217;s reprehensions, lest, without witness of saints associated
with him in this ministry, he should be thought by weak and impious
men to receive for himself and turn aside into his own bosom, what
he was receiving for supplying the necessities of the saints, by
him to be brought and distributed to the needy.</p>

18. And a little after he
saith, &#8220;For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is
superfluous for me to write to you. For I know the forwardness of
your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that
Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.
Yet have we sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be
in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready: lest
haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared,
we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this substance.
Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they
would go before unto you, and make up beforehand this your long
promised benediction, that the same might be ready, as benediction,
and not as covetousness. But this I say, He which soweth sparingly
shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth in benediction shall
reap also in benediction. Every man according as he hath purposed
in his heart, not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a
cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound in you;
that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to
every good work: as it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he
hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever. But
He that ministereth seed to the sower will both minister bread for
your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the growing
fruits of your righteousness; that ye may be enriched in every
thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving
to God: for the administration of this service not only supplieth
the want of the saints, but makes them also to abound by
thanksgiving unto God of many, while by the proof of this
ministration they glorify God for the obedience of your confession
unto the Gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto
them, and unto all men; and in the praying for you of them which
long after you for the excellent grace of God in you. Thanks be

19. As therefore the Apostle,
nay rather the Spirit of God possessing and filling and actuating
his heart, ceased not to exhort the faithful who had such
substance, that nothing should be lacking to the necessities of the
servants of God, who wished to hold a more lofty degree of sanctity
in the Church, in cutting off all ties of secular hope, and
dedicating a mind at liberty to their godly service <pb n="514" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_514.html" id="v.vii.xx-Page_514"/>of warfare:
likewise ought themselves also to obey his precepts, in
sympathizing with the weak, and unshackled by love of private
wealth, to labor with their hands for the common good, and submit
to their superiors without a murmur; that there may be made up for
them out of the oblations of good believers that which, while they
labor and do some work whereby they may get their living, yet still
by reason of bodily infirmities of some, and by reason of
ecclesiastical occupations or erudition of the doctrine which
bringeth salvation, they shall account to be lacking.</p>

20. For what these men are
about, who will not do bodily work, to what thing they give up
their time, I should like to know. &#8220;To prayers,&#8221; say they,
&#8220;and psalms, and reading, and the word of God.&#8221; A holy life,
unquestionably, and in sweetness of Christ worthy of praise; but
then, if from these we are not to be called off, neither must we
eat, nor our daily viands themselves be prepared, that they may be
put before us and taken. Now if to find time for these things the
servants of God at certain intervals of times by very infirmity are
of necessity compelled, why do we not make account of some portions
of times to be allotted also to the observance of Apostolical
precepts? For one single prayer of one who obeyeth is sooner heard
than ten thousand of a despiser. As for divine songs, however, they
can easily, even while working with their hands, say them, and like
as rowers with a boat-song,<note place="end" n="2541" id="v.vii.xxi-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.xxi-p2"> <i>Celeumate</i></p></note> so with godly melody cheer up
their very toil. Or are we ignorant how it is with all workmen, to
what vanities, and for the most part even filthinesses, of
theatrical fables they give their hearts and tongues, while their
hands recede not from their work? What then hinders a servant of
God while working with his hands to meditate in the law of the
Lord, and sing unto the Name of the Lord Most High?<note place="end" n="2542" id="v.vii.xxi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.xxi-p3"> <scripRef passage="Ps. i. 2" id="v.vii.xxi-p3.2" parsed="|Ps|1|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.1.2">Ps. i. 2</scripRef>; xiii. 6</p></note> provided,
of course, that to learn what he may by memory rehearse, he have
times set apart. For to this end also those good works of the
faithful ought not to be lacking, for resource of making up what is
necessary, that the hours which are so taken up in storing of the
mind that those bodily works cannot be carried on, may not oppress
with want. But they which say that they give up their time to
reading, do they not there find that which the Apostle enjoineth?
Then what perversity is this, to refuse to be ruled by his reading
while he wishes to give up his time thereto; and that he may spend
more time in reading what is good, therefore to refuse to do what
is read? For who knows not that each doth the more quickly profit
when he reads good things, the quicker he is in doing what he
reads?</p>

21. Moreover, if discourse
must be bestowed upon any, and this so take up the speaker that he
have not time to work with his hands, are all in the monastery able
to hold discourse unto brethren which come unto them from another
kind of life, whether it be to expound the divine lessons, or
concerning any questions which may be put, to reason in an
wholesome manner? Then since not all have the ability, why upon
this pretext do all want to have nothing else to do? Although even
if all were able, they ought to do it by turns; not only that the
rest might not be taken up from necessary works, but also because
it sufficeth that to many hearers there be one speaker. To come now
to the Apostle; how could he find time to work with his hands,
unless for the bestowing of the word of God he had certain set
times? And indeed God hath not willed this either to be hidden from
us. For both of what craft he was a workman, and at what times he
was taken up with dispensing the Gospel, holy Scripture has not
left untold. Namely, when the day of his departure caused him to be
in haste, being at Troas, even on the first day of the week when
the brethren were assembled to break bread, such was his
earnestness, and so necessary the disputation, that his discourse
was prolonged even until midnight,<note place="end" n="2543" id="v.vii.xxii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.xxii-p2"> <scripRef passage="Acts xx. 7" id="v.vii.xxii-p2.2" parsed="|Acts|20|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.20.7">Acts xx. 7</scripRef></p></note> as though it had slipped from

fact he could work both at other hours and of nights, because he

however, where through necessity of his departure being close at
hand, his discourse was protracted until midnight, it was the first
day of the week, which is called the Lord&#8217;s Day: whence we
understand that he was not with Jews but with Christians; when also
the narrator himself saith they were gathered together to break
bread. And indeed this same is the best management, that all things
be distributed to their times and be done in order, lest becoming
ravelled in perplexing entanglements, they throw our human mind
into confusion.</p>

22. There also is said at
what work the Apostle wrought. &#8220;After these things,&#8221; it says,
&#8220;he departed from Athens and came to Corinth; and having found a
certain Jew, by name Aquila, of Pontus by birth, lately come from
Italy, and Priscilla his wife, because that Claudius had ordered
all Jews to depart from Rome, he came unto them, and because he was
of the same craft he abode with them, doing work: for they were

rest of this kind, let them either expound otherwise, or if by most
clear shining light of truth they be put to it, let them understand
and obey; or if to obey they be either unwilling or unable, at
least let them own them which be willing, to be better, and them
which be also able, to be happier men than they. For it is one
thing to plead infirmity of body, either truly alleged, or falsely
pretended: but another so to be deceived and so to deceive, that it
shall even be thought a proof of righteousness obtaining more
mightily in servants of God, if laziness have gotten power to reign
among a set of ignorant men. He, namely, who shows a true infirmity
of body, must be humanely dealt withal; he who pretends a false
one, and cannot be convicted, must be left unto God: yet neither of
them fixeth a pernicious rule; because a good servant of God both
serves his manifestly infirm brother; and, when the other deceives,
if he believes him because he does not think him a bad man, he does
not imitate him that he may be bad; and if he believe him not; he
thinks him deceitful, and does, nevertheless, not imitate him. But
when a man says, &#8220;This is true righteousness, that by doing no
bodily work we imitate the birds of the air, because he who shall
do any such work, goes against the Gospel:&#8221; whoso being infirm in
mind hears and believes this, that person, not for that he so
bestows all his time, but for that he so erreth, must be mourned
over.</p>

23. Hence arises another
question; for peradventure one may say, &#8220;What then? did the other
Apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas, sin, in that
they did not work? Or did they occasion an hindrance to the Gospel,
because blessed Paul saith that he had not used this power on
purpose that he might not cause any hindrance to the Gospel of
Christ? For if they sinned because they wrought not, then had they
not received power not to work, but to live instead by the Gospel.
But if they had received this power, by ordinance of the Lord, that
they which preach the Gospel should live by the Gospel; and by His
saying, &#8220;The workman is worthy of his meat;&#8221; which power Paul,
laying out somewhat more,<note place="end" n="2554" id="v.vii.xxiv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.xxiv-p2"> <i>Amplius aliquid
erogans</i></p></note> would not use; then truly they
sinned not. If they sinned not, they caused no hindrance. For it is
not to be thought no sin to hinder the Gospel.<note place="end" n="2555" id="v.vii.xxiv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.xxiv-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 12" id="v.vii.xxiv-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|9|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.12">1 Cor. ix. 12</scripRef></p></note> If this be so, &#8220;to us also,&#8221;

24. This question I should
briefly solve, if I should say, because I should also justly say,
that we must believe the Apostle. For he himself knew why in the
Churches of the Gentiles it was not meet that a venal Gospel were
carried about; not finding fault with his fellow-apostles, but
distinguishing his own ministry; because they, without doubt by
admonition of the Holy Ghost, had so distributed among them the
provinces of evangelizing, that Paul and Barnabas should go
<pb n="516" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_516.html" id="v.vii.xxv-Page_516"/>unto
the Gentiles, and they unto the Circumcision.<note place="end" n="2556" id="v.vii.xxv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.xxv-p2"> <scripRef passage="Acts xiii. 2" id="v.vii.xxv-p2.2" parsed="|Acts|13|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.13.2">Acts xiii. 2</scripRef>; <scripRef passage="Gal. ii. 9" id="v.vii.xxv-p2.3" parsed="|Gal|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.2.9">Gal. ii.

them who had not the like power, those many things already said do
make manifest. But these brethren of ours rashly arrogate unto
themselves, so far as I can judge, that they have this kind of
power. For if they be evangelists, I confess, they have it: if
ministers of the altar, dispensers of sacraments, of course it is
no arrogating to themselves, but a plain vindicating of a
right.</p>

had in this world wherewithal they might easily without handiwork
sustain this life, which property, when they were converted unto
God, they disparted to the needy, then must we both believe their
infirmity, and bear with it. For usually such persons, having been,
not better brought up, as many think, but what is the truth, more
languidly brought up, are not able to bear the labor of bodily
works. Such peradventure were many in Jerusalem. For it is also

handicraftsmen, persons whose bringing up doubtless has been all
the better for them, the harder it has been: whom not to admit, is
a heavy sin. For many of that sort have turned out truly great men
and meet to be imitated. For on this account also &#8220;hath God
chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which
are mighty, and the foolish things of the world hath He chosen to
confound them who are wise; and ignoble things of the world, and
things which are not, as though they were, that the things that are

to be fed and clothed; yea, moreover, to be honored by them of whom
they were wont to be despised and trampled on. Such persons
therefore because they cannot excuse themselves from working by
pleading infirmity of body, seeing they are convicted by the custom
of their past life, do therefore shelter themselves under the
screen of an ill scholarship, that from the Gospel badly understood
they should essay to pervert precepts apostolical: truly &#8220;fowls

accusing mercy as the prevaricator therefrom. For a much more
merciful work is it to the souls of the weak, to consult for the
fair fame of the servants of God, than it is to the bodies of men,
to break bread to the hungry. Wherefore I would to God that these,
which want to let their hands lie idle, would altogether let their
tongues lie idle too. For they would not make so many willing to
imitate them, if the examples they set were not merely lazy ones,
but mute withal.</p>

27. As it is,
however, they, against the Apostle of Christ, recite a Gospel of
Christ. For so marvellous are the works of the sluggards, hindered
that they want to have that very thing by Gospel, which the Apostle
enjoined and did on purpose that the Gospel itself should not be
hindered. And yet, if from the very words of the Gospel we should
compel them to live agreeably with their way of understanding it,
they will be the first to endeavor to persuade us how they are not
to be understood so as they do understand them. For certainly, they
say that they therefore ought not to work, for that the birds of
the air neither sow nor reap, of which the Lord hath given us a
similitude that we should take no thought about such necessaries.
Then why do they not attend to that which follows? For it is not
only said, that &#8220;they sow not, neither reap;&#8221;<note place="end" n="2565" id="v.vii.xxviii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.xxviii-p2"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 6.26" id="v.vii.xxviii-p2.1" parsed="|Matt|6|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.26">Matt. vi. 26</scripRef></p></note> but there

Then why do these persons want to have idle hands and full
repositories? Why do they lay by and keep what they receive of the
labors of others, that thereof may be every day somewhat
forthcoming? Why, in short, do they grind and cook? For the birds
do not this. Or, if they find some whom they may persuade to this
work also, namely, to bring unto them day by day viands ready made;
at least their water they either fetch them from springs, or from
cisterns and wells draw and set it by: this the fowls do not. But
if so please them, let it be the study of good believers and most
devoted subjects of the Eternal King, to carry their service to His
most valiant soldiers even to that length, that they shall not be
forced even to fill a vessel of water for themselves, if now-a-days
people have surpassed even them which at that time were at
Jerusalem, in a new grade of righteousness, stepping out beyond
them. To them, namely, by reason of famine being imminent, and
foretold by the Prophets which were at that time,<note place="end" n="2566" id="v.vii.xxviii-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.xxviii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Acts xi. 28-30" id="v.vii.xxviii-p3.2" parsed="|Acts|11|28|11|30" osisRef="Bible:Acts.11.28-Acts.11.30">Acts xi. 28&#8211;30</scripRef></p></note> good
believers sent out of Greece supplies of corn; of which I suppose
they made them bread, or at least procured to be made; which thing
the birds do not. But if now-a-days these persons, as I began to
say, have surpassed these in some grade of righteousness, and do
altogether in things pertaining to the maintenance of this life, as
do the birds; let them show us men doing such service unto birds as
they wish to be done unto them, except indeed birds caught and
caged because they are not trusted, lest if they fly they come not
back: and yet these would rather enjoy liberty and receive from the
fields what is enough, than take their food by men laid before them
and made ready.</p>

28. Here then shall these
persons in their turn be in another more sublime degree of
righteousness outdone, by them who shall so order themselves, that
every day they shall betake them into the fields as unto pasture,
and at what time they shall find it, pick up their meal, and having
allayed their hunger, return. But plainly, on account of the
keepers of the fields, how good were it, if the Lord should deign
to bestow wings also, that the servants of God being found in other
men&#8217;s fields should not be taken up as thieves, but as starlings
be scared off. As things are, however, such an one will do all he
can to be like a bird, which the fowler shall not be able to catch.
But, lo, let all men allow this to the servants of God, that when
they will they should go forth into their fields, and thence depart
fearless and refreshed: as it was ordered to the people Israel by
the law, that none should lay hands on a thief in his fields,

29. But let us grant this
also, that the whole year round there may in the fields be found
either of tree or of herbs or of any manner of roots, that which
may be taken as food uncooked; or, at any rate, let so great
exercise of body be used, that the things which require cooking,
may be taken even raw without hurt, and people may even in winter
weather, no matter how rough, go forth to their fodder; and so it
shall be the case that nothing be taken away to be prepared,
nothing laid up for the morrow. Yet will not those men be able to
keep these rules, who for many days separating themselves from
sight of men, and allowing none access to them, do shut themselves
up, living in great earnestness of prayers. For these do use to
shut up with themselves store of aliments, <pb n="518" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_518.html" id="v.vii.xxx-Page_518"/>such indeed

suffice for those days during which they purpose that no man shall
see them; which thing the birds do not. Now touching these men&#8217;s
exercising of themselves in so marvellous continency, seeing that
they have leisure for the doing of these things, and not in proud
elation but in merciful sanctity do propose themselves for men&#8217;s

it as much as it deserves. And yet what are we to say of such men,
according to these persons&#8217; understanding of the evangelical
words? Or haply the holier they be, the more unlike are they to the
fowls? because unless they lay by for themselves food for many

of relinquishing our old resources, and of working with our hands.
But we too, aided by the Lord Himself, are able perchance in some
sort to apprehend what it doth still profit the servants of God to
have left their former businesses, while they do yet thus work. For
if a person from being rich is converted to this mode of life, and
is hindered by no infirmity of body, are we so without taste of the
savor of Christ, as not to understand what an healing it is to the
swelling of the old pride, when, having pared off the superfluities
by which erewhile the mind was deadly inflamed, he refuses not, for
the procuring of that little which is still naturally necessary for
this present life, even a common workman&#8217;s lowly toil? If however
he be from a poor estate converted unto this manner of life, let
him not account himself <pb n="519" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_519.html" id="v.vii.xxxiii-Page_519"/>to be doing that which he was

33. Wherefore even they which
having relinquished or distributed their former, whether ample or
in any sort opulent, means, have chosen with pious and wholesome
humility to be numbered among the poor of Christ; if they be so
strong in body and free from ecclesiastical occupations, (albeit,
bringing as they do so great a proof of their purpose, and
conferring from their former havings, either very much, or not a
little, upon the indigence of the same society, the common fund
itself and brotherly charity owes them in return a sustenance of
their life,) yet if they too work with their hands, that they may
take away all excuse from lazy brethren who come from a more humble
condition in life, and therefore one more used to toil; therein
they act far more mercifully than when they divided all their goods
to the needy. If indeed they be unwilling to do this, who can
venture to compel them? Yet then there ought to be found for them
works in the monastery, which if more free from bodily exercise,
require to be looked unto with vigilant administration, that not
even they may eat their bread for nought, because it is now become
the common property. Nor is it to be regarded in what monasteries,
or in what place, any man may have bestowed his former having upon
his indigent brethren. For all Christians make one commonwealth.
And for that cause whoso shall have, no matter in what place,
expended upon Christians the things they needed, in what place

goods<note place="end" n="2581" id="v.vii.xxxiv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.xxxiv-p2"> <i>De Christi</i></p></note> he doth
receive it. Because in what place soever himself has given to such,
who but Christ received it? But, as for them who before they
entered this holy society got their living by labor of the body, of
which sort are the more part of them which come into monasteries,
because of mankind also the more part are such; if they will not
work, neither let them eat. For not to that end are the rich, in
this Christian warfare, brought low unto piety, that the poor may
be lifted up unto pride. As indeed it is by no means seemly that in
that mode of life where senators become men of toil, there common
workmen should become men of leisure; and whereunto there come,
relinquishing their dainties, men who had been masters of houses
and lands, there common peasants should be dainty.</p>

34. But then the Lord saith,
&#8220;Be not solicitous for your life what ye shall eat, nor for the
body, what ye shall put on.&#8221; Rightly: because He had said above,
&#8220;Ye cannot serve God and mammon.&#8221; For he who preaches the
Gospel with an eye to this, that he may have whereof he may eat and
whereof be clothed, accounts that he at the same time both serves
God, because he preaches the Gospel; and mammon, because he
preaches with an eye to these necessaries: which thing the Lord
saith to be impossible. And hereby he who doth for the sake of
these things preach the Gospel is convicted that he serves not God
but mammon; however God may use him, he knows not how, to other
men&#8217;s advancement. For to this sentence doth He subjoin, saying
&#8220;Therefore I say unto you, Be not solicitous for your life what
ye shall eat, nor for your body what ye shall put on:&#8221; not that
they should not procure these things, as much as is enough for
necessity, by what means they honestly may; but that they should
not look to these things, and for the sake of these do whatever in
preaching of the Gospel they are bidden to do. The intention,

that is, such will be thy deeds as shall be thine intention for
which thou doest them. For indeed that He might come to this, He
had before given precept concerning alms, saying, &#8220;Lay not up for
yourselves treasures on earth where rust and moth doth corrupt, and
where thieves break through and steal. But lay up for yourselves
treasure in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and

concerning birds of the air and lilies of the field, He saith to
this end, that no man may think that God careth not for the needs

is not He that feeds and clothes them also which work with their

unto their purpose of getting these things, the Lord in this

kingdom and righteousness: and all these things shall be added unto
us, whether working by our hands, or whether by infirmity of body
hindered from working, or whether bound by such occupation of our

question, why they did not rather stand, and by calling upon God
obtain through His marvellous works in such wise deliverance, as
Daniel from the lions, as Peter from his chains, they would answer
that they ought not to tempt God, but He would then and then only
do the like for them, if it should please Him, when they had
nothing that they could do; but when He put flight in their power,
although they were thereby delivered, yet were they not delivered
but by Him: so likewise to servants of God having time and strength
after the example and precept of the Apostle to get their living by
their own hands, if any from the Gospel shall raise a question
concerning the birds of the air, which sow not nor reap nor gather
into stores, and concerning lilies of the field that they toil not
neither do they spin; they will easily answer, &#8220;If we also, by
reason of any either infirmity or occupation cannot work, He will
so feed and clothe us, as He doth the birds and the lilies, which
do no work of this kind: <pb n="521" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_521.html" id="v.vii.xxxvi-Page_521"/>but when we are able, we ought
not to tempt our God; because this very ability of ours, we have it
by His gift, and in living by it, we live by His bounty Who hath
bounteously bestowed upon us that we should have this ability. And
therefore concerning these necessary things we are not solicitous;
because when we are able to do these things, He by Whom mankind are
fed and clothed doth feed and clothe us: but when we are not able
to do these things, He feeds and clothes us by Whom the birds are
fed and the lilies clothed, because we are more worth than they.
Wherefore in this our warfare, neither for the morrow take we
thought: because not for the sake of these temporal things,
whereunto pertaineth To-morrow, but for the sake of those eternal
things, where it is evermore To-day, have we proved ourselves unto
Him, that, entangled in no secular business, we may please Him.<note place="end" n="2591" id="v.vii.xxxvi-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.xxxvi-p6"> <scripRef passage="2 Tim. ii. 4" id="v.vii.xxxvi-p6.2" parsed="|2Tim|2|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Tim.2.4">2 Tim. ii. 4</scripRef></p></note></p>

having their stated abode in the different places, not those who
were running hither and hither on the business of the Gospel, were

affairs. Whence it is no where written of him that he on any
occasion gave up his time to such matters; from which we are not
able to excuse ourselves, even though we be contemptible; because
he willed even such to be put in place, in case there were lack of
wise men, rather than have the affairs of Christians to be brought
into the public courts. Which labor, however, we not without
consolation of the Lord take upon us, for hope of eternal life,
that we may bring forth fruit with patience. For we are servants
unto His Church, and most of all to the weaker members, whatsoever
members we in the same body may chance to be. I pass by other
innumerable ecclesiastical cares, which perchance no man credits
but he who hath experienced the same. Therefore we do not bind
heavy burdens and place them on your shoulders, while we ourselves
touch them not so much as with a finger; since indeed if with
safety to our office we might, (He seeth it, Who tries our hearts!)
we would rather do these things which we exhort you to do, than the
things which we ourselves are forced to do. True it is, to all both
us and you, while according to our degree and office we labor, both
the way is strait in labor and toil; and yet, while we rejoice in
hope, His yoke is easy and His burden light, Who hath called us

not Himself either was without pressure of griefs. If ye be our

of respect for certain long-haired brethren, in whom, except this,

we love them in Christ, the more solicitously do we admonish them.
Nor are we afraid indeed, lest their humility reject our

they, wherever we chance to stumble or to go aside. This then we
admonish so holy men, not to be moved by foolish quibblings of vain

renewal of mind in which is the image of God? Who would say this?
But in the sex of their body they do not signify this; therefore
they are bidden to be veiled. The part, namely, which they signify
in the very fact of their being women, is that which may be called
the concupiscential part, over which the mind<note place="end" n="2624" id="v.vii.xli-p9.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.vii.xli-p10"> <i>Mens</i></p></note> bears rule, itself also subjected

therefore, in a single individual human being is the mind and the

the same in two human beings, man and woman, is in regard of the

Apostle speaks when he says, that the man ought not to be veiled,

higher things, the more diligently the concupiscence is curbed from
lower things; until the whole man together with even this now

41. Wherefore, they which
will not do right things, let them give over at least to teach
wrong things. Howbeit they be others whom in this speech we
reprove: but as for those who by this one fault, of letting their
hair contrary to apostolic precept grow long, offend and trouble
the Church, because when some being unwilling to think of them any
thing amiss are forced to twist the manifest words of the Apostle
into a wrong meaning, others choose to defend the sound
understanding of the Scriptures rather than fawn upon any men,
there arise between the weaker and the stronger brethren most
bitter and perilous contentions: which things perchance if they
knew, these would correct without hesitation this also, in whom we
admire and love all else. Those then we not reprove, but ask and
solemnly beseech by the Godhead and the Manhood of Christ and by
the charity of the Holy Ghost, that they no more put this
stumbling-block before the weak for whom Christ died, and aggravate
the grief and torment of our heart when we bethink us how much more
readily evil men can imitate this evil thing for deceiving of
mankind, when they see this in them whom on the score of other so
great good we with deserved offices of Christian love do honor. If
however, after this admonition, or rather this solemn entreaty of
ours, they shall think fit to persevere in the same, we shall do
nothing else but only grieve and mourn. This let them know; it is
enough. If they be servants of God, they have pity. If they have
not pity, I will not say any thing worse. All these things,
therefore, in the which peradventure I have been more loquacious
than the occupations both of thee and of me could wish, if thou
approve the same, make thou to be known to our brethren and sons,
on whose behalf thou hast deigned to put this burden upon me: but
if aught seem to thee meet to be withdrawn or amended, by reply of
your Blessedness I shall know the same.</p>

Erasmus infers from the style
and language of this piece, that it is not S. Augustin&#8217;s, putting
it in the same category with the treatises <i>On Continence, On
substance of Charity, On Faith of things invisible.</i> The
Benedictine editors acknowledge that it has peculiarities of style
which are calculated to move suspicion; (especially the studied
assonances and rhyming endings, e.g. &#8220;<i>cautior fuit iste in
doloribus quam ille in nemoribus . . . consensit ille
oblectamentis, non cessit ille tormentis</i>,&#8221; chap. 12.); yet
they feel themselves bound to retain it among the genuine works by
Augustin&#8217;s own testimony, who mentions both this piece and that
<i>On Continence</i> in his Epistle to Darius, 231. chap. 7. [Vol.
I. 584.] That it is not named in the <i>Retractations</i> is
accounted for by the circumstance that it appears to have been
delivered as a sermon, see chap. 1. and 3, and Augustin did not
live to fulfill his intention of composing a further book of
retractations on review of his popular discourses and letters. <i>

1. <span class="c19" id="v.viii.ii-p1.1">
That</span> virtue of the mind which is called Patience, is so
great a gift of God, that even in Him who bestoweth the same upon
us, that, whereby He waiteth for evil men that they may amend, is
set forth by the name of Patience, [or long-suffering.] So,
although in God there can be no suffering,<note place="end" n="2627" id="v.viii.ii-p1.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii.ii-p2"> <i>Pati</i></p></note> and &#8220;patience&#8221; hath its name
<i>a patiendo</i>, from suffering, yet a patient God we not only
faithfully believe, but also wholesomely confess. But the patience
of God, of what kind and how great it is, His, Whom we say to be
impassible,<note place="end" n="2628" id="v.viii.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii.ii-p3"> <i>Nihil
patientem</i></p></note> yet not
impatient, nay even most patient, in words to unfold this who can
be able? Ineffable is therefore that patience, as is His jealousy,
as His wrath, and whatever there is like to these. For if we
conceive of these as they be in us, in Him are there none. We,
namely, can feel none of these without molestation: but be it far
from us to surmise that the impassible nature of God is liable to
any molestation. But like as He is jealous without any darkening of
spirit,<note place="end" n="2629" id="v.viii.ii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii.ii-p4"> <i>Livore</i></p></note> wroth
without any perturbation, pitiful without any pain, repenteth Him
without any wrongness in Him to be set right; so is He patient
without aught of passion. Now therefore as concerning human
patience, which we are able to conceive and beholden to have, of
what sort it is, I will, as God granteth and the brevity of the
present discourse alloweth, essay to set forth.</p>

2. The patience of man, which
is right and laudable and worthy of the name of virtue, is
understood to be that by which we tolerate evil things with an even
mind, that we may not with a mind uneven desert good things,
through which we may arrive at better. Wherefore the impatient,
while they will not suffer ills, effect not a deliverance from
ills, but only the suffering of heavier ills. Whereas the patient
who choose rather by not committing to bear, than by not
bearing <pb n="528" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_528.html" id="v.viii.iii-Page_528"/>to commit, evil, both make lighter what through patience
they suffer, and also escape worse ills in which through impatience
they would be sunk. But those good things which are great and
eternal they lose not, while to the evils which be temporal and
brief they yield not: because &#8220;the sufferings of this present
time are not worthy to be compared,&#8221; as the Apostle says, &#8220;with
the future glory that shall be revealed in us.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2630" id="v.viii.iii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii.iii-p2"> <scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 18" id="v.viii.iii-p2.2" parsed="|Rom|8|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.18">Rom. viii. 18</scripRef></p></note> And again

3. Look we then, beloved, what
hardships in labors and sorrows men endure, for things which they
viciously love, and by how much they think to be made by them more
happy, by so much more unhappily covet. How much for false riches,
how much for vain honors, how much for affections of games and
shows, is of exceeding peril and trouble most patiently borne! We
see men hankering after money, glory, lasciviousness, how, that
they may arrive at their desires, and having gotten not lose them,
they endure sun, rain, icy cold, waves, and most stormy tempests,
the roughnesses and uncertainties of wars, the strokes of huge
blows, and dreadful wounds, not of inevitable necessity but of
culpable will. But these madnesses are thought, in a manner,
permitted. Thus avarice, ambition, luxury, and the delights of all
sorts of games and shows, unless for them some wicked deed be
committed or outrage which is prohibited by human laws, are
accounted to pertain to innocence: nay moreover, the man who
without wrong to any shall, whether for getting or increasing of
money, whether for obtaining or keeping of honors, whether in
contending in the match, or in hunting, or in exhibiting with
applause some theatrical spectacle, have borne great labors and
pains, it is not enough that through popular vanity he is checked
by no reproofs, but he is moreover extolled with praises:
&#8220;Because,&#8221; as it is written, &#8220;the sinner is praised in the
desires of his soul.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2632" id="v.viii.iv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii.iv-p2"> <scripRef passage="Ps. x. 3" id="v.viii.iv-p2.2" parsed="|Ps|10|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.10.3">Ps. x. 3</scripRef></p></note> For the force of desires makes
endurance of labors and pains: and no man save for that which he
enjoyeth, freely takes on him to bear that which annoyeth. But
these lusts, as I said, for the fulfilling of which they which are
on fire with them most patiently endure much hardship and
bitterness, are accounted to be permitted, and allowed by
laws.</p>

4. Nay more; for is it not so
that even for open wickednesses, not to punish but to perpetrate
them, men put up with many most grievous troubles? Do not authors
of secular letters tell of a certain right noble parricide of his
country, that hunger, thirst, cold, all these he was able to
endure, and his body was patient of lack of food and warmth and
sleep to a degree surpassing belief?<note place="end" n="2633" id="v.viii.v-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii.v-p2"> <i>Sallust

of whom while they lie in wait for travellers endure whole nights
without sleep, and that they may catch, as they pass by, men who
have no thought of harm, will, no matter how foul the weather,
plant in one spot their mind and body, which are full of thoughts
of harm? Nay it is said that some of them are wont to torture one
another by turns, to that degree that this practice and training
against pains is not a whit short of pains. For, not so much
perchance are they excruciated by the Judge, that through smart of
pain the truth may be got at, as they are by their own comrades,
that through patience of pain truth may not be betrayed. And yet in
all these the patience is rather to be wondered at than praised:
nay neither wondered at nor praised, seeing it is no patience; but
we must wonder at the hardness, deny the patience: for there is
nothing in this rightly to be praised, nothing usefully to be
imitated; and thou wilt rightly judge the mind to be all the more
worthy of greater punishment, the more it yields up to vices the
instruments of virtues. Patience is companion of wisdom, not
handmaid of concupiscence: patience is the friend of a good
conscience, not the foe of innocence.</p>

5. When therefore thou shall
see any man suffer aught patiently, do not straightway praise it as
patience; for this is only shown by the cause of suffering. When it
is a good cause, then is it true patience: when that is not
polluted by lust, then is this distinguished from falsity. But when
that is placed in crime, then is this much misplaced in name. For
not just as all who know are partakers of knowledge, just so are
all who suffer partakers of patience: but they which rightly use
the suffering, these in verity of patience are praised, these with
the prize of patience are crowned.</p>

6. But yet, seeing that for

this temporal life and weal men do wonderfully bear the brunt of
many horrible sufferings, they much admonish us how great things
ought to be borne for the sake of a good life, that it may also
hereafter be eternal life, and without any bound of time, without
waste or loss of any advantage, in true felicity secure. The Lord
saith, &#8220;In your patience ye shall <pb n="529" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_529.html" id="v.viii.vii-Page_529"/>possess your souls:&#8221;<note place="end" n="2634" id="v.viii.vii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii.vii-p2"> <scripRef passage="Luke xxi. 19" id="v.viii.vii-p2.2" parsed="|Luke|21|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.21.19">Luke xxi. 19</scripRef></p></note> He saith
not, your farms, your praises, your luxuries; but, &#8220;your

possess that whereby it may be lost, how great ought it to bear
that it may not be lost? And then, to mention a thing not culpable,
if it bear so great sufferings for saving of the flesh under the
hands of chirurgeons cutting or burning the same, how great ought
it to bear for saving of itself under the fury of any soever
enemies? Seeing that leeches, that the body may not die, do by
pains consult for the body&#8217;s good; but enemies by threatening the
body with pains and death, would urge us on to the slaying of soul
and body in hell.</p>

7. Though indeed the welfare
even of the body is then more providently consulted for if its
temporal life and welfare be disregarded for righteousness&#8217; sake,
and its pain or death most patiently for righteousness&#8217; sake
endured. Since it is of the body&#8217;s redemption which is to be in
the end, that the Apostle speaks, where he says, &#8220;Even we
ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting the adoption of sons, the

are we saved. But hope which is seen is not hope: for what a man
seeth, why doth he also hope for? But if what we see not we hope
for, we do by patience wait for it.&#8221; When therefore any ills do
torture us indeed, yet not extort from us ill works, not only is
the soul possessed through patience; but even when through patience
the body itself for a time is afflicted or lost, it is unto eternal
stability and salvation resumed, and hath through grief and death
an inviolable health and happy immortality laid up for itself.

8. But although patience be a
virtue of the mind, yet partly the mind exercises it in the mind
itself, partly in the body. In itself it exercises patience, when,
the body remaining unhurt and untouched, the mind is goaded by any
adversities or filthinesses of things or words, to do or to say
something that is not expedient or not becoming, and patiently
bears all evils that it may not itself commit any evil in work or
word. By this patience we bear, even while we be sound in body,
that in the midst of the offenses of this world our blessedness is
deferred: of which is said what I cited a little before, &#8220;If what
we see not we hope for, we do by patience wait for it.&#8221; By this
patience, holy David bore the revilings of a railer,<note place="end" n="2638" id="v.viii.ix-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii.ix-p2"> <scripRef passage="2 Sam. xvi. 5-12" id="v.viii.ix-p2.2" parsed="|2Sam|16|5|16|12" osisRef="Bible:2Sam.16.5-2Sam.16.12">2 Sam. xvi. 5&#8211;12</scripRef></p></note> and, when
he might easily have avenged himself, not only did it not, but even
refrained another who was vexed and moved for him; and more put
forth his kingly power by prohibiting than by exercising vengeance.
Nor at that time was his body afflicted with any disease or wound,
but there was an acknowledging of a time of humility, and a bearing
of the will of God, for the sake of which there was a drinking of
the bitterness of contumely with most patient mind. This patience
the Lord taught, when, the servants being moved at the mixing in of
the tares and wishing to gather them up, He said that the
householder answered, &#8220;Leave both to grow until the harvest.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2639" id="v.viii.ix-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii.ix-p3"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 13.30" id="v.viii.ix-p3.1" parsed="|Matt|13|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.30">Matt. xiii. 30</scripRef></p></note> That,
namely, must be patience put up with, which must not be in haste

be, which it were tedious to rehearse, belong to that manner of
patience, by which the mind doth, not its own sins but any evils so
ever from without, patiently endure in itself, while the body
remains altogether unhurt. But the other manner of patience is that
by which the same mind bears any troubles and grievances whatsoever
in the sufferings of the body; not as do foolish or wicked men for
the sake of getting vain things or perpetrating crimes; but as is
defined by the Lord, &#8220;for righteousness&#8217; sake.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2642" id="v.viii.ix-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="v.viii.ix-p6"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 5.10" id="v.viii.ix-p6.1" parsed="|Matt|5|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.10">Matt. v. 10</scripRef></p></note> In both

these unbroken: and in their bodies they were bound, imprisoned,
vexed with hunger and thirst, tortured, gashed, torn asunder,
burned, butchered; and with piety immovable submitted unto

9. It is indeed a greater
fight of patience, when it is not a visible enemy that by
persecution and rage would urge us into crime which enemy may
openly and in broad day be by not consenting overcome; but the
devil himself, (he who doth likewise by means of the children of
infidelity, as by his vessels, persecute the children of light)
doth by himself hiddenly attack us, by his rage putting us on to do
or say something against God. As such had holy Job experience of
him, by both temptations vexed, but in both through steadfast
strength of patience and arms of piety unconquered. For first, his
body being left unhurt, he lost all that he had, in order that the
mind, before excruciation of the flesh, might through withdrawal of
the things which men are wont to prize highly, be broken, and he
might say something against God upon loss of the things for the
sake of which he was thought to worship Him. He was smitten also
with sudden bereavement of all his sons so that whom he had
begotten one by one he should lose all at once, as though their
numerousness had been not for the adorning of his felicity, but for
the increasing of his calamity. But where, having endured these
things, he remained immovable in his God, he cleaved to His will,
Whom it was not possible to lose but by his own will; and in place
of the things he had lost he held Him who took them away, in Whom
he should find what should never be lost. For He that took them
away was not that enemy who had will of hurting, but He who had
given to that enemy the power of hurting. The enemy next attacked
also the body, and now not those things which were in the man from
without, but the man himself, in whatever part he could, he smote.
From the head to the feet were burning pains, were crawling worms,
were running sores; still in the rotting body the mind remained
entire, and horrid as were the tortures of the consuming flesh,
with inviolate piety and uncorrupted patience it endured them all.
There stood the wife, and instead of giving her husband any help,
was suggesting blasphemy against God. For we are not to think that
the devil, in leaving her when he took away the sons, went to work
as one unskilled in mischief: rather, how necessary she was to the
tempter, he had already learned in Eve. But now he had not found a
second Adam whom he might take by means of a woman. More cautious
was Job in his hours of sadness, than Adam in his bowers of
gladness, the one was overcome in the midst of pleasant things, the
other overcame in the midst of pains; the one consented to that
which seemed delightsome, this other quailed not in torments most
affrightsome. There stood his friends too, not to console him in
his evils, but to suspect evil in him. For while he suffered so
great sorrows, they believed him not innocent, nor did their tongue
forbear to say that which his conscience had not to say; that so
amid ruthless tortures of the body, his mind also might be beaten
with truthless reproaches. But he, bearing in his flesh his own
pains, in his heart others&#8217; errors, reproved his wife for her
folly, taught his friends wisdom, preserved patience in each and
all.</p>

put themselves to death when they are sought for to have life put
upon them; and by bereaving themselves of the present, deny and
refuse also that which is to come. Why, if people were driving them
to deny Christ or to do any thing contrary to righteousness, like
true Martyrs, they ought rather to bear all patiently than to dare
death impatiently. If it could be right to do this for the sake of
running away from evils, holy Job would have killed himself, that
being in so great evils, in his estate, in his sons, in his limbs,
through the devil&#8217;s cruelty, he might escape them all. But he did
it not. Far be it from him, a wise man, to commit upon himself what
not even that unwise woman suggested. And if she had suggested it,
she would with good reason here also have had that answer which she
had when suggesting blasphemy; &#8220;Thou hast spoken as one of the
foolish women. If we have received good at the hand of the Lord,

lost patience, if either by blasphemy as she had suggested, or by

pains, if after the death of his body he should be hurried off to
punishment either of blasphemers, or of murderers, or of them which
are worse even than parricides. For if a parricide be on that
account more wicked than any homicide, because he kills not merely
a man but a near relative; and among parricides too, the nearer the
person killed, the greater criminal he is judged to be: without
doubt worse still is he who kills himself, because there is none
nearer to a man than himself. What then do these miserable persons

from holy Scripture the precepts of patience: &#8220;My son, when thou

bear up; that in the last end thy life may increase. All that shall

is more eager of lust, and bearing ills with the more endurance the
worse itself becometh: while to this, which is true patience, the
human will, unless aided and inflamed from above, doth not suffice,
for the very reason that the Holy Spirit is the fire thereof; by
Whom unless it be kindled to love that impassible Good, it is not
able to bear the ill which it suffereth.</p>

and inflamed with deceitful visions and unclean incentives by the
devilish spirit, associated and conspiring therewith in malignant
agreement, this spirit makes the will of the man either frantic
with error, or burning with appetite of some worldly delight; and
hence, it seems to show a marvellous endurance of intolerable
evils: but yet it does not follow from this that an evil will
without instigation of another and unclean spirit, like as a good
will without aid of the Holy Spirit, cannot exist. For that there
may be an evil will even without any spirit either seducing or
inciting, is sufficiently clear in the instance of the devil
himself, who is found to have become a devil, not through some
other devil, but of his own proper will. An evil will therefore,
whether it be hurried on by lust, whether called back by fear,
whether expanded by gladness, whether contracted by sadness, and in
all these perturbations of mind enduring and making light of
whatever are to others, or at another time, more grievous, this
evil will may, without another spirit to goad it on, seduce itself,
and in lapsing by defection from the higher to the lower, the more
pleasant it shall account that thing to be which it seeks to get or
fears to lose, or rejoices to have gotten, or grieves to have lost,
the more tolerably for its sake bear what is less for it to suffer
than that is to be enjoyed. For whatever that thing be, it is of

patience of the poor of Christ (who yet are to be made rich as

we shall be commanded patiently to bear, but because for that which
we have here patiently borne, we shall enjoy eternal bliss. He will

bestowed as a gift upon charity, Whose gift that charity is

1. Long time, my venerable
fellow-bishop Paulinus, have I been thy Holiness&#8217;s debtor for an
answer; even since thou wrotest to me by them of the household<note place="end" n="2708" id="v.ix.ii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.ii-p2"> <i>Homines</i></p></note> of our
most religious daughter Flora, asking of me whether it profit any
man after death that his body is buried at the memorial of some
Saint. This, namely, had the said widow begged of thee for her son
deceased in those parts, and thou hadst written her an answer,
consoling her, and announcing to her concerning the body of the
faithful young man Cynegius, that the thing which she with motherly
and pious affection desired was done, to wit, by placing it in the
basilica of most blessed Felix the Confessor. Upon which occasion
it came to pass, that by the same bearers of thy letter thou didst
write also to me, raising the like question, and craving that I
would answer what I thought of this matter, at the same time not
forbearing to say what are thine own sentiments. For thou sayest
that to thy thinking these be no empty motions of religious and
faithful minds, which take this care for their deceased friends.
Thou addest, moreover, that it cannot be void of effect<note place="end" n="2709" id="v.ix.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.ii-p3"> <i>Vacare</i></p></note> that the
whole Church is wont to supplicate for the departed: so that hence
it may be further conjectured that it doth profit a person after
death, if by the faith of his friends for the interment of his body
such a spot be provided wherein may be apparent the aid, likewise
in this way sought, of the Saints.</p>

2. But this being the case,
how to this opinion that should not be contrary which the Apostle
says, &#8220;For we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ,
that each may receive according to the things he hath done by the
body,<note place="end" n="2710" id="v.ix.iii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.iii-p2"> <i>Per corpus</i></p></note> whether
good or bad;&#8221;<note place="end" n="2711" id="v.ix.iii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.iii-p3"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. v. 10" id="v.ix.iii-p3.2" parsed="|2Cor|5|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.10">2 Cor. v. 10</scripRef></p></note> this, thou
signifiest, thou dost not well see. For this apostolic sentence
doth before death admonish to be done, that which may profit after
death; not then, first, when there is to be now a receiving of that
which a person shall have done before death. True, but this
question is thus solved, namely, that there is a certain kind of
life by which is acquired, while one lives in this body, that it
should be possible for these things to be of some help to the
departed; and, consequently, it is &#8220;according to the things done
by the body,&#8221; that they are aided by the things which shall,
after they have left the body, be religiously done on their behalf.
For there are whom these things aid nothing at all, namely,
when <pb n="540" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_540.html" id="v.ix.iii-Page_540"/>they are done either for persons whose merits are so
evil, that neither by such things are they worthy to be aided; or
for persons whose merits are so good, that of such things they have
no need as aids. Of the kind of life, therefore, which each hath
led by the body, doth it come, that these things profit or profit
not, whatever are piously done on his behalf when he has left the
body. For touching merit whereby these things profit, if none have
been gotten in this life, it is in vain sought after this life. So
it comes to pass as well that not unmeaningly<note place="end" n="2712" id="v.ix.iii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.iii-p4"> <i>Inaniter</i></p></note> doth the Church, or care of
friends, bestow upon the departed whatever of religion it shall be
able; as also that, nevertheless, each receiveth &#8220;according to
the things which he hath done by the body, whether it be good or
bad,&#8221; the Lord rendering unto each according to his works. For,
that this which is bestowed should be capable of profiting him
after the body, this was acquired in that life which he hath led in
the body.</p>

3. Possibly thy inquiry is
satisfied by this my brief reply. But what other considerations
move me, to which I think meet to answer, do thou for a short space
attend. In the books of the Maccabees we read of sacrifice offered
for the dead.<note place="end" n="2713" id="v.ix.iv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.iv-p2"> <scripRef passage="2 Mac. xii. 43" id="v.ix.iv-p2.2" parsed="|2Macc|12|43|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Macc.12.43">2 Mac. xii. 43</scripRef></p></note> Howbeit
even if it were no where at all read in the Old Scriptures, not
small is the authority, which in this usage is clear, of the whole
Church, namely, that in the prayers of the priest which are offered
to the Lord God at His altar, the Commendation of the dead hath
also its place. But then, whether there be some profit accruing
unto the soul of the dead from the place of its body, requires a
more careful inquiry. And first, whether it make any difference in
causing or increasing of misery after this life to the spirits of
men if their bodies be not buried, this must be looked into, not in
the light of opinion however commonly received, but rather of the
holy writ of our religion. For we are not to credit that, as is
read in Maro, the unburied are prohibited from navigating and
crossing the infernal stream: because forsooth</p>

come to the succor of His own. To whom when it is answered that the
souls of the faithful were, according to the merits of their faith,

choose to do with the bodies of the slain. Unless haply any is so
absurd as to contend that they ought not to be feared before death,
lest they kill the body, but ought to be feared after death, lest,
having killed the body, they suffer it not to be buried. Is that
then false which Christ says, &#8220;Who kill the body, and afterwards
have no more that they can do,&#8221; if they have so great things that
they can do on dead bodies? Far be the thought, that that should be
false which Truth hath said. For the thing said is, that they do
somewhat when they kill, because in the body there is feeling while
it is in killing, but afterward they have nothing more that they
can do because there is no feeling in the body when killed. Many
bodies, then, of Christians the earth hath not covered: but none of
them hath any separated from heaven and earth, the whole of which
He filleth with presence of Himself, Who knoweth whence to
resuscitate that which He created. It is said indeed in the Psalm,
&#8220;The dead bodies of thy servants have they given for meat unto

5. Yet it follows not that the
bodies of the departed are to be despised and flung aside, and
above all of just and faithful men, which bodies as organs and
vessels to all good works their spirit hath holily used. For if a
father&#8217;s garment and ring, and whatever such like, is the more
dear to those whom they leave behind, the greater their affection
is towards their parents, in no wise are the bodies themselves to
be spurned, which truly we wear in more familiar and close
conjunction than any of our putting on. For these pertain not to
ornament or aid which is applied from without, but to the very
nature of man. Whence also the funerals of the just men of old were

put us upon thinking that there is in dead bodies any feeling; but
rather, that the Providence of God (Who is moreover pleased with

the dead, this they betoken, to the intent our faith of
resurrection might be stayed up thereby. Where also is wholesomely
learned, how great may be the reward for alms which we do unto the
living and feeling, if not even that be lost before God, whatever
of duty and of diligence is paid to the lifeless members of men.
There are indeed also other things, which in speaking of the
bestowal or removal of their bodies the holy Patriarchs willed to
be understood as spoken by the prophetic Spirit: but this is not
the place to treat thoroughly of these things, seeing that
sufficeth which we have said. But if the lack of those things which
are necessary for sustentation of the living, as food and clothing,
however heavy affliction attend the lacking, do not break in good
men the manly courage of bearing and enduring, nor eradicate piety
from the mind, but by exercising make it more fruitful; how much
more doth lack of those things which are wont to be applied for
care of funerals and bestowal of bodies of the departed, not make
them wretched, now that in the hidden abodes of the pious they are
at rest! And therefore, when these things have to dead bodies of
Christians in that devastation of the great City or of other towns
also been lacking, there is neither fault of the living, who could
not afford these things, nor pain of the dead who could not feel
the same.<note place="end" n="2725" id="v.ix.vi-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.vi-p6"> <i>On the City of

6. If this be true, doubtless
also the providing for the interment of bodies a place at
<pb n="542" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_542.html" id="v.ix.vii-Page_542"/>the
Memorials of Saints, is a mark of a good human affection towards
the remains of one&#8217;s friends: since if there be religion in the
burying, there cannot but be religion in taking thought where the
burying shall be. But while it is desirable there should be such
like solaces of survivors, for the showing forth of their pious
mind towards their beloved, I do not see what helps they be to the
dead save in this way: that upon recollection of the place in which
are deposited the bodies of those whom they love, they should by
prayer commend them to those same Saints, who have as patrons taken
them into their charge to aid them before the Lord. Which indeed
they would be still able to do, even though they were not able to
inter them in such places. But then the only reason why the name
Memorials or Monuments is given to those sepulchres of the dead
which become specially distinguished, is that they recall to
memory, and by putting in mind cause us to think of, them who by
death are withdrawn from the eyes of the living, that they may not
by forgetfulness be also withdrawn from men&#8217;s hearts. For both
the term Memorial<note place="end" n="2726" id="v.ix.vii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.vii-p2"> <i>Memoria</i></p></note> most plainly shews this, and
Monument is so named from monishing, that is, putting in mind. For
which reason the Greeks also call that <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ix.vii-p2.1">&#956;&#957;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</span> which we
call a Memorial or Monument: because in their tongue the memory
itself, by which we remember, is called <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="v.ix.vii-p2.2">&#956;&#957;&#8053;&#956;&#951;</span>. When
therefore the mind recollects where the body of a very dear friend
lies buried, and thereupon there occurs to the thoughts a place
rendered venerable by the name of a Martyr, to that same Martyr
doth it commend the soul in affection of heartfelt recollection<note place="end" n="2727" id="v.ix.vii-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.vii-p3"> <i>Recordationis</i></p></note> and
prayer. And when this affection is exhibited to the departed by
faithful men who were most dear to them, there is no doubt that it
profits them who while living in the body merited that such things
should profit them after this life. But even if some necessity
should through absence of all facility not allow bodies to be
interred, or in such places interred, yet should there be no
pretermitting of supplications for the spirits of the dead: which
supplications, that they should be made for all in Christian and
catholic fellowship departed, even without mentioning of their
names, under a general commemoration, the Church hath charged
herself withal; to the intent that they which lack, for these
offices, parents or sons or whatever kindred or friends, may have
the same afforded unto them by the one pious mother which is common
to all. But if there were lack of these supplications, which are
made with right faith and piety for the dead, I account that it
should not a whit profit their spirits, howsoever in holy places
the lifeless bodies should be deposited.</p>

7. When therefore the faithful
mother of a faithful son departed desired to have his body
deposited in the basilica of a Martyr, forasmuch as she believed
that his soul would be aided by the merits of the Martyr, the very
believing of this was a sort of supplication, and this profited, if
aught profited. And in that she recurs in her thoughts to this same
sepulchre, and in her prayers more and more commends her son, the
spirit of the departed is aided, not by the place of its dead body,
but by that which springs from memory of the place, the living
affection of the mother. For at once the thought, who is commended
and to whom, doth touch, and that with no unprofitable emotion, the
religious mind of her who prays. For also in prayer to God,<note place="end" n="2728" id="v.ix.viii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.viii-p2"> <i>Orantes</i></p></note> men do
with the members of their bodies that which becometh suppliants,
when they bend their knees, when they stretch forth their hands, or
even prostrate themselves on the ground, and whatever else they
visibly do, albeit their invisible will and heart&#8217;s intention be
known unto God, and He needs not these tokens that any man&#8217;s mind
should be opened unto Him: only hereby one more excites himself to
pray and groan more humbly and more fervently. And I know not how
it is, that, while these motions of the body cannot be made but by
a motion of the mind preceding, yet by the same being outwardly in
visible sort made, that inward invisible one which made them is
increased: and thereby the heart&#8217;s affection which preceded that
they might be made, groweth because they are made. But still if any
be in that way held, or even bound, that he is not able to do these
things with his limbs, it does not follow that the inner man does
not pray, and before the eyes of God in its most secret chamber,
where it hath compunction, cast itself on the ground. So likewise,
while it makes very much difference, where a person deposits the
body of his dead, while he supplicates for his spirit unto God,
because both the affection preceding chose a spot which was holy,
and after the body is there deposited the recalling to mind of that
holy spot renews and increases the affection which had preceded;
yet, though he may not be able in that place which his religious
mind did choose to lay in the ground him whom he loves, in no wise
ought he to cease from <pb n="543" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_543.html" id="v.ix.viii-Page_543"/>necessary supplications in
commending of the same. For wheresoever the flesh of the departed
may lie or not lie, the spirit requires rest and must get it: for
the spirit in its departing from thence took with it the
consciousness without which it could make no odds how one exists,
whether in a good estate or a bad: and it does not look for aiding
of its life from that flesh to which it did itself afford the life
which it withdrew in its departing, and is to render back in its
returning; since not flesh to spirit, but spirit unto flesh
procureth merit even of very resurrection, whether it be unto
punishment or unto glory that it is to come to life
again.</p>

prophet threatening another prophet who had transgressed His word,
that his carcase should not be brought into the sepulchre of his
fathers. Which the Scripture hath on this wise: &#8220;Thus saith the
Lord, Because thou hast been disobedient to the mouth of the Lord,
and hast not kept the charge which the Lord thy God commanded thee,
and hast returned and eaten bread and drunk water in the place in

considering what account is to be made of this punishment, we go by
the Gospel, where we have learned that after the slaying of the
body there is no cause to fear lest the lifeless members should
suffer any thing, it is not even to be called a punishment. But if
we consider a man&#8217;s human affection towards his own flesh, it was
possible for him to be frightened or saddened, while living, by
that of which he would have no sense when dead: and this was a
punishment, because the mind was pained by that thing about to
happen to its body, howsoever when it did happen it would feel no
pain. To this intent, namely, it pleased the Lord to punish His
servant, who not of his own contumacy had spurned to fulfill His
command, but by deceit of another&#8217;s falsehood thought himself to
be obeying when he obeyed not. For it is not to be thought that he
was killed by the teeth of the beast as one whose soul should be
thence snatched away to the torments of hell: seeing that over his
very body the same lion which had killed it did keep watch, while
moreover the beast on which he rode was left unhurt, and along with
that fierce beast did with intrepid presence stand there beside his
master&#8217;s corpse. By which marvellous sign it appeareth, that the
man of God was, say rather, checked temporally even unto death,
than punished after death. Of which matter, the Apostle when on
account of certain offenses he had mentioned the sicknesses and
deaths of many, says, &#8220;For if we would judge ourselves, we should
not be judged of the Lord. But when we are judged we are chastened
of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2733" id="v.ix.x-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.x-p4"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 31, 32" id="v.ix.x-p4.2" parsed="|1Cor|11|31|11|32" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.31-1Cor.11.32">1 Cor. xi. 31, 32</scripRef>. [See

Josiah king of Judah did in that land disinter the bones of many
dead, and with the same bones defile the sacrilegious altars which
had been set up for the graven images. For he spared that tomb in
which lay the prophet who more than three hundred years before
predicted those things, and for his sake neither was the sepulture
of him who had seduced him violated. By that affection namely,
which causes that no man ever hateth his own flesh, this man had
taken forethought for his carcase, who had slain with a lie his own
soul. By reason then of this, the natural love which every man hath
for his own flesh, it was both to the one a punishment to learn
that he should not be in the sepulchre of his fathers, and to the
other a care to take order beforehand that his own bones should be
spared, if he should lie beside him whose sepulchre no man should

10. This affection the
Martyrs of Christ contending for the truth did overcome: and it is
no marvel that they despised that whereof they should, when death
was overpast, have no feeling, when they could not by those
tortures, which while alive they did feel, be overcome. God was
able, no doubt, (even as He permitted not the lion when it had
slain the Prophet, to touch his body further, and of a slayer made
it to be a keeper): He was able, I say, to have kept the slain
bodies of His own from the dogs to which they had been flung; He
was able in innumerable ways to have deterred the rage of the men
themselves, that to burn the carcases, to scatter the ashes, they
should not dare: but it was fit that this experience also should
not be lacking to manifold variety of temptations, lest the
fortitude of confession which would not for the saving of the life
of the body give way to the savageness of persecution, should be
tremblingly anxious for the honor of a sepulchre: in a word, lest
faith of resurrection should dread the consuming of the body. It
was fit then, that even these things should be permitted, in order
that, even after these examples of so great horror, the Martyrs,
fervent in confession of Christ, should become witnesses of this
truth also, in which they had learned that they by whom their
bodies should be slain had after that no more that they could do.<note place="end" n="2734" id="v.ix.xi-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.xi-p2"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 10.28" id="v.ix.xi-p2.1" parsed="|Matt|10|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.28">Matt. x. 28</scripRef></p></note> Because,
whatever they should do to dead bodies, they would after all do
nothing, seeing that in flesh devoid of all life, neither was it
possible for him to feel aught who had thence departed, nor for Him
to lose aught thereof, Who created the same. But while these things
were doing to the bodies of the slain, albeit the Martyrs, not
frightened by them, did with great fortitude suffer, yet among the
brethren was there exceeding sorrow, because there was given them
no means of paying the last honors to the remains of the Saints,
neither secretly to withdraw any part thereof, (as the same history
testifies,) did the watchings of cruel sentinels permit. So, while
those which had been slain, in the tearing asunder of their limbs,
in the burning up of their bones, in the dispersion of their ashes,
could feel no misery; yet these who had nothing of them that they
could bury, did suffer torture of exceeding grief in pitying them;
because what those did in no sort feel, these in some sort did feel
for them, and where was henceforth for those no more suffering, yet
these did in woful compassion suffer for them.</p>

into <pb n="545" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_545.html" id="v.ix.xiii-Page_545"/>this discussion a question which should not be slighted.
It is said, namely, that dead men have at times either in dreams or
in some other way appeared to the living who knew not where their
bodies lay unburied, and have pointed out to them the place, and
admonished that the sepulture which was lacking should be afforded
them. These things if we shall answer to be false, we shall be
thought impudently to contradict the writings of certain faithful
men, and the senses of them who assure us that such things have
happened to themselves. But it is to be answered, that it does not
follow that we are to account the dead to have sense of these
things, because they appear in dreams to say or indicate or ask
this. For living men do also appear ofttimes to the living as they
sleep, while they themselves know not that they do appear; and they
are told by them, what they dreamed, namely, that in their dream
the speakers saw them doing or saying something. Then if it may be
that a person in a dream should see me indicating to him something
that has happened or even foretelling something about to happen,
while I am perfectly unwitting of the thing and altogether
regardless not only what he dreams, but whether he is awake while I
am asleep, or he asleep while I am awake, or whether at one and the
same time we are both awake or asleep, at what time he has the
dream in which he sees me: what marvel if the dead be unconscious
and insensible of these things, and, for all that, are seen by the
living in their dreams, and say something which those on awaking
find to be true? By angelical operations, then, I should think it
is effected, whether permitted from above, or commanded, that they
seem in dreams to say something about burying of their bodies, when
they whose the bodies are are utterly unconscious of it. Now this
is sometimes serviceably done; whether for some sort of solace to
the survivors, to whom pertain those dead whose likenesses<note place="end" n="2738" id="v.ix.xiii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.xiii-p3"> <i>Imagines</i></p></note> appear to
them as they dream; or whether that by these admonitions the human
race may be made to have regard to humanity of sepulture, which,
allow that it be no help to the departed, yet is there culpable
irreligiousness in slighting of it. Sometimes however, by
fallacious visions,<note place="end" n="2739" id="v.ix.xiii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.xiii-p4"> <i>Visis</i></p></note> men are cast into great errors,
who deserve to suffer this. As, if one should see in a dream, what
&#198;neas by poetic falsity is told to have seen in the world beneath:
and there should appear to him the likeness of some unburied man,
which should speak such words as Palinurus is said to have spoken
to him; and when he awakes, he should find the body in that place
where he heard say while dreaming, that it lay unburied, and was
admonished and asked to bury it when found; and because he finds
this to be true, should believe that the dead are buried on purpose
that their souls may pass to places from which he dreamed that the
souls of men unburied are by an infernal law prohibited: does he
not, in believing all this, exceedingly swerve from the path of
truth?</p>

13. Such, however, is human
infirmity, that when in a dream a person shall see a dead man, he
thinks it is the soul that he sees: but when he shall in like
manner dream of a living man, he has no doubt that it is not a soul
nor a body, but the likeness of a man that has appeared to him:
just as if it were not possible in regard of dead men, in the same
sort unconscious of it, that it should not be their souls, but
their likenesses that appear to the sleepers. Of a surety, when we
were at Milan, we heard tell of a certain person of whom was
demanded payment of a debt, with production of his deceased
father&#8217;s acknowledgment,<note place="end" n="2740" id="v.ix.xiv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.xiv-p2"> <i>Cautio</i></p></note> which debt unknown to the son the
father had paid, whereupon the man began to be very sorrowful, and
to marvel that his father while dying did not tell him what he owed
when he also made his will. Then in this exceeding anxiousness of
his, his said father appeared to him in a dream, and made known to
him where was the counter<note place="end" n="2741" id="v.ix.xiv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.xiv-p3"> <i>Recautum</i></p></note> acknowledgment by which that
acknowledgment was cancelled. Which when the young man had found
and showed, he not only rebutted the wrongful claim of a false
debt, but also got back his father&#8217;s note<note place="end" n="2742" id="v.ix.xiv-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.xiv-p4"> <i>Chirographum</i></p></note> of hand which the father had not
got back when the money was paid. Here then the soul of a man is
supposed to have had care for his son, and to have come to him in
his sleep, that, teaching him what he did not know, he might
relieve him of a great trouble. But about the very same time as we
heard this, it chanced at Carthage that the rhetorician Eulogius,
who had been my disciple in that art, being (as he himself, after
our return to Africa, told us the story) in course of lecturing to
his disciples on Cicero&#8217;s rhetorical books, as he looked over the
portion of reading which he was to deliver on the following day,
fell upon a certain passage, and not being able to understand it,
was scarce able to sleep for the trouble of his mind: in which
night, as he dreamed, I expounded to him that which he did not
understand; nay, <pb n="546" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_546.html" id="v.ix.xiv-Page_546"/>not I, but my likeness, while I
was unconscious of the thing, and far away beyond the sea, it might
be, doing, or it might be dreaming, some other thing, and not in
the least caring for his cares. In what way these things come
about, I know not: but in what way soever they come, why do we not
believe it comes in the same way for a person in a dream to see a
dead man, as it comes that he sees a living man? both, no doubt,
neither knowing nor caring who, or where, or when, dreams of their
images.</p>

14. Like dreams, moreover,
are also some visions of persons awake, who have had their senses
troubled, such as phrenetic persons, or those who are mad in any
way: for they too talk to themselves just as though they were
speaking to people verily present, and as well with absent as with
present, whose images they perceive, whether persons living or
dead. But just as they which live, are unconscious that they are
seen of them and talk with them; for indeed they are not really
themselves present, or themselves make speeches, but through
troubled senses, these persons are wrought upon by such-like
imaginary visions; just so they also who have departed this life,
to persons thus affected appear as present, while they be absent,
and whether any man sees them in regard of their image,<note place="end" n="2743" id="v.ix.xv-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.xv-p2"> <i>Imaginaliter</i></p></note> are

15. Similar to this is also
that condition when persons, with their senses more profoundedly in
abeyance than is the case in sleep, are occupied with the like
visions. For to them also appear images of quick and dead; but
then, when they return to their senses, whatever dead they say they
have seen are thought to have been verily with them: and they who
hear these things pay no heed to the circumstance that there were
seen in like manner the images of certain living persons, absent
and unconscious. A certain man by name Curma, of the municipal town
of Tullium, which is hard by Hippo, a poor member of the Curia,<note place="end" n="2744" id="v.ix.xvi-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.xvi-p2"> <i>Curialis</i></p></note> scarcely
competent to serve the office of a duumvir<note place="end" n="2745" id="v.ix.xvi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.xvi-p3"> <i>Duumviralitius</i></p></note> of that place, and a mere rustic,
being ill, and all his senses entranced, lay all but dead for
several days: a very slight breathing in his nostrils, which on
applying the hand was just felt, and barely betokened that he
lived, was all that kept him from being buried for dead. Not a limb
did he stir, nothing did he take in the way of sustenance, neither
in the eyes nor in any other bodily sense was he sensible of any
annoyance that impinged upon them. Yet he was seeing many things
like as in a dream, which, when at last after a great many days he
woke up, he told that he had seen. And first, presently after he
opened his eyes, Let some one go, said he, to the house of Curma
the smith, and see what is doing there. And when some one had gone
thither, the smith was found to have died in that moment that the
other had come back to his senses, and, it might almost be said,
revived from death. Then, as those who stood by eagerly listened,
he told them how the other had been ordered to be had up, when he
himself was dismissed; and that he had heard it said in that place
from which he had returned, that it was not Curma of the Curia, but
Curma the smith who had been ordered to be fetched to that place of
the dead. Well, in these dream-like visions of his, among those
deceased persons whom he saw handled according to the diversity of
their merits, he recognized also some whom he had known when alive.
That they were the very persons themselves I might perchance have
believed, had he not in the course of this seeming dream of his
seen also some who are alive even to this present time, namely,
some clerks of his district, by whose presbyter there he was told
to be baptized at Hippo by me, which thing he said had also taken
place. So then he had seen a presbyter, clerks, myself, persons, to
wit, not yet dead, in this vision in which he afterwards also saw
dead persons. Why may he not be thought to have seen these last in
the same way as he saw us? that is, both the one sort, and the
other, absent and unconscious, and consequently not the persons
themselves, but similitudes of them just as of the places? He saw,
namely, both a plot of ground where was that presbyter with the
clerks, and Hippo where he was by me seemingly baptized: in which
spots assuredly he was not, when he seemed to himself to be there.
For what was at that time going on there, he knew not: which,
without doubt, he would have known if he had verily been there. The
sights beheld, therefore, were those which are not presented in the
things themselves as they are, but shadowed forth in a sort of
images of the things. In fine, after much that he saw, he narrated
how he had, moreover, been led into Paradise, and how it was there
said to him, when he was thence dismissed to return to his own
family, &#8220;Go, be baptized, if thou wilt be in this place of the
blessed.&#8221; Thereupon, being admonished to be baptized by me, he
said it was done already. He who was talking with him replied,
&#8220;Go, be truly baptized; for that thou didst but see in the
vision.&#8221; After this he re<pb n="547" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_547.html" id="v.ix.xvi-Page_547"/>covered, went his way to Hippo.
Easter was now approaching, he gave his name among the other
Competents, alike with very many unknown to us; nor did he care to
make known the vision to me or to any of our people. He was
baptized, at the close of the holy days he returned to his own
place. After the space of two years or more, I learned the whole
matter; first, through a certain friend of mine and his at my own
table, while we were talking about some such matters: then I took
it up, and made the man in his own person tell me the story, in the
presence of some honest townsmen of his attesting the same, both
concerning his marvellous illness, how he lay all but dead for many
days, and about that other Curma the smith, what I have mentioned
above, and about all these matters; which, while he was telling me,
they recalled to mind, and assured me, that they had also at that
time heard them from his lips. Wherefore, just as he saw his own
baptism, and myself, and Hippo, and the basilica, and the
baptistery, not in the very realities, but in a sort of similitudes
of the things; and so likewise certain other living persons,
without consciousness on the part of the same living persons: then
why not just so those dead persons also, without consciousness on
the part of the same dead persons?</p>

evil, according to the unsearchable depth of His judgments? whether

own self, whom my pious mother would no night fail to visit, that
mother who by land and sea followed me that she might live with me.
Far be the thought that she should, by a life more happy, have been
made cruel, to that degree that when any thing vexes my heart she
should not even console in his sadness the son whom she loved with
an only love, whom she never wished to see mournful. But assuredly
that which the sacred Psalm sings in our ears, is true; &#8220;Because

that those were favored who deceased ere the evils came which
followed hard upon the decease, if also after death they feel
whatever things befall in the calamitousness of human life? Or
haply do we err in saying this, and in accounting them to be
quietly at rest whom the unquiet life of the living makes
solicitous? What then is that which to the most godly king Josias
God promised as a great benefit, that he should first die, that he
might not see the evils which He threatened should come to that
place and People? Which words of God are these: &#8220;Thus saith the
Lord God of Israel: concerning My words which thou hast heard, and

17. Some man may say: &#8220;If
there be not in the dead any care for the living, how is it that
the rich man, who was tormented in hell, asked father Abraham to
send Lazarus to his five brothers not as yet dead, and to take
course with them, that they should not come themselves also into
the same place of torments?&#8221;<note place="end" n="2750" id="v.ix.xviii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.xviii-p2"> <scripRef passage="Luke xvi. 24-29" id="v.ix.xviii-p2.2" parsed="|Luke|16|24|16|29" osisRef="Bible:Luke.16.24-Luke.16.29">Luke xvi. 24&#8211;29</scripRef></p></note> But does it follow, that because
the rich man said this, he knew what his brethren were doing, or
what they were suffering at that time? Just in that same way had he
care for the living, albeit what they were doing he wist not at
all, as we have care for the dead, albeit what they do we
confessedly wot not. For if we cared not for the dead, we should
not, as we do, supplicate God on their behalf. In fine, Abraham did
not send Lazarus, and also answered, that they have here Moses and
the Prophets, whom they ought to hear that they might not come to
those torments. Where again it occurs to ask, how it was that what
was doing here, father Abraham himself wist not, while he knew that
Moses and the Prophets are here, that is, their books, by obeying
which men should escape the torments of hell: and knew, in short,
that rich man to have lived in delights, but the poor man Lazarus
to have lived in labors and sorrows? For this also he says to him;
&#8220;Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime hast received good
things, but Lazarus evil things.&#8221; He knew then these things which
had taken place of course among the living, not among the dead.
True, but it may be that, not while the things were doing in their
lifetime, but after their death, he learned these things, by
information of Lazarus: that it be not false which the Prophet
saith, &#8220;Abraham hath not known us.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2751" id="v.ix.xviii-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.xviii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Is. lxiii. 16" id="v.ix.xviii-p3.2" parsed="|Isa|63|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.63.16">Is. lxiii. 16</scripRef></p></note></p>

18. So then we must confess
that the dead indeed do not know what is doing here, but while it
is in doing here: afterwards, however, they hear it from those who
from hence go to them at their death; not indeed every thing, but
what things those are allowed to make known who are suffered also
to remember these things; and which it is meet for those to hear,
whom they inform of the same. It may be also, that from the Angels,
who are present in the things which are doing here, the dead do
hear somewhat, which for each one of them to hear He judgeth right
to Whom all things are subject. For were there not Angels, who
could be present in places both of quick and dead, the Lord Jesus
had not said, &#8220;It came to pass also that the poor man died, and

should know the same, not only things past or present, but even
future, by the Spirit of God revealing them: like as not all men,
but the Prophets while they lived here did know, nor even they all
things, but only what things to be revealed to them the providence
of God judged meet. Moreover, that some from the dead are sent to

19. Hence too is solved that
question, how is it that the Martyrs, by the very benefits which
are given to them that pray, indicate that they take an interest in
the affairs of men, if the dead know not what the quick are doing.
For not only by effects of benefits, but in the very beholding of
men, it is certain,<note place="end" n="2760" id="v.ix.xx-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.xx-p2"> <i>Inquilinatum</i></p></note> that the Confessor Felix (whose
denizenship among you thou piously lovest) appeared when the
barbarians were attacking Nola, as we have heard not by uncertain
rumors, but by sure witnesses. But such things are of God
exhibited, far otherwise than as the usual order hath itself, unto
each kind of creatures apportioned. For it does not follow because
water was, when it pleased the Lord, in a moment changed into wine,
that we are not to regard the worth and efficacy of water in
<pb n="549" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_549.html" id="v.ix.xx-Page_549"/>the
proper order of the elements, as distinct from the rarity, or
rather singularity, of that divine work: nor because Lazarus rose
again, therefore that every dead man rises when he will; or that a
lifeless man is raised up by a living, in the same way as a
sleeping man by one who is awake. Other be the limits of human
things, other the signs of divine virtues: other they be that are
naturally, other that be miraculously done: albeit both unto nature
God is present that it may be, and unto miracles nature is not
lacking. We are not to think then, that to be interested in the
affairs of the living is in the power of any departed who please,
only because to some men&#8217;s healing or help the Martyrs be
present: but rather we are to understand that it must needs be by a
Divine power that the Martyrs are interested in affairs of the
living, from the very fact that for the departed to be by their
proper nature interested in affairs of the living is

20. Howbeit it is a question
which surpasses the strength of my understanding, after what manner
the Martyrs aid them who by them, it is certain, are helped;
whether themselves by themselves be present at the same time in so
different places, and by so great distance lying apart one from
another, either where their Memorials are, or beside their
Memorials, wheresoever they are felt to be present: or whether,
while they themselves, in a place congruous with their merits, are
removed from all converse with mortals, and yet do in a general
sort pray for the needs of their suppliants, (like as we pray for
the dead, to whom however we are not present, nor know where they
be or what they be doing,) God Almighty, Who is every where
present, neither bounded in<note place="end" n="2761" id="v.ix.xxi-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.xxi-p2"> <i>Concretus</i></p></note> with us nor remote from us,
hearing and granting the Martyrs&#8217; prayers, doth by angelic
ministries every where diffused afford to men those solaces, to
whom in the misery of this life He seeth meet to afford the same,
and, touching His Martyrs, doth where He will, when He will, how He
will, and chiefest through their Memorials, because this He knoweth
to be expedient for us unto edifying of the faith of Christ for
Whose confession they suffered, by marvellous and ineffable power
and goodness cause their merits to be had in honor. A matter is
this, too high that I should have power to attain unto it, too
abstruse that I should be able to search it out; and therefore
which of these two be the case, or whether perchance both one and
the other be the case, that sometimes these things be done by very
presence of the Martyrs, sometimes by Angels taking upon them the
person of the Martyrs, I dare not define; rather would I seek this
at them who know it. For it is not to be thought that no man knows
these things: (not indeed he who thinks he knows, and knows not,)
for there be gifts of God, Who bestows on these some one, on those
some other, according to the Apostle who says, that &#8220;to each one

21. Such, we may believe, was
that John the Monk, whom the elder Theodosius, the Emperor,
consulted concerning the issue of the civil war: seeing he had also
the gift of prophecy. For that not each several person has a
several one of those gifts, but that one man may have more gifts
than one, I make no question. This John, then, when once a certain
most religious woman desired to see him, and to obtain this did
through her husband make vehement entreaty, refused indeed this
request because he had never allowed this to women, but &#8220;Go,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;tell thy wife, she shall see me this night, but in her
sleep.&#8221; And so it came to pass: and he gave her advice, whatever
was meet to be given to a wedded believing woman. And she, on her
awaking, made known to her husband that she had seen a man of God,
such as he knew him to be, and what she had been told by him. The
person who learned this from them, reported it to me, a grave man
and a noble, and most worthy to be believed. But if I myself had
seen that holy monk, because (it is said) he was most patient in
hearing questions and most wise in answering, I would have sought
of him, as touching our question, whether he himself came to that
woman in sleep, that is to say, his spirit in the form of his body,
just as we dream that we see ourselves in the form of our own body;
or whether, while he himself was doing something else, or, if
asleep, was dreaming of <pb n="550" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_550.html" id="v.ix.xxii-Page_550"/>something else, it was either
by an Angel or in some other way that such vision took place in the
woman&#8217;s dream; and that it would so be, as he promised, he
himself foreknew by the Spirit of prophecy revealing the same. For
if he was himself present to her in her dream, of course it was by
miraculous grace that he was enabled so to do, not by nature; and
by God&#8217;s gift, not by faculty of his own. But if, while he was
doing some other thing or sleeping and occupied with other sights,
the woman saw him in her sleep, then doubtless some such thing took
place, as that is which we read in the Acts of the Apostles, where
the Lord Jesus speaks to Ananias concerning Saul,<note place="end" n="2772" id="v.ix.xxii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.xxii-p2"> <scripRef passage="Acts ix. 12" id="v.ix.xxii-p2.2" parsed="|Acts|9|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.9.12">Acts ix. 12</scripRef></p></note> and
informs him that Saul has seen Ananias coming unto him, while
Ananias himself wist not of it. The man of God would make answer to
me of these things as the case might be, and then about the Martyrs
I should go on to ask of him, whether they be themselves present in
dreams, or in whatever other way to those who see them in what
shape they will; and above all when the demons in men confess
themselves tormented by the Martyrs, and ask them to spare them; or
whether these things be wrought through angelic powers, to the
honor and commendation of the Saints for men&#8217;s profit, while
those are in supreme rest, and wholly free for other far better
sights, apart from us, and praying for us. For it chanced at Milan
at (the tomb of) the holy Martyrs Protasius and Gervasius, that
Ambrose the bishop, at that time living, being expressly named, in
like manner as were the dead whose names they were rehearsing, the
demons confessed him and besought him to spare them, he being the
while otherwise engaged, and when this was taking place, altogether
unwitting of it. Or whether indeed these things are wrought,
somewhiles by very presence of the Martyrs, otherwhiles by that of
Angels; and whether it be possible, or by what tokens possible, for
us to discriminate these two cases; or whether to perceive and to
judge of these things none be able, but he which hath that gift
through God&#8217;s Spirit, &#8220;dividing unto every man severally as He
will:&#8221;<note place="end" n="2773" id="v.ix.xxii-p2.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.xxii-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xii. 11" id="v.ix.xxii-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|12|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.11">1 Cor. xii. 11</scripRef></p></note> the same
John, methinks, would discourse to me of all these matters, as I
should wish; that either by his teaching I might learn, and what I
should be told should know to be true and certain; or I should
believe what I knew not, upon his telling me what things he knew.
But if peradventure he should make answer out of holy Scripture,
and say, &#8220;Things higher than thou, seek thou not; and things
stronger than thou, search thou not; but what the Lord hath
commanded thee, of those things bethink thee alway:&#8221;<note place="end" n="2774" id="v.ix.xxii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.xxii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Ecclus. iii. 22" id="v.ix.xxii-p4.2" parsed="|Sir|3|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.3.22">Ecclus. iii. 22</scripRef></p></note> this also
I should thankfully accept. For it is no small gain if, when any
things are obscure and uncertain to us, and we not able to
comprehend them, it be at any rate clear and certain that we are
not to seek them; and what thing each one wishes to learn,
accounting it to be profitable that he should know it, he should
learn that it is no harm that he know it not.</p>

22. Which things being so,
let us not think that to the dead for whom we have a care, any
thing reaches save what by sacrifices either of the altar, or of
prayers, or of alms, we solemnly supplicate: although not to all
for whom they are done be they profitable, but to them only by whom
while they live it is obtained that they should be profitable. But
forasmuch as we discern not who these be, it is meet to do them for
all regenerate persons, that none of them may be passed by to whom
these benefits may and ought to reach. For better it is that these
things shall be superfluously done to them whom they neither hinder
nor help, than lacking to them whom they help. More diligently
however doth each man these things for his own near and dear
friends, in order that they may be likewise done unto him by his.
But as for the burying of the body, whatever is bestowed on that,
is no aid of salvation, but an office of humanity, according to
that affection by which &#8220;no man ever hateth his own flesh.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2775" id="v.ix.xxiii-p1.1"><p class="endnote" id="v.ix.xxiii-p2"> <scripRef passage="Eph. v. 29" id="v.ix.xxiii-p2.2" parsed="|Eph|5|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.5.29">Eph. v. 29</scripRef></p></note> Whence it

who believe not the resurrection of the flesh, how much more are
they beholden to do the same who do believe; that so, an office of
this kind bestowed upon a body, dead but yet to rise again and to
remain to eternity, may also be in some sort a testimony of the
same faith? But, that a person is buried at the memorials of the
Martyrs, this, I think, so far profits the departed, that while
commending him also to the Martyrs&#8217; patronage, the affection of
supplication on his behalf is increased.</p>

hast thought meet to inquire of me, thou hast such reply as I have
been able to render: which if it be more than enough prolix, thou
must excuse this, for it was done through love of holding longer

it was at his instance that I have done thy bidding. For with so
