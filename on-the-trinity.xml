<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p3"><span class="c9" id="iv.i.i-p3.1">The</span> 
doctrine of the Divine Unity is a truth of natural religion; the
doctrine of the Trinity is a truth of revealed religion. The
various systems of natural theism present arguments for the Divine
existence, unity, and attributes, but proceed no further. They do
not assert and endeavor to demonstrate that the Supreme Being is
three persons in one essence. It is because this doctrine is not
discoverable by human reason, that the Christian church has been
somewhat shy of attempts to construct it analytically; or even to
defend it upon grounds of reason. The keen Dr. South expresses the
common sentiment, when he remarks that &#8220;as he that denies this
fundamental article of the Christian religion may lose his soul, so
he that much strives to understand it may lose his wits.&#8221; Yet all
the truths of revelation, like those of natural religion, have in
them the element of reason, and are capable of a rational defense.
At the very least their self-consistence can be shown, and
objections to them can be answered. And this is a rational process.
For one of the surest characteristics of reason is, freedom from
self contradiction, and consonance with acknowledged truths in
other provinces of human inquiry and belief.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p4">It is a remarkable fact, that the
earlier forms of Trinitarianism are among the most metaphysical and
speculative of any in dogmatic history. The controversy with the
Arian and the Semi-Arian, brought out a statement and defense of
the truth, not only upon scriptural but ontological grounds. Such a
powerful dialectician as Athanasius, while thoroughly and intensely
scriptural&#8212;while starting from the text of scripture, and
subjecting it to a rigorous exegesis&#8212;did not hesitate to pursue
the Arian and Semi-Arian dialectics to its most recondite fallacy
in its subtlest recesses. If any one doubts this, let him read the
four Orations of Athanasius, and his defence of the Nicene Decrees.
In some sections of Christendom, it has been contended that the
doctrine of the Trinity should be received without any attempt at
all to establish its rationality and intrinsic necessity. In this
case, the tenets of eternal generation and procession have been
regarded as going beyond the Scripture data, and if not positively
rejected, have been thought to hinder rather than assist faith in
three divine persons and one God. But the history of opinions shows
that such sections of the church have not proved to be the
strongest defenders of the Scripture statement, nor the most
successful in keeping clear of the Sabellian, Arian, or even
Socinian departure from it.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p5">Those churches which have followed
Scripture most implicitly, and have most feared human speculation,
are the very churches which have inserted into their creeds the
most highly analytic statement that has yet been made of the
doctrine of the Trinity. The Nicene Trinitarianism is incorporated
into nearly all the symbols of modern Christendom; and this
specifies, particularly, the tenets of eternal generation and
procession with their corollaries. The English Church, to whose
great divines, Hooker, Bull, Waterland, and Pearson, scientific
Trinitarianism owes a very lucid and careful statement, has added
the Athanasian creed to the Nicene. The Presbyterian churches,
distinguished for the closeness of their adherence to the simple
Scripture, yet call upon their membership to confess, <pb n="4" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_4.html" id="iv.i.i-Page_4"/>that &#8220;in the
unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance,
power, and eternity; God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy
Ghost. The Father is of none, neither begotten nor proceeding; the
Son is eternally begotten of the Father; the Holy Ghost eternally
proceeding from the Father and the Son.&#8221;<note place="end" n="2" id="iv.i.i-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.i-p6">

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p7">The treatise of Augustin upon the
Trinity, which is here made accessible to the English reader, is
one of the ablest produced in the patristic age. The author devoted
nearly thirty years of his matured life to its composition (<span class="c19" id="iv.i.i-p7.1">A.D.</span> 400 to 428). He was continually touching
and retouching it, and would have delayed its publication longer
than he did, had a copy not been obtained surreptitiously and
published. He seems to have derived little assistance from others;
for although the great Greek Trinitarians&#8212;Athanasius, the two
Gregories, and Basil&#8212;had published their treatises, yet he
informs us that his knowledge of Greek, though sufficient for
understanding the exegetical and practical writings of his brethren
of the Greek Church, was not adequate to the best use of their
dialectical and metaphysical compositions.<note place="end" n="3" id="iv.i.i-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.i-p8">
That Augustin had considerable acquaintance with
Greek is proved by his many references and citations throughout his
writings. In this work, see XII. vii. 11; XII. xiv. 22; XIII. x.
14; XIV. i. 1; XV. ix. 15. His statement in III. i. 1, is, that he
was &#8220;not <i>so</i> familiar with the Greek tongue (<i>Gr&#230;c&#230;
lingu&#230; non sit nobis tantus habitus</i>), as to be able to read
and understand the books that treat of such [metaphysical]
topics.&#8221; In V. viii. 10, he remarks that he does not comprehend
the distinction which the Greek Trinitarians make between
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.i-p8.1">&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#8055;&#945; 
and &#8017;&#960;&#8057;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>; which shows that he
had not read the work of Gregory of Nyssa, in which it is defined
with great clearness. One may have a good knowledge of a language
for general purposes, and yet be unfamiliar with its philosophical
nomenclature.</p></note> Accordingly, there is no trace in
this work of the writings of the Greek Trinitarians, though a
substantial agreement with them. The only Trinitarian author to
whom he alludes is Hilary&#8212;a highly acute and abstruse
Trinitarian.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p9">In his general position, Augustin
agrees with the Nicene creed; but laying more emphasis upon the
consubstantiality of the persons, and definitely asserting the
procession of the Spirit from the Father and Son. Some dogmatic
historians seem to imply that he differed materially from the
Nicene doctrine on the point of <i>subordination</i>. Hagenbach
(Smith&#8217;s Ed. &#167; 95) asserts that &#8220;Augustin completely purified
the dogma of the Trinity from the older vestiges of
subordination;&#8221; and adds that &#8220;such vestiges are unquestionably
to be found in the most orthodox Fathers, not only in the East but
also in the West.&#8221; He cites Hilary and Athanasius as examples,
and quotes the remark of Gieseler, that &#8220;the idea of a
subordination lies at the basis of such declarations.&#8221; Neander
(II. 470, Note 2) says that Augustin &#8220;kept at a distance
everything that bordered on subordinationism.&#8221; These statements
are certainly too sweeping and unqualified. There are three kinds
of subordination: the filial or trinitarian; the theanthropic; and
the Arian. The first is taught, and the second implied, in the
Nicene creed. The last is denied and excluded. Accordingly,
dogmatic historians like Petavius, Bull, Waterland, and Pearson,
contend that the Nicene creed, in affirming the filial, but denying
the Arian subordination; in teaching subordination as to person and
relationship, but denying it as to essence; enunciates a revealed
truth, and that this is endorsed by all the Trinitarian fathers,
Eastern and Western. And there certainly can be no doubt that
Augustin held this view. He maintains, over and over again, that
Sonship as a relationship is second and subordinate to Fatherhood;
that while a Divine Father and a Divine Son must necessarily be of
the very same nature and grade of being, like a human father and a
human son, yet the latter issues from the former, not the former
from the latter. Augustin&#8217;s phraseology on this point is as
positive as that of Athanasius, and in some respects even more bold
and capable of misinterpretation. He denominates the Father the
&#8220;beginning&#8221; (principium) of the Son, and the Father and Son the
&#8220;beginning&#8221; (principium) of the Holy Spirit. &#8220;The Father is
the beginning of the whole divinity, or if it is better so
expressed, deity.&#8221; IV. xx. 29. &#8220;In their mutual
rela<pb n="5" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_5.html" id="iv.i.i-Page_5"/>tion to one another in the Trinity itself, if the
begetter is a beginning (principium) in relation to that which he
begets, the Father is a beginning in relation to the Son, because
he begets Him.&#8221; V. xiv. 15. Since the Holy Spirit proceeds from
both Father and Son, &#8220;the Father and Son are a beginning
(principium) of the Holy Spirit, not two beginnings.&#8221; V. xiv. 15.
Compare also V. xiii.; X. iv.; and annotations pp. Augustin employs
this term &#8220;beginning&#8221; only in relation to the person, not to
the essence. There is no &#8220;beginning,&#8221; or source, when the
essence itself is spoken of. Consequently, the &#8220;subordination&#8221;
(implied in a &#8220;beginning&#8221; by generation and spiration) is not
the Arian subordination, as to essence, but the trinitarian
subordination, as to person and relation.<note place="end" n="4" id="iv.i.i-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.i-p10">
For an analysis of Augustin&#8217;s Trinitarianism,

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p11">Augustin starts with the assumption
that man was made in the image of the <i>triune</i> God, the God of
revelation; not in the image of the God of natural religion, or the
untriune deity of the nations. Consequently, it is to be expected
that a trinitarian analogue can be found in his mental
constitution. If man is God&#8217;s image, he will show traces of it in
every respect. All acknowledge that the Divine unity, and all the
communicable attributes, have their finite correspondents in the
unity and attributes of the human mind. But the Latin father goes
further than this. This, in his view, is not the whole of the
Divine image. When God says, &#8220;Let <i>us</i> make man in <i>
our</i> image, after <i>our</i> likeness&#8221; (<scripRef passage="Gen. i. 26" id="iv.i.i-p11.2" parsed="|Gen|1|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.26">Gen. i. 26</scripRef>), Augustin
understands these words to be spoken <i>by</i> the Trinity, and <i>
of</i> the Trinity&#8212;by and of the true God, the God of revelation:
the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, one God. He denies that this is
merely the <i>pluralis excellenti&#230;</i>, and that the meaning of
these words would be expressed by a change of the plural to the
singular, and to the reading, &#8220;Let <i>me</i> make man in <i>
my</i> image, after <i>my</i> likeness.&#8221; &#8220;For if the Father
alone had made man without the Son, it would not have been written,
&#8216;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.&#8217;&#8221; City of
God XVI. vi.; Trinity I. vii. 14. In Augustin&#8217;s opinion, the Old
Testament declaration that God is a unity, does not exclude the New
Testament declaration that he is a trinity. &#8220;For&#8221; says he,
&#8220;that which is written, &#8216;Hear O Israel: the Lord our God is one
Lord&#8217; ought certainly not to be understood as if the Son were
excepted, or the Holy Spirit were excepted; which one Lord our God
we rightly call our Father, as regenerating us by his grace.&#8221;
Trinity V. xi. 12. How far Moses <i>understood</i> the full meaning
of the Divine communication and instruction, is one thing. <i>
Who</i> it really and actually was that made the communication to
him, is another. Even if we assume, though with insufficient reason
for so doing, that Moses himself had no intimation of the Trinity,
it does not follow that it was not the Trinity that inspired him,
and all the Hebrew prophets. The apostle Peter teaches that the Old
Testament inspiration was a Trinitarian inspiration, when he says
that &#8220;the prophets who prophesied of the grace that should come,
searched what the Spirit of <i>Christ</i> which was in them did
signify, when it testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ,
and the glory that should follow.&#8221; (<scripRef passage="1 Pet. i. 10, 11" id="iv.i.i-p11.4" parsed="|1Pet|1|10|1|11" osisRef="Bible:1Pet.1.10-1Pet.1.11">1 Pet. i. 10, 11</scripRef>).</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p12">In asserting, however, that an
image of the Trinity exists in man&#8217;s nature, Augustin is careful
to observe that it is utterly imperfect and inadequate. He has no
thought or expectation of clearing up the mystery by any analogy
whatever. He often gives expression to his sense of the
inscrutability and incomprehensibility of the Supreme Being, in
language of the most lowly and awe-struck adoration. &#8220;I pray to
our Lord God himself, of whom we ought always to think, and yet of
whom we are not able to think worthily, and whom no speech is
sufficient to declare, that He will grant me both help for
understanding and explaining that which I design, and pardon if in
anything I offend.&#8221; V. i. 1. &#8220;O Lord the one God, God the
Trinity, whatever I have said in these books that is of Thine, may
they acknowledge who are Thine; if anything of my own, may it be
pardoned both by Thee and by those who are Thine. Amen.&#8221; XV.
xxviii.</p><pb n="6" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_6.html" id="iv.i.i-Page_6"/>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p13">Augustin&#8217;s method in this work is (1.) The exegetical;
(2.) The rational. He first deduces the doctrine of the Trinity
from Scripture, by a careful collation and combination of the
texts, and then defends it against objections, and illustrates it
by the analogies which he finds in nature generally, and in the
human mind particularly. The Scripture argument is contained in the
first seven books; the rational in the last eight. The first part
is, of course, the most valuable of the two. Though the reader may
not be able to agree with Augustin in his interpretation of some
Scripture passages, particularly some which he cites from the Old
Testament, he will certainly be impressed by the depth, acumen, and
accuracy with which the Latin father reaches and exhausts the
meaning of the acknowledged trinitarian texts. Augustin lived in an
age when the Scriptures and the Greek and Roman classics were
nearly all that the student had, upon which to expend his
intellectual force. There was considerable metaphysics, it is true,
but no physics, and little mathematics. There was consequently a
more undivided and exclusive attention bestowed upon revealed
religion as embodied in the Scriptures, and upon ethics and natural
religion as contained in the classics, than has ever been bestowed
by any subsequent period in Christendom. One result was that
scripture was expounded by scripture; things spiritual by things
spiritual. This appears in the exegetical part of this treatise.
Augustin reasons out of the Scriptures; not out of metaphysics or
physics.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p14">The second, or speculative division
of the work, is that which will be most foreign to the thinking of
some trinitarians. In it they will find what seems to them to be a
philosophy, rather than an interpretation of the word of God. We
shall, therefore, in this introductory essay, specify some of the
advantages, as it seems to us, of the general method of defending
and illustrating the doctrine of the Trinity employed by Augustin
and the patristic Trinitarians.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p15">1. Fuller justice is done to
Scripture by this method. Revelation denominates the first
trinitarian person the Father, the second the Son, the third the
Spirit. These terms are literal, not metaphorical; because the
relations denoted by them are eternally in the essence. Scripture
clearly teaches that the Father is such from eternity.
Consequently, &#8220;paternity&#8221; (implied in the name Father) can no
more be ascribed to the first person of the Godhead in a figurative
sense, than eternity can be. For a person that is a father must be
so in relation to a son. No son, no father. Consequently, an <i>
eternal</i> Father implies an eternal Son. And the same reasoning
holds true of the relation of the Father and Son to the Spirit. The
terms Father, Son, and Spirit, in the baptismal formula and the
apostolic benediction, must designate primary and eternal
distinctions. The rite that initiates into the kingdom of God,
certainly would not be administered in three names that denote only
assumed and temporal relations of God; nor would blessings for time
and eternity be invoked from God under such secondary
names.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p16">Hence, these trinal names given to
God in the baptismal formula and the apostolic benediction,
actually <i>force</i> upon the trinitarian theologian, the ideas of
paternity, generation, filiation, spiration, and procession. He
cannot reflect upon the implication of these names without forming
these ideas, and finding himself necessitated to concede their
literal validity and objective reality. He cannot say that the
first person is the Father, and then deny that he &#8220;begets.&#8221; He
cannot say that the second person is the Son, and then deny that he
is &#8220;begotten.&#8221; He cannot say that the third person is the
Spirit, and then deny that he &#8220;proceeds&#8221; by &#8220;spiration&#8221;
(<i>spiritus quia spiratus</i>) from the Father and Son. When
therefore Augustin, like the primitive fathers generally, endeavors
to illustrate this eternal, necessary, and constitutional
energizing and activity (<i>opera ad intra</i>) in the Divine
Essence, whereby the Son issues from the Father and the Spirit from
Father and Son, by the emanation of sunbeam from sun, light from
light, river from fountain, thought from mind, word <pb n="7" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_7.html" id="iv.i.i-Page_7"/>from
thought&#8212;when the ternaries from nature and the human mind are
introduced to elucidate the Trinity&#8212;nothing more is done than
when by other well-known and commonly adopted analogies the Divine
unity, or omniscence, or omnipresence, is sought to be illustrated.
There is no analogy taken from the finite that will clear up the
mystery of the infinite&#8212;whether it be the mystery of the eternity
of God, or that of his trinity. But, at the same time, by the use
of these analogies the mind is kept close up to the Biblical term
or statement, and is not allowed to content itself with only a
half-way understanding of it. Such a method brings thoroughness and
clearness into the interpretation of the Word of God.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p17">2. A second advantage in this
method is, that it shows the doctrine of the Trinity to be
inseparable from that of the Unity of God. The Deistical conception
of the Divine unity is wholly different from the Christian. The
former is that of natural religion, formed by the unassisted human
mind in its reflection upon the Supreme Being. The latter is that
of revealed religion, given to the human mind by inspiration. The
Deistical unity is mere singleness. The Christian unity is a
trinality. The former is a unit. The latter a true unity, and
union. The former is meagre, having few contents. The latter is a
plenitude&#8212;what St. Paul denominates &#8220;the fullness of the
Godhead&#8221; (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.i-p17.1">&#960;&#955;&#8053;&#961;&#969;&#956;&#945;
&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>).
<scripRef passage="Coloss. i. 9" id="iv.i.i-p17.2" parsed="|Col|1|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.1.9">Coloss. i. 9</scripRef>.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p18">It follows, consequently, that the
Divine unity cannot be discussed by itself without reference to
trinality, as the Deist and the Socinian endeavor to do.<note place="end" n="5" id="iv.i.i-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.i-p19">
The Mohammedan conception of the Divine Unity,
also, is deistic. In energetically rejecting the doctrine of the
Trinity, the Mohammedan is the Oriental Unitarian.</p></note> Trinality belongs as necessarily and
intrinsically to the Divine unity as eternity does to the Divine
essence. &#8220;If,&#8221; says Athanasius (Oration I. 17) &#8220;there was not
a Blessed Trinity from eternity, but only a unity existed first,
which at length became a Trinity, it follows that the Holy Trinity
must have been at one time imperfect, and at another time entire:
imperfect until the Son came to be created, as the Arians maintain,
and then entire afterwards.&#8221; If we follow the teachings of
Revelation, and adopt the revealed idea of God, we may not discuss
mere and simple unity, nor mere and simple trinality; but we must
discuss unity <i>in</i> trinality, and trinality <i>in</i> unity.
We may not think of a monad which originally, and in the order
either of nature or of time, is not trinal, but becomes so. The
instant there is a monad, there is a triad; the instant there is a
unity, there are Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Christian
Trinity is not that of Sabellius: namely, an original untrinal
monad that subsequently, in the order of nature if not of time,
becomes a triad; whereby four factors are introduced into the
problem. God is not one <i>and</i> three, but one <i>in</i> three.
There is no primary monad, as such, and without trinality, to which
the three distinctions are secondary adjuncts. The monad, or
essence, never exists in and by itself as untrinalized, as in the
Sabellian scheme. It exists only as in the three Persons; only as
trinalized. The Essence, consequently, is not prior to the Persons,
either in the order of nature or of time, nor subsequent to them,
but simultaneously and eternally in and with them.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p20">The Primitive church took this
ground with confidence. Unity and trinality were inseparable in
their view. The term God meant for them the Trinity. A
&#8220;theologian,&#8221; in their nomenclature, was a trinitarian. They
called the Apostle John <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.i-p20.1">&#8001;
&#952;&#949;&#8057;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>, because he was
enlightened by the Holy Spirit to make fuller disclosures, in the
preface to his Gospel, concerning the deity of the Logos and the
doctrine of the Trinity, than were the other evangelists. And they
gave the same epithet to Gregory Nazianzum, because of the acumen
and insight of his trinitarian treatises. This work of Augustin
adopts the same position, and defends it with an ability second to
none.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p21">3. A third advantage of this method
of illustrating the doctrine of the Trinity is, that it goes to
show that the personality of God depends upon the trinality of the
Divine Essence<pb n="8" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_8.html" id="iv.i.i-Page_8"/>&#8212;that if there are no interior
distinctions in the Infinite Being, he cannot be
self-contemplative, self-cognitive, or self-communing.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p22">This is an important and valuable
feature of the method in question, when viewed in its bearing upon
the modern assertion that an Infinite Being cannot be personal.
This treatise of Augustin does not develope the problem upon this
point, but it leads to it. In illustrating the Trinity by the
ternaries in nature, and especially in the human mind, he aims only
to show that trinality of a certain kind does not conflict with <i>
unity</i> of a certain kind. Memory, understanding, and will are
three faculties, yet one soul. Augustin is content with elucidating
the Divine unity by such illustrations. The elucidation of the
Divine <i>personality</i> by them, was not attempted in his day nor
in the Medi&#230;val and Reformation churches. The conflict with
pantheism forced this point upon the attention of the Modern
church.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p23">At the same time, these Christian
fathers who took the problem of the Trinity into the centre of the
Divine essence, and endeavored to show its necessary grounds there,
prepared the way for showing, by the same method, that trinality is
not only consistent with personality, but is actually indispensable
to it. In a brief essay like this, only the briefest hints can be
indicated.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p24">If God is personal, he is
self-conscious. Self-consciousness is, (1), the power which a
rational spirit, or mind, has of making itself its own object; and,
(2), of knowing that it has done so. If the first step is taken,
and not the second, there is no self-consciousness. For the subject
would not know that the object is the <i>self</i>. And the second
step cannot be taken, if the first has not been. These two acts of
a rational spirit, or mind, involve three distinctions in it, or
three modes of it. The whole mind as a subject contemplates the
very same whole mind as an object. Here are two distinctions, or
modes of one mind. And the very same whole mind perceives that the
contemplating subject and the contemplated object are one and the
same essence or being. Here are three modes of one mind, each
distinct from the others, yet all three going to make up the one
self-conscious spirit. Unless there were these three distinctions,
there would be no self-knowledge. Mere singleness, a mere subject
without an object, is incompatible with
self-consciousness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p25">In denying distinctions in the
Divine Essence, while asserting its personality, Deism, with
Socinianism and Mohammedanism, contends that God can be
self-knowing and self-communing as a single subject without an
object. The controversy, consequently, is as much between the deist
and the psychologist, as it is between him and the trinitarian. It
is as much a question whether his view of personality and
self-consciousness is correct, as whether his interpretation of
Scripture is. For the dispute involves the necessary conditions of
personality. If a true psychology does not require trinality in a
spiritual essence in order to its own self-contemplation, and
self-knowledge, and self-communion, then the deist is correct; but
if it does, then he is in error. That the study of
self-consciousness in modern metaphysics has favored
trinitarianism, is unquestionable. Even the spurious trinitarianism
which has grown up in the schools of the later pantheism goes to
show, that a trinal constitution is requisite in an essence, in
order to explain self-consciousness, and that absolute singleness,
or the absence of all interior distinctions, renders the problem
insoluble.<note place="end" n="6" id="iv.i.i-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.i-p26">
&#8220;That view of the divine nature which makes it
inconsistent with the Incarnation and Trinity is <i>
philosophically</i> imperfect, as well as scripturally
incorrect.&#8221; H. B. Smith: <i>Faith and Philosophy</i>, p.
191.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p27">But the authority of Scripture is
higher than that of psychology, and settles the matter. Revelation
unquestionably discloses a deity who is &#8220;blessed forever;&#8221;
whose blessedness is <i>independent</i> of the universe which he
has made from nonentity, and who must therefore find all the
conditions of blessedness within himself alone. He is blessed from
eternity, in his own self-contemplation and self-communion. He does
not need the universe in order <pb n="9" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_9.html" id="iv.i.i-Page_9"/>that he may have an object which
he can know, which he can love, and over which he can rejoice.

creation, the Eternal Wisdom &#8220;was by Him as one brought up with
Him, and was daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him&#8221;
(<scripRef passage="Prov. viii. 30" id="iv.i.i-p27.7" parsed="|Prov|8|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.8.30">Prov. viii. 30</scripRef>); and the
Eternal Word &#8220;was in the beginning with God&#8221; (<scripRef passage="John i. 2" id="iv.i.i-p27.9" parsed="|John|1|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.2">John i. 2</scripRef>); and &#8220;the
Only Begotten Son (or God Only Begotten, as the uncials read) was
eternally in the bosom of the Father&#8221; (<scripRef passage="John i. 18" id="iv.i.i-p27.11" parsed="|John|1|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.18">John i. 18</scripRef>).</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p28">Here is society within the Essence,
and wholly independent of the universe; and communion and
blessedness resulting therefrom. But this is impossible to an
essence without personal distinctions. Not the singular Unit of the
deist, but the plural Unity of the trinitarian, explains this. A
subject without an object could not know. What is there to be
known? Could not love. What is there to be loved? Could not
rejoice. What is there to rejoice over? And the object cannot be
the universe. The <i>infinite</i> and <i>eternal</i> object of
God&#8217;s infinite and eternal knowledge, love, and joy, cannot be
his creation: because this is neither eternal, nor infinite. There
was a time when the universe was not; and if God&#8217;s
self-consciousness and blessedness depends upon the universe, there
was a time when God was neither self-conscious nor blessed. The
objective God for the subjective God must, therefore, be very God
of very God, begotten not made, the eternal Son of the eternal
Father.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p29">The same line of reasoning applies
to the third trinitarian person, but there is no need of going
through with it. The history of opinion shows, that if the first
two eternal distinctions are conceded, there is no denial of the
reality and eternity of the third.<note place="end" n="7" id="iv.i.i-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.i-p30">

<p class="c28" id="iv.i.i-p31">The analogue derived from the
nature of finite personality and self-consciousness has one great
advantage&#8212;namely, that it illustrates the independence of the
Divine personality and self-consciousness. The later pantheism (not
the earlier of Spinoza) constructs a kind of trinity, but it is
dependent upon the universe. God distinguishes Himself from the <i>
world</i>, and thereby finds the object required for the subject.
But this implies either that the world is eternal, or else, that
God is not eternally self-conscious. The Christian trinitarianism,
on the contrary, finds all the media and conditions of
self-consciousness within the Divine Essence. God distinguishes
himself from <i>himself</i>, not from the universe. The eternal
Father beholds himself in the eternal Son, his <i>alter ego</i>,
the &#8220;express image of his own person&#8221; (<scripRef passage="Heb. i. 3" id="iv.i.i-p31.2" parsed="|Heb|1|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.1.3">Heb. i. 3</scripRef>). God does
not struggle gradually into self-consciousness, as in the Hegelian
scheme, by the help of the universe. Before that universe was in
existence, and in the solitude of his own eternity and
self-sufficiency, he had within his own essence all the media and
conditions of self-consciousness. And after the worlds were called
into being, the Divine personality remained the same immutable and
infinite self-knowledge, unaffected by anything in his
handiwork.</p>

<p class="c29" id="iv.i.i-p32">&#8220;O Light Eterne, sole in thyself

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p35">While, however, this analogue from
the conditions of finite personality approaches nearer to the
eternal distinctions in the Godhead than does that ternary which
Augustin employs&#8212;namely, memory, understanding, and will&#8212;yet
like all finite analogies to the Infinite it is inadequate. For the
subject-ego, object-ego, and ego-percipient, are not so essentially
distinct and completely objective to each other, as are the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit. They cannot employ the personal pronouns in
reference to each other. They cannot reciprocally perform acts and
discharge functions towards each other, like the <pb n="10" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_10.html" id="iv.i.i-Page_10"/>Divine Three.
Revelation is explicit upon this point. It specifies at least the
following twelve actions and relations, that incontestably prove
the conscious distinctness and mutual objectivity of the persons of
the Trinity. One divine person loves another (<scripRef passage="John iii. 35" id="iv.i.i-p35.2" parsed="|John|3|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.3.35">John iii. 35</scripRef>); dwells in

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p36">Such are some of the salient
features of this important treatise upon the Trinity. It has its
defects; but they pertain to the form more than to the matter; to
arrangement and style more than to dogma. Literary excellence is
not the forte of the patristic writers. Hardly any of them are
literary artists. Lactantius among the Latins, and Chrysostom among
the Greeks, are almost the only fathers that have rhetorical grace.
And none of them approach the beauty of the classic writers, as
seen in the harmonious flow and diction of Plato, and the exquisite
finish of Horace and Catullus.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p37">Augustin is prolix, repetitious,
and sometimes leaves his theme to discuss cognate but distantly
related subjects. This appears more in the last eight chapters,
which are speculative, than in the first seven, which are
scriptural. The material in this second division is capable of
considerable compression. The author frequently employs two
illustrations when one would suffice, and three or more when two
are enough. He discusses many themes which are not strictly
trinitarian.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p38">Yet the patient student will derive
some benefit from this discursiveness. He will find, for example,
in this treatise on the Trinity, an able examination of the subject
of miracles (Book III); of creation <i>ex nihilo</i> (III. ix); of
vicarious atonement (IV. vii-xiv); of the faculty of memory (XI.
x); and, incidentally, many other high themes are touched upon.
Before such a contemplative intellect as that of Augustin, all
truth lay spread out like the ocean, with no limits and no
separating chasms. Everything is connected and fluid. Consequently,
one doctrine inevitably leads to and merges in another, and the
eager and intense inquirer rushes forward, and outward, and upward,
and downward, in every direction. The only aim is to see all that
can be seen, and state all that can be stated. The neglect of the
form, and the anxiety after the substance, contribute to the
discursiveness. Caring little for proportion in method, and nothing
for elegance in diction, the writer, though bringing forth a vast
amount of truth, does it at the expense of clearness, conciseness,
and grace. Such is the case with the North African father&#8212;one of
the most voluminous and prolix of authors, yet one of the most
original, suggestive, and fertilizing of any.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p39">And this particular treatise is
perhaps as pregnant and suggestive as any that Augustin, or any
other theologian, ever composed. The doctrine of the Trinity is the
most <i>immense</i> of all the doctrines of religion. It is the
foundation of theology. Christianity, in the last analysis, is
Trinitarianism. Take out of the New Testament the persons of the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and there is no God left.
Take out of the Christian consciousness the thoughts and affections
that relate to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and there
is no Christian consciousness left. The Trinity is the constitutive
idea of the evangelical theology, and the formative idea of the
evangelical experience. The immensity of the doctrine makes it of
necessity a mystery; but a mystery which like night enfolds in its
unfathomed depths the bright stars&#8212;points of light, compared with
which there is no light so keen and so glittering. Mysterious as it
is, the Trinity of Divine Revelation is the doctrine that holds in
it all the hope of man; for it holds within it the infinite pity of
the Incarnation and the infinite mercy of the
Redemption.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p40">And it shares its mysteriousness
with the doctrine of the Divine Eternity. It is diffi<pb n="11" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_11.html" id="iv.i.i-Page_11"/>cult to say
which is most baffling to human comprehension, the
all-comprehending, simultaneous, successionless consciousness of
the Infinite One, or his trinal personality. Yet no theist rejects
the doctrine of the Divine eternity because of its mystery. The two
doctrines are antithetic and correlative. On one of the Northern
rivers that flows through a narrow chasm whose depth no plummet has
sounded, there stand two cliffs fronting each other, shooting their
pinnacles into the blue ether, and sending their roots down to the
foundations of the earth. They have named them Trinity and
Eternity. So stand, antithetic and confronting, in the Christian
scheme, the trinity and eternity of God.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p41">The translation of this treatise is
the work of the Rev. Arthur West Haddan, Hon. Canon of Worcester,
who, according to a note of the publisher, died while it was
passing through the press. It has been compared with the original,
and a considerable number of alterations made. The treatise is
exceedingly difficult to render into English&#8212;probably the most so
of any in the author&#8217;s writings. The changes in some instances
were necessary from a misconception of the original; but more often
for the purpose of making the meaning of the translator himself
more clear. It is believed that a comparison between the original
and revised translation will show that the latter is the more
intelligible. At the same time, the reviser would not be too
confident that in every instance the exact meaning of Augustin has
been expressed, by either the translator or reviser.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.i-p42">The annotations of the reviser upon
important points in the treatise, it is hoped, will assist the
reader in understanding Augustin&#8217;s reasoning, and also throw some
light upon the doctrine of the Trinity.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ii-p3"><span class="c9" id="iv.i.ii-p3.1">The</span> history
of St. Augustin&#8217;s treatise on the Trinity, as gathered by
Tillemont and others from his own allusions to it, may be briefly
given. It is placed by him in his <i>Retractations</i> among the
works written (which in the present case, it appears, must mean
begun) in <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.2">A.D.</span> 400. In letters of <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.3">A.D.</span> 410, 414, and at the end of <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.4">A.D.</span> 415 (<i>Ad Consentium</i>, <scripRef passage="Ep. 120" id="iv.i.ii-p3.5">Ep. 120</scripRef>, and two
<i>Ad Evodium</i>, Epp. 162, 169), it is referred to as still
unfinished and unpublished. But a letter of <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.6">
A.D.</span> 412 (<i>Ad Marcellinum</i>, <scripRef passage="Ep. 143" id="iv.i.ii-p3.7">Ep. 143</scripRef>) intimates that
friends were at that time importuning him, although without
success, to complete and publish it. And the letter to Aurelius,
which was sent to that bishop with the treatise itself when
actually completed, informs us that a portion of it, while it was
still unrevised and incomplete, was in fact surreptitiously made
public,&#8212;a proceeding which the letters above cited postpone
apparently until at least after <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.8">A.D.</span> 415.
It was certainly still in hand in <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.9">A.D.</span>
416, inasmuch as in Book XIII. a quotation occurs from the 12th
Book of the <i>De Civitate Dei</i>; and another quotation in Book
XV., from the 90th lecture on St. John, indicates most probably a
date of at least a year later, <i>viz</i>. <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.10">
A.D.</span> 417. The <i>Retractations</i>, which refer to it, are
usually dated not later than <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.11">A.D.</span> 428. The
letter to Bishop Aurelius also informs us that the work was many
years in progress, and was begun in St. Augustin&#8217;s early manhood,
and finished in his old age. We may infer from this evidence that
it was written by him between <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.12">A.D.</span> 400,
when he was forty-six years old, and had been Bishop of Hippo about
four years, and <span class="c19" id="iv.i.ii-p3.13">A.D.</span> 428 at the latest;
but probably it was published ten or twelve years before this date.
He writes of it, indeed, himself, as if the &#8220;<i>nonum prematur in
annum</i>&#8221; very inadequately represented the amount of deliberate
and patient thought which a subject so profound and so sacred
demanded, and which he had striven to give to it; and as if, even
at the very last, he shrank from publishing his work, and was only
driven to do so in order to remedy the mischief of its partial and
unauthorized publication.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ii-p4">His motive for writing on the
subject may be learned from the treatise itself. It was not
directed against any individual antagonist, or occasioned by any
particular controversial emergency. In fact, his labors upon it
were, he says, continually interrupted by the distraction of such
controversies. Certain ingenious and subtle theories respecting
types or resemblances of the Holy Trinity, traceable in human
nature as being the image of God, seemed to him to supply, not
indeed a logical proof, but a strong rational presumption, of the
truth of the doctrine itself; and thus to make it incumbent upon
him to expound and unfold them in order to meet rationalizing
objectors upon (so to say) their own ground. He is careful not to
deal with these analogies or images as if they either constituted a
purely argumentative proof or exhausted the full meaning of the
doctrine, upon both which assumptions such speculations have at all
times been the fruitful parent both of presumptious theorizing and
of grievous heresy. But he nevertheless employs them more
affirmatively than would perhaps have been the case. While modern
theologians would argue negatively, from the triplicity of
independent faculties,&#8212;united, nevertheless, in the unity of a
single human person,&#8212;that any presumption of reason against the
Trinity of persons in the Godhead is thereby, if not removed, at
least materially and enormously lessened, St. Augustin seems to
argue positively from analogous grounds, as though they constituted
a direct intimation of the doctrine itself. But he takes especial
pains, at the same time, to dwell upon the incapacity of human
thought to fathom the depths of the nature of God; and he carefully
prefaces his reasonings by a statement of the Scripture evidence of
the catholic doctrine as a matter of faith and not of reason, and
by an explanation of difficult texts upon the subject. One of the
most valuable portions, indeed, of the treatise is the eloquent and
profound exposition given in this part of it of the rule of
interpretation to be applied to Scripture language respecting the
person of our Lord. It should be noticed, however, that a large
proportion of St. Augustin&#8217;s scriptural exege<pb n="14" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_14.html" id="iv.i.ii-Page_14"/>sis is
founded upon a close verbal exposition of the old Latin version,
and is frequently not borne out by the original text. And the rule
followed in rendering Scripture texts in the present translation
has been, accordingly, wherever the argument in the context rests
upon the variations of the old Latin, there to translate the words
as St. Augustin gives them, while adhering otherwise to the
language of the authorized English version. The reader&#8217;s
attention may allowably be drawn to the language of Book V. c.x.,
and to its close resemblance to some of the most remarkable phrases
of the Athanasian Creed, and again to the striking passage
respecting miracles in Book III. c.v., and to that upon the nature
of God at the beginning of Book V.; the last named of which seems
to have suggested one of the profoundest passages in the
profoundest of Dr. Newman&#8217;s <i>University Sermons</i> (p. 353,
ed. 1843). It may be added, that the writings of the Greek Fathers
on the subject were, if not wholly unknown, yet unfamiliar to
Augustin, who quotes directly only the Latin work of Hilary of
Poictiers.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ii-p5">It remains to say, that the
translation here printed was made about four years since by a
friend of the writer of this preface, and that the latter&#8217;s share
in the work has been that of thoroughly revising and correcting it,
and of seeing it through the press. He is therefore answerable for
the work as now published.</p>

fifteen books concerning the Trinity, which is God. When, however,

had happened in the matter in some other work; but at the urgent
request of brethren, whom I could not refuse, I corrected it as
much as I thought fit, and finished and published it, with the
addition, at the beginning, of a letter that I had written to the
venerable Aurelius, Bishop of Carthage, in which I set forth, in
the way of prologue, what had happened, what I had intended to do
of myself, and what love of my brethren had forced me to
do.&#8221;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ii-p11">The letter to which he here alludes
is the following:&#8212;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ii-p12">&#8220;To the most blessed Lord, whom
he reveres with most sincere love, to his holy brother and
fellow-priest, Pope Aurelius, Augustin sends health in the
Lord.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ii-p13">&#8220;I began as a very young man, and
have published in my old age, some books concerning the Trinity,
who is the supreme and true God. I had in truth laid the work
aside, upon discovering that it had been prematurely, or rather
surreptitiously, stolen from me before I had completed it, and
before I had revised and put the finishing touches to it, as had
been my intention. For I had not designed to publish the Books one
by one, but all together, inasmuch as the progress of the inquiry
led me to add the later ones to those which precede them. When,
therefore, these people had hindered the fulfillment of my purpose
(in that some of them had obtained access to the work before I
intended), I had given over dictating it, with the idea of making
my complaint public in some other work that I might write, in order
that whoso could might know that the Books had not been published
by myself, but had been taken away from my possession before they
were in my own judgment fit for publication. Compelled, however, by
the eager demands of many of my brethren, and above all by your
command, I have taken the pains, by God&#8217;s help, to complete the
work, laborious as it is; and as now corrected (not as I wished,
but as I could, lest the Books should differ very widely from those
which had surreptitiously got into people&#8217;s hands), I have sent
them to your Reverence by my very dear son and fellow-deacon, and
have allowed them to be heard, copied, and read by every one that
pleases. Doubtless, if I could have fulfilled my original
intention, although they would have contained the same sentiments,
they would have been worked out much more thoroughly and clearly,
so far as the difficulty of unfolding so profound a subject, and so
far, too, as my own powers, might have allowed. There are some
persons, however, who have the first four, or rather five, Books
without the prefaces, and the twelfth with no small part of its
later chapters omitted. But these, if they please and can, will
amend the whole, if they become acquainted with the present
edition. At any rate, I have to request that you will order this
letter to be prefixed separately, but at the beginning of the
Books. Farewell. Pray for me.&#8221;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.i-p2">1. <span class="c19" id="iv.i.iii.i-p2.1">The</span>
following dissertation concerning the Trinity, as the reader ought
to be informed, has been written in order to guard against the
sophistries of those who disdain to begin with faith, and are
deceived by a crude and perverse love of reason. Now one class of
such men endeavor to transfer to things incorporeal and spiritual
the ideas they have formed, whether through experience of the
bodily senses, or by natural human wit and diligent quickness, or
by the aid of art, from things corporeal; so as to seek to measure
and conceive of the former by the latter. Others, again, frame
whatever sentiments they may have concerning God according to the
nature or affections of the human mind; and through this error they
govern their discourse, in disputing concerning God, by distorted
and fallacious rules. While yet a third class strive indeed to
transcend the whole creation, which doubtless is changeable, in
order to raise their thought to the unchangeable substance, which
is God; but being weighed down by the burden of mortality, whilst
they both would seem to know what they do not, and cannot know what
they would, preclude themselves from entering the very path of
understanding, by an over-bold affirmation of their own
presumptuous judgments; choosing rather not to correct their own
opinion when it is perverse, than to change that which they have
once defended. And, indeed, this is the common disease of all the
three classes which I have mentioned,&#8212;<i>viz.</i>, both of those
who frame their thoughts of God according to things corporeal, and
of those who do so according to the spiritual creature, such as is
the soul; and of those who neither regard the body nor the
spiritual creature, and yet think falsely about God; and are indeed
so much the further from the truth, that nothing can be found
answering to their conceptions, either in the body, or in the made
or created spirit, or in the Creator Himself. For he who thinks,
for instance, that God is white or red, is in error; and yet these
things are found in the body. Again, he who thinks of God as now
forgetting and now remembering, or anything of the same kind, is
none the less in error; and yet these things are found in the mind.
But he who thinks that God is of such power as to have generated
Himself, is so much the <pb n="18" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_18.html" id="iv.i.iii.i-Page_18"/>more in error, because not only
does God not so exist, but neither does the spiritual nor the
bodily creature; for there is nothing whatever that generates its
own existence.<note place="end" n="8" id="iv.i.iii.i-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.i-p3">
[Augustin here puts <i>generare</i> for <i>
creare</i>&#8212;which is rarely the case with him, since the
distinction between generation and creation is of the highest
importance in discussing the doctrine of the Trinity. His thought
here is, that God does not bring himself into being, because he
always is. Some have defined God as the Self-caused: <i>causa
sui</i>. But the category of cause and effect is inapplicable to
the Infinite Being.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.i-p4">2. In order, therefore, that the
human mind might be purged from falsities of this kind, Holy
Scripture, which suits itself to babes has not avoided words drawn
from any class of things really existing, through which, as by
nourishment, our understanding might rise gradually to things
divine and transcendent. For, in speaking of God, it has both used
words taken from things corporeal, as when it says, &#8220;Hide me
under the shadow of Thy wings;&#8221;<note place="end" n="9" id="iv.i.iii.i-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.i-p5">

and it has borrowed many things from the spiritual creature,
whereby to signify that which indeed is not so, but must needs so
be said: as, for instance, &#8220;I the Lord thy God am a jealous
God;&#8221;<note place="end" n="10" id="iv.i.iii.i-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.i-p6">

whereby to frame either figures of speech or enigmatic sayings,
from things which do not exist at all. And hence it is that they
who are shut out from the truth by that third kind of error are
more mischievously and emptily vain than their fellows; in that
they surmise respecting God, what can neither be found in Himself
nor in any creature. For divine Scripture is wont to frame, as it
were, allurements for children from the things which are found in
the creature; whereby, according to their measure, and as it were
by steps, the affections of the weak may be moved to seek those
things that are above, and to leave those things that are below.
But the same Scripture rarely employs those things which are spoken
properly of God, and are not found in any creature; as, for
instance, that which was said to Moses, &#8220;I am that I am;&#8221; and,
&#8220;I Am hath sent me to you.&#8221;<note place="end" n="12" id="iv.i.iii.i-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.i-p8">

For since both body and soul also are said in some sense to <i>
be</i>, Holy Scripture certainly would not so express itself unless
it meant to be understood in some special sense of the term. So,
too, that which the Apostle says, &#8220;Who only hath
immortality.&#8221;<note place="end" n="13" id="iv.i.iii.i-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.i-p9">

also both is said to be, and is, in a certain manner immortal,
Scripture would not say &#8220;only hath,&#8221; unless because true
immortality is unchangeableness; which no creature can possess,
since it belongs to the creator alone.<note place="end" n="14" id="iv.i.iii.i-p9.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.i-p10">
[God&#8217;s being is necessary; that of the creature
is contingent. Hence the name I Am, or Jehovah,&#8212;which denotes
this difference. God alone has immortality a <i>parte ante</i>, as
well as a <i>parte post</i>.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> So also James says, &#8220;Every good
gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the
Father of Lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of
turning.&#8221;<note place="end" n="15" id="iv.i.iii.i-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.i-p11">

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.i-p13">3. Further, it is difficult to
contemplate and fully know the substance of God; who fashions
things changeable, yet without any change in Himself, and creates
things temporal, yet without any temporal movement in Himself. And
it is necessary, therefore, to purge our minds, in order to be able
to see ineffably that which is ineffable; whereto not having yet
attained, we are to be nourished by faith, and led by such ways as
are more suited to our capacity, that we may be rendered apt and
able to comprehend it. And hence the Apostle says, that &#8220;in
Christ indeed are hid all the treasures of wisdom and

commended Him to us, as to babes in Christ, who, although already
born again by His grace, yet are still carnal and psychical, not by
that divine virtue wherein He is equal to the Father, but by that
human infirmity whereby He was crucified. For he says, &#8220;I

continues, &#8220;And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in
much trembling.&#8221; And a little after he says to them, &#8220;And I,

however, belong to the <i>class</i> of carnal or natural men, in

sometimes, indeed, we do allege to them, not certainly that account
of the case which they seek in their inquiries about God,&#8212;because
neither can they themselves receive it, nor can we perhaps either
apprehend or express it,&#8212;but such an account of it as to
demonstrate to them how incapable and utterly unfit they are to
understand that which they require of us. But they, on their parts,
because <pb n="19" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_19.html" id="iv.i.iii.i-Page_19"/>they do not hear what they desire, think that we are

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.ii-p2">4. Wherefore, our Lord God helping,
we will undertake to render, as far as we are able, that very
account which they so importunately demand: <i>viz</i>., that the
Trinity is the one and only and true God, and also how the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit are rightly said, believed,
understood, to be of one and the same substance or essence; in such
wise that they may not fancy themselves mocked by excuses on our
part, but may find by actual trial, both that the highest good is
that which is discerned by the most purified minds, and that for
this reason it cannot be discerned or understood by themselves,
because the eye of the human mind, being weak, is dazzled in that
so transcendent light, unless it be invigorated by the nourishment
of the righteousness of faith. First, however, we must demonstrate,
according to the authority of the Holy Scriptures, whether the
faith be so. Then, if God be willing and aid us, we may perhaps at
least so far serve these talkative arguers&#8212;more puffed up than
capable, and therefore laboring under the more dangerous
disease&#8212;as to enable them to find something which they are not
able to doubt, that so, in that case where they cannot find the
like, they may be led to lay the fault to their own minds, rather
than to the truth itself or to our reasonings; and thus, if there
be anything in them of either love or fear towards God, they may
return and begin from faith in due order: perceiving at length how
healthful a medicine has been provided for the faithful in the holy
Church, whereby a heedful piety, healing the feebleness of the
mind, may render it able to perceive the unchangeable truth, and
hinder it from falling headlong, through disorderly rashness, into
pestilent and false opinion. Neither will I myself shrink from
inquiry, if I am anywhere in doubt; nor be ashamed to learn, if I
am anywhere in error.</p>

with me in inquiring; wherever he recognizes himself to be in
error, there to return to me; wherever he recognizes me to be so,

make this pious and safe agreement, in the presence of our Lord
God, with all who read my writings, as well in all other cases as,
above all, in the case of those which inquire into the unity of the
Trinity, of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit; because in
no other subject is error more dangerous, or inquiry more
laborious, or the discovery of truth more profitable. If, then, any
reader shall say, This is not well said, because I do not
understand it; such an one finds fault with my language, not with
my faith: and it might perhaps in very truth have been put more
clearly; yet no man ever so spoke as to be understood in all things
by all men. Let him, therefore, who finds this fault with my
discourse, see whether he can understand other men who have handled
similar subjects and questions, when he does not understand me: and
if he can, let him put down my book, or even, if he pleases, throw
it away; and let him spend labor and time rather on those whom he
understands.<note place="end" n="22" id="iv.i.iii.iii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.iii-p4">
[This request of Augustin to his reader, involves
an admirable rule for authorship generally&#8212;the desire, namely,
that truth be attained, be it through himself or through others.
Milton teaches the same, when he says that the author must &#8220;study
and love learning for itself, not for lucre, or any other end, but
the service of God and of truth, and perhaps that lasting fame and
perpetuity of praise, which God and good men have consented shall
be the reward of those whose published labors advance the good of
mankind.&#8221;&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> Yet let him
not think on that account that I ought to have been silent, because
I have not been able to express myself so smoothly and clearly to
him as those do whom he understands. For neither do all things,
which all men have written, come into the hands of all. And
possibly some, who are capable of understanding even these our
writings, may not find those more lucid works, and may meet with
ours only. And therefore it is useful that many persons should
write many books, differing in style but not in faith, concerning
even the same questions, that the matter itself may reach the
greatest number&#8212;some in one way, some in another. But if he who
complains that he has not understood these things has never been
able to comprehend any careful and exact reasonings at all upon
such subjects, let him in that case deal with himself by resolution
and study, that he may <pb n="20" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_20.html" id="iv.i.iii.iii-Page_20"/>know better; not with me by
quarrellings and wranglings, that I may hold my peace. Let him,
again, who says, when he reads my book, Certainly I understand what
is said, but it is not true, assert, if he pleases, his own
opinion, and refute mine if he is able. And if he do this with
charity and truth, and take the pains to make it known to me (if I
am still alive), I shall then receive the most abundant fruit of
this my labor. And if he cannot inform myself, most willing and
glad should I be that he should inform those whom he can. Yet, for

seeing that neither can any one, in any way, rightly ascribe the
numerous and various errors of heretics to the holy testimonies
themselves of the divine books; although all of them endeavor to
defend out of those same Scriptures their own false and erroneous
opinions. The law of Christ, that is, charity, admonishes me
clearly, and commands me with a sweet constraint, that when men
think that I have held in my books something false which I have not
held, and that same falsehood displeases one and pleases another, I
should prefer to be blamed by him who reprehends the falsehood,
rather than praised by him who praises it. For although I, who
never held the error, am not rightly blamed by the former, yet the
error itself is rightly censured; whilst by the latter neither am I
rightly praised, who am thought to have held that which the truth
censures, nor the sentiment itself, which the truth also censures.
Let us therefore essay the work which we have undertaken in the
name of the Lord.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.iv-p2">7. All those Catholic expounders of
the divine Scriptures, both Old and New, whom I have been able to
read, who have written before me concerning the Trinity, Who is
God, have purposed to teach, according to the Scriptures, this
doctrine, that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit
intimate a divine unity of one and the same substance in an
indivisible equality;<note place="end" n="25" id="iv.i.iii.iv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.iv-p3">
[Augustin teaches the Nicene doctrine of a
numerical unity of essence in distinction from a specific unity.
The latter is that of mankind. In this case there is <i>
division</i> of substance&#8212;part after part of the specific nature
being separated and formed, by propagation, into individuals. No
human individual contains the whole specific nature. But in the
case of the numerical unity of the Trinity, there is no division of
essence. The whole divine nature is in each divine person. The
three divine persons do not constitute a species&#8212;that is, three
divine individuals made by the division and distribution of one
common divine nature&#8212;but are three modes or &#8220;forms&#8221;

and therefore that they are not three Gods, but one God: although
the Father hath begotten the Son, and so He who is the Father is
not the Son; and the Son is begotten by the Father, and so He who
is the Son is not the Father; and the Holy Spirit is neither the
Father nor the Son, but only the Spirit of the Father and of the
Son, Himself also co-equal with the Father and the Son, and
pertaining to the unity of the Trinity. Yet not that this Trinity

[The term Trinity denotes the Divine essence in
all three modes. The term Father (or Son, or Spirit) denotes the
essence in only one mode. Consequently, there is something in the
Trinity that cannot be attributed to any one of the Persons, as

Trinity, as such. Trinality cannot be ascribed to the first Person;
paternity cannot be ascribed to the Trinity.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note>

What Manner Three are One God, and How, Working Indivisibly, They
Yet Perform Some Things Severally.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.v-p2">8. Some persons, however, find a
difficulty in this faith; when they hear that the Father is God,
and the Son God, and the Holy Spirit God, and yet that this Trinity
is not three Gods, but one God; and they ask how they are to
understand this: especially when it is said that the Trinity works
indivisibly in everything that God works, and yet that a certain
voice of the Father spoke, which is not the voice of the Son; and
that none except the Son was born in the flesh, and suffered, and
rose again, and ascended into heaven; and that none except the Holy
Spirit came in the form of a dove. They wish to understand how the
Trinity uttered that voice which was only of the Father; and how
the same Trinity created that flesh in which the Son only was born
of the Virgin; and how the very same Trinity itself wrought that
form of a dove, in which the Holy Spirit only appeared. Yet,
otherwise, the Trinity does not work indivisibly, but the Father
does some things, the Son other things, and the Holy Spirit yet
others: or else, if they do some things together, some severally,
then the Trinity is not indivisible. It is a difficulty, too, to
them, in what manner the Holy Spirit is in the Trinity, whom
neither the Father nor the Son, nor both, have begotten, although
He is the Spirit both of the Father and of the Son. Since, then,
men weary us with asking such questions, let us unfold to them, as
we are able, whatever wisdom God&#8217;s gift has bestowed upon our
weakness on this subject; neither &#8220;let us go on our way with

and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; For it is plain
that we are to take the Word of God to be the only Son of God, of
whom it is afterwards said, &#8220;And the Word was made flesh, and
dwelt among us,&#8221; on account of that birth of His incarnation,
which was wrought in time of the Virgin. But herein is declared,
not only that He is God, but also that He is of the same substance
with the Father; because, after saying, &#8220;And the Word was God,&#8221;
it is said also, &#8220;The same was in the beginning with God: all

and if He is a substance that was made, then all things were not
made by Him; but &#8220;all things were made by Him,&#8221; therefore He is
of one and the same substance with the Father. And so He is not
only God, but also very God. And the same John most expressly
affirms this in his epistle: &#8220;For we know that the Son of God is
come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know the true
God, and that we may be in His true Son Jesus Christ. This is the

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.vi-p6">10. Hence also it follows by
consequence, that the Apostle Paul did not say, &#8220;Who alone has
immortality,&#8221; of the Father merely; but of the One and only God,
which is the Trinity itself. For that which is itself eternal life
is not mortal according to any changeableness; and hence the Son of
God, because &#8220;He is Eternal Life,&#8221; is also Himself understood
with the Father, where it is said, &#8220;Who only hath immortality.&#8221;
For we, too, are made partakers of this eternal life, and become,
in our own measure, immortal. But the eternal life itself, of which
we are made partakers, is one thing; we ourselves, who, by
partaking of it, shall live eternally, are another. For if He had
said, &#8220;Whom in His own time the Father will show, who is the
blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
who only hath immortality;&#8221; not even so would it be necessarily
understood that the Son is excluded. For neither has the Son
separated the Father from Himself, because He Himself, speaking
elsewhere with the voice of wisdom (for He Himself is the Wisdom of
God),<note place="end" n="37" id="iv.i.iii.vi-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.vi-p7">

not necessary that the words, &#8220;Who hath immortality,&#8221; should be
understood of the Father alone, omitting the Son; when they are
said thus: &#8220;That thou keep this commandment without spot,
unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: whom in
His own time He will show, who is the blessed and only Potentate,

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.vi-p10">11. But perhaps what follows may
interfere with this meaning; because it is said, &#8220;Whom no man
hath seen, nor can see:&#8221; although this may also be taken as
belonging to Christ according to His divinity, which the Jews did
not see, who yet saw and crucified Him in the flesh; whereas His
divinity can in no wise be seen by human sight, but is seen with
that sight with which they who see are no longer men, but beyond
men. Rightly, therefore, is God Himself, the Trinity, understood to

is anarthrous in the text: <i>a</i> form, not <i>the</i> form, as
the A.V and R.V. render. St. Paul refers to one of three
&#8220;forms&#8221; of God&#8212;namely, that particular form of Sonship, which
is peculiar to the second person of the Godhead. Had the apostle
employed the article with <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.iii.vi-p21.6">
&#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#8134;</span>, the implication would
be that there is only one &#8220;form of God&#8221;&#8212;that is, only one
person in the Divine Essence.</p>

that the Logos subsisted &#8220;in a form of the <i>Father</i>,&#8221;
which would imply that the Father had more than one &#8220;form,&#8221; or
else (if <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.iii.vi-p22.2">
&#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#8134;</span> be rendered with the
article) that the Logos subsisted in the &#8220;form&#8221; of the Father,
neither of which is true. But if &#8220;God,&#8221; in this place, denotes
the Divine Essence, then St. Paul teaches that the unincarnate
Logos subsisted in a particular &#8220;form&#8221; of the Essence&#8212;the
Father and Spirit subsisting in other &#8220;forms&#8221; of it.</p>

that Augustin is careful to teach that the Logos, when he took on

of the divine Scriptures, by free use of which, as I have said, our
predecessors exploded such sophistries or errors of the heretics,
the unity and equality of the Trinity are intimated to our faith.
But because, on account of the incarnation of the Word of God for
the working out of our salvation, that the man Christ Jesus might
be the Mediator between God and men,<note place="end" n="57" id="iv.i.iii.vii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.vii-p3">

sacred books as to signify, or even most expressly declare, the
Father to be greater than the Son; men have erred through a want of
careful examination or consideration of the whole tenor of the
Scriptures, and have endeavored to transfer those things which are
said of Jesus Christ according to the flesh, to that substance of
His which was eternal before the incarnation, and is eternal. They
say, for instance, that the Son is less than the Father, because it
is written that the Lord Himself said, &#8220;My Father is greater than
I.&#8221;<note place="end" n="58" id="iv.i.iii.vii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.vii-p4">

shows that after the same sense the Son is less also than Himself;
for how was He not made less also than Himself, who &#8220;emptied<note place="end" n="59" id="iv.i.iii.vii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.vii-p5">
<i>Exinanivit</i></p></note> Himself, and took upon Him the form
of a servant?&#8221; For He did not so take the form of a servant as
that He should lose the form of God, in which He was equal to the
Father. If, then, the form of a servant was so taken that the form
of God was not lost, since both in the form of a servant and in the
form of God He Himself is the same only-begotten Son of God the
Father, in the form of God equal to the Father, in the form of a
servant the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; is
there any one who cannot perceive that He Himself in the form of
God is also greater than Himself, but yet likewise in the form of a
servant less than Himself? And not, therefore, without cause the
Scripture says both the one and the other, both that the Son is
equal to the Father, and that the Father is greater than the Son.
For there is no confusion when the former is understood as on
account of the form of God, and the latter as on account of the
form of a servant. And, in truth, this rule for clearing the
question through all the sacred Scriptures is set forth in one
chapter of an epistle of the Apostle Paul, where this distinction
is commended to us plainly enough. For he says, &#8220;Who, being in
the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but
emptied Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was
made in the likeness of men: and was found in fashion<note place="end" n="60" id="iv.i.iii.vii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.vii-p6">

He made man; in the form of a servant He was made man. For if the

because the form of God took the form of a servant, both is God and
both is man; but both God, on account of God who takes; and both
man, on account of man who is taken. For neither by that taking is
the one of them turned and changed into the other: the Divinity is
not changed into the creature, so as to cease to be Divinity; nor
the creature into Divinity, so as to cease to be

&#8220;subjection&#8221; to be a change and conversion hereafter of the
creature into the substance or essence itself of the Creator, that
is, that that which had been the substance of a creature shall
become the substance of the Creator;&#8212;such an one at any rate
admits this, of which in truth there is no possible doubt, that
this had not yet taken place, when the Lord said, &#8220;My Father is
greater than I.&#8221; For He said this not only before He ascended
into heaven, but also before He had suffered, and had risen from
the dead. But they who think that the human nature in Him is to be
changed and converted into the substance of the Godhead, and that
it was so said, &#8220;Then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto
Him that put all things under Him,&#8221;&#8212;as if to say, Then also the
Son of man Himself, and the human nature taken by the Word of God,

the day of judgment, &#8220;He shall have delivered up the kingdom to
God, even the Father.&#8221; And hence even still, according to this
opinion, the Father is greater than that form of a servant which
was taken of the Virgin. But if some affirm even further, that the
man Christ Jesus has already been changed into the substance of
God, at least they cannot deny that the human nature still

to whom in the form of God the Son is equal. Nor let any one,

[The common explanation is better, which regards
the &#8220;kingdom&#8221; that is to be delivered up, to be the mediatorial
commission. When Christ shall have finished his work of redeeming
men, he no longer discharges the office of a mediator. It seems
incongruous to denominate the beatific vision of God by the
redeemed, a surrender of a kingdom. In I. x. 21, Augustin says that
when the Redeemer brings the redeemed from faith to sight, &#8220;He is
said to &#8216;deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father.&#8217;

For to have the fruition of God the Trinity, after whose image we
are made, is indeed the fullness of our joy, than which there is no

suffice, because He cannot be divided from the Father and the Son;
as the Father alone is sufficient, because He cannot be divided
from the Son and the Holy Spirit; and the Son alone is sufficient

which sufficeth us might be attained there. Sometimes also it is
said of the Son alone, that He himself sufficeth, and the whole
reward of our love and longing is held forth as in the sight of
Him. For so it is said, &#8220;He that hath my commandments, and

the Son is manifested, the Father also, who is in Him, is

of this joy; resting as she did from all business, and intent upon
the truth, according to that manner of which this life is capable,

For while Martha, her sister, was cumbered about necessary
business, which, although good and useful, yet, when rest shall
have succeeded, is to pass away, she herself was resting in the
word of the Lord. And so the Lord replied to Martha, when she
complained that her sister did not help her: &#8220;Mary hath chosen

therefore, God will be all in all; because nothing else but Himself

thought worthy of being brought by faith to sight, that is, to that
very sight, in bringing them to which He is said to &#8220;deliver up
the kingdom to God, even the Father.&#8221; For His faithful ones, whom
He has redeemed with His blood, are called His kingdom, for whom He
now intercedes; but then, making them to abide in Himself there,
where He is equal to the Father, He will no longer pray the Father

For indeed He &#8220;prays,&#8221; in so far as He is less than the Father;
but as He is equal with the Father, He with the Father grants.
Wherefore He certainly does not exclude Himself from that which He
says, &#8220;The Father Himself loveth you;&#8221; but He means it to be
understood after that manner which I have above spoken of, and
sufficiently intimated,&#8212;namely, that for the most part each
Person of the Trinity is so named, that the other Persons also may
be understood. Accordingly, &#8220;For the Father Himself loveth
you,&#8221; is so said that by consequence both the Son and the Holy
Spirit also may be understood: not that He does not now love us,

loves us, such as we shall be, not such as we are, for such as they
are whom He loves, such are they whom He keeps eternally; which
shall then be, when He who now maketh intercession for us shall
have &#8220;delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father,&#8221; so as
no longer to ask the Father, because the Father Himself loveth us.
But for what deserving, except of faith, by which we believe before
we see that which is promised? For by this faith we shall arrive at
sight; so that He may love us, being such, as He loves us in order
that we may become; and not such, as He hates us because we are,
and exhorts and enables us to wish not to be always.</p>

therefore, He has also glorified those whom He has justified, He
who justifies, Himself also glorifies; who is, as I have said, the

to His disciples, when inquiring about their own glorification:
&#8220;To sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give, but
[it shall be given to them] for whom it is prepared by my

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p26">25. But that which is prepared by

already shown, by many modes of speech in the divine Scriptures,
that, in this Trinity, what is said of each is also said of all, on
account of the indivisible working of the one and same substance.

say, <i>We</i> will send; but in such way as if the Son only should
send Him, and not the Father; while yet He says in another place,
&#8220;These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you;
but the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
send in my name, He shall teach you all things.&#8221;<note place="end" n="160" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p28.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p29"> <scripRef passage="John xiv. 25, 26" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p29.2" parsed="|John|14|25|14|26" osisRef="Bible:John.14.25-John.14.26">John xiv. 25, 26</scripRef></p></note> Here again
it is so said as if the Son also would not send Him, but the Father
only. As therefore in these texts, so also where He says, &#8220;But
for them for whom it is prepared by my Father,&#8221; He meant it to be
understood that He Himself, with the Father, prepares seats of
glory for those for whom He will. But some one may say: There, when
He spoke of the Holy Spirit, He so says that He Himself will send
Him, as not to deny that the Father will send Him; and in the other
place, He so says that the Father will send Him, as not to deny
that He will do so Himself; but here He expressly says, &#8220;It is
not mine to give,&#8221; and so goes on to say that these things are
prepared by the Father. But this is the very thing which we have
already laid down to be said according to the form of a servant:
<i>viz.</i>, that we are so to understand &#8220;It is not mine to
give,&#8221; as if it were said, This is not in the power of man to
give; that so He may be understood to give it through that wherein
He is God equal to the Father. &#8220;It is not mine,&#8221; He says, &#8220;to
give;&#8221; that is, I do not give these things by human power, but
&#8220;to those for whom it is prepared by my Father;&#8221; but then take
care you understand also, that if &#8220;all things which the Father
hath are mine,&#8221;<note place="end" n="161" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p29.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p30"> <scripRef passage="John xvi. 15" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p30.2" parsed="|John|16|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.16.15">John xvi. 15</scripRef></p></note> then this
certainly is mine also, and I with the Father have prepared these
things.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p31">26. For I ask again, in what manner
this is said, &#8220;If any man hear not my words, I will not judge
him?&#8221;<note place="end" n="162" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p32"> <scripRef passage="John xii. 47-50" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p32.2" parsed="|John|12|47|12|50" osisRef="Bible:John.12.47-John.12.50">John xii. 47&#8211;50</scripRef></p></note> For perhaps
He has said here, &#8220;I will not judge him,&#8221; in the same sense as
there, &#8220;It is not mine to give.&#8221; But what follows here? &#8220;I
came not,&#8221; He says, &#8220;to judge the world, but to save the
world;&#8221; and then He adds, &#8220;He that rejecteth me, and receiveth
not my words, hath one that judgeth him.&#8221; Now here we should
understand the Father, unless He had added, &#8220;The word that I have
spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.&#8221; Well, then,
will neither the Son judge, because He says, &#8220;I will not judge
him,&#8221; nor the Father, but the word which the Son hath spoken?
Nay, <pb n="32" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_32.html" id="iv.i.iii.xii-Page_32"/>but hear what yet follows: &#8220;For I,&#8221; He says, &#8220;have
not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, He gave me a
commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak; and I know
that His commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak
therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.&#8221; If
therefore the Son judges not, but &#8220;the word which the Son hath
spoken;&#8221; and the word which the Son hath spoken therefore judges,
because the Son &#8220;hath not spoken of Himself, but the Father who
sent Him gave Him a commandment what He should say, and what He
should speak:&#8221; then the Father assuredly judges, whose word it is
which the Son hath spoken; and the same Son Himself is the very
Word of the Father. For the commandment of the Father is not one
thing, and the word of the Father another; for He hath called it
both a word and a commandment. Let us see, therefore, whether
perchance, when He says, &#8220;I have not spoken of myself,&#8221; He
meant to be understood thus,&#8212;I am not born of myself. For if He
speaks the word of the Father, then He speaks Himself,<note place="end" n="163" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p32.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p33"> <i>Seipsum
loquitur</i></p></note> because He
is Himself the Word of the Father. For ordinarily He says, &#8220;The
Father gave to me;&#8221; by which He means it to be understood that
the Father begat Him: not that He gave anything to Him, already
existing and not possessing it; but that the very meaning of, To
have given that He might have, is, To have begotten that He might
be. For it is not, as with the creature so with the Son of God
before the incarnation and before He took upon Him our flesh, the
Only-begotten by whom all things were made; that He <i>is</i> one
thing, and has another: but He <i>is</i> in such way as to <i>
be</i> what He <i>has</i>. And this is said more plainly, if any
one is fit to receive it, in that place where He says: &#8220;For as
the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to
have life in Himself.&#8221;<note place="end" n="164" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p34"> <scripRef passage="John v. 26" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p34.2" parsed="|John|5|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.26">John v. 26</scripRef></p></note> For He did not give to Him, already
existing and not having life, that He should have life in Himself;
inasmuch as, in that He <i>is</i>, He is life. Therefore &#8220;He gave
to the Son to have life in Himself&#8221; means, He begat the Son to be
unchangeable life, which is life eternal. Since, therefore, the
Word of God is the Son of God, and the Son of God is &#8220;the true
God and eternal life,&#8221;<note place="end" n="165" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p34.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p35"> <scripRef passage="1 John v. 20" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p35.2" parsed="|1John|5|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.5.20">1 John v. 20</scripRef></p></note> as John says in his Epistle; so
here, what else are we to acknowledge when the Lord says, &#8220;The

day,&#8221;<note place="end" n="166" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p35.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p36"> <scripRef passage="John xii. 48" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p36.2" parsed="|John|12|48|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.12.48">John xii. 48</scripRef></p></note> and calls
that very word the word of the Father and the commandment of the
Father, and that very commandment everlasting life?&#8221; &#8220;And I
know,&#8221; He says, &#8220;that His commandment is life
everlasting.&#8221;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p37">27. I ask, therefore, how we are to
understand, &#8220;I will not judge him; but the Word which I have
spoken shall judge him:&#8221; which appears from what follows to be so
said, as if He would say, I will not judge; but the Word of the
Father will judge. But the Word of the Father is the Son of God
Himself. Is it to be so understood: I will not judge, but I will
judge? How can this be true, unless in this way: <i>viz</i>., I
will not judge by human power, because I am the Son of man; but I
will judge by the power of the Word, because I am the Son of God?
Or if it still seems contradictory and inconsistent to say, I will
not judge, but I will judge; what shall we say of that place where
He says, &#8220;My doctrine is not mine?&#8221; How &#8220;mine,&#8221; when &#8220;not
mine?&#8221; For He did not say, <i>This</i> doctrine is not mine, but
&#8220;<i>My</i> doctrine is not mine:&#8221; that which He called His own,
the same He called not His own. How can this be true, unless He has
called it His own in one relation; not His own, in another?
According to the form of God, His own; according to the form of a
servant, not His own. For when He says, &#8220;It is not mine, but His
that sent me,&#8221;<note place="end" n="167" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p38"> <scripRef passage="John vii. 16" id="iv.i.iii.xii-p38.2" parsed="|John|7|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.7.16">John vii. 16</scripRef></p></note> He makes us

contemplate Himself as equal to the Father? So that in turning the
attention of believers to the Father, and saying, &#8220;Believeth not
on me, but on Him that sent me,&#8221; He certainly did not mean
Himself to be separated from the Father, that is, from Him that
sent Him; but that men might so believe on Himself, as they believe
on the Father, to whom He is equal. And this He says in express

Himself; so also, when He says, &#8220;It is not mine to give, but [it

the human nature, but the whole divine-human person under a human
title. Strictly used, the phrase &#8220;Son of man&#8221; does not
designate the difference between the divine and human natures in
the theanthropos, but between the person of the <i>un</i>-incarnate
and that of the incarnate Logos. Augustin&#8217;s meaning is, that the
Son of God will judge men at the last day, not in his original

judgeth no man.&#8221; For in respect to this, that the Father hath
begotten the Son equal to Himself, He judges with Him. Therefore it
is in respect to this that it is said, that in the judgment, not
the form of God, but the form of the Son of man will appear. Not
that He will not judge, who hath committed all judgment unto the
Son, since the Son saith of Him, &#8220;There is One that seeketh and
judgeth:&#8221; but it is so said, &#8220;The Father judgeth no man, but
hath committed all judgment unto the Son;&#8221; as if it were said, No
one will see the Father in the judgment of the quick and the dead,

that He can be seen even by the ungodly, since they too shall see
Him whom they have pierced.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p17">30. Lest, however, we may seem to
conjecture this rather than to prove it clearly, let us produce a
certain and plain sentence of the Lord Himself, by which we may
show that this was the cause why He said, &#8220;The Father judgeth no
man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son,&#8221; <i>viz</i>.
because He will appear as Judge in the form of the Son of man,
which is not the form of the Father, but of the Son; nor yet that
form of the Son in which He is equal to the Father, but that in
which He is less than the Father; in order that, in the judgment,
He may be visible both to the good and to the bad. For a little
while after He says, &#8220;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that
heareth my word, and believeth on Him that sent me, hath
everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but shall
pass<note place="end" n="184" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p18"> Transi<i>it</i> in Vulg.; and so
in the Greek.</p></note> from death
unto life.&#8221; Now this life eternal is that sight which does not
belong to the bad. Then follows, &#8220;Verily, verily, I say unto you,
The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice
of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.&#8221;<note place="end" n="185" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p19"> <scripRef passage="John v. 24, 25" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p19.2" parsed="|John|5|24|5|25" osisRef="Bible:John.5.24-John.5.25">John v. 24, 25</scripRef></p></note> And this is
proper to the godly, who so hear of His incarnation, as to believe
that He is the Son of God, that is, who so receive Him, as made for
their sakes less than the Father, in the form of a servant, that
they believe Him equal to the Father, in the form of God. And
thereupon He continues, enforcing this very point, &#8220;For as the
Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have
life in Himself.&#8221; And then He comes to the sight of His own
glory, in which He shall come to judgment; which sight will be
common to the ungodly and to the just. For He goes on to say,
&#8220;And hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because
He is the Son of man.&#8221;<note place="end" n="186" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p19.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p20"> <scripRef passage="John v. 25, 26" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p20.2" parsed="|John|5|25|5|26" osisRef="Bible:John.5.25-John.5.26">John v. 25, 26</scripRef></p></note> I think nothing can be more clear.
For inasmuch as the Son of God is equal to the Father, He does not
receive this power of executing judgment, but He has it with the
Father in secret; but He receives it, so that the good and the bad
may see Him judging, inasmuch as He is the Son of man. Since the
sight of the Son of man will be shown to the bad also: for the
sight of the form of God will not be shown except to the pure in
heart, for they shall see God; that is, to the godly only, to whose
love He promises this very thing, that He will show Himself to
them. And see, accordingly, what follows: &#8220;Marvel not at this,&#8221;
He says. Why does He forbid us to marvel, unless it be that, in
truth, every one marvels who does not understand, that therefore He
said the Father gave Him power also to execute judgment, because He
is the Son of man; whereas, it might rather have been anticipated
that He would say, since He is the Son of God? But because the
wicked are not able to see the Son of God as He is in the form of
God equal to the Father, <pb n="35" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_35.html" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-Page_35"/>but yet it is necessary that
both the just and the wicked should see the Judge of the quick and
dead, when they will be judged in His presence; &#8220;Marvel not at
this,&#8221; He says, &#8220;for the hour is coming, in the which all that
are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they
that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that
have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.&#8221;<note place="end" n="187" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p20.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p21"> <scripRef passage="John v. 22-29" id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p21.2" parsed="|John|5|22|5|29" osisRef="Bible:John.5.22-John.5.29">John v. 22&#8211;29</scripRef></p></note> For this
purpose, then, it was necessary that He should therefore receive
that power, because He is the Son of man, in order that all in

all, but by some to damnation, by others to life eternal. And what
is life eternal, unless that sight which is not granted to the
ungodly? &#8220;That they might know Thee,&#8221; He says, &#8220;the One true

demonstrates that He who is sent is not therefore less than He who

unchangeable and invisible and omnipresent, works indivisibly in

they must, by experience, the wearisome difficulties of the task,
whether from the sight itself of the mind striving to gaze upon

modes of speech employed in the sacred writings (wherein, as it
seems to me, the mind is nothing else but roughly exercised, in
order that it may find sweetness when glorified by the grace of
Christ);&#8212;such men, I say, when they have dispelled every
ambiguity, and arrived at something certain, ought of all others
most easily to make allowance for those who err in the
investigation of so deep a secret. But there are two things most
hard to bear with, in the case of those who are in error: hasty
assumption before the truth is made plain; and, when it has been
made plain, defence of the falsehood thus hastily assumed. From
which two faults, inimical as they are to the finding out of the

grace of His mercy, I will not be slow to search out the substance
of God, whether through His Scripture or through the creature. For
both of these are set forth for our contemplation to this end, that
He may Himself be sought, and Himself be loved, who inspired the
one, and created the other. Nor shall I be afraid of giving my
opinion, in which I shall more desire to be examined by the
upright, than fear to be carped at by the perverse. For charity,
most excellent and unassuming, gratefully accepts the dovelike eye;
but for the dog&#8217;s tooth nothing remains, save either to shun it
by the most cautious humility, or to blunt it by the most solid
truth; and far rather would I be censured by any one whatsoever,
than be praised by either the erring or the flatterer. For the
lover of truth need fear no one&#8217;s censure. For he that censures,
must needs be either enemy or friend. And if an enemy reviles, he
must be borne with: but a friend, if he errs, must be taught; if he
teaches, listened to. But if one who errs praises you, he confirms
your error; if one who flatters, he seduces you into error. &#8220;Let

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iv.ii-p2">2. Wherefore, although we hold most
firmly, concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, what may be called the
canonical rule, as it is both disseminated through the Scriptures,
and has been demonstrated by learned and Catholic handlers of the
same Scriptures, namely, that the Son of God is both
under<pb n="38" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_38.html" id="iv.i.iv.ii-Page_38"/>stood to be equal to the Father according to the form of

not only less than the Father, but also less than the Holy Spirit;
and not only so, but less even than Himself,&#8212;not than Himself who
was, but than Himself who is; because, by taking the form of a
servant, He did not lose the form of God, as the testimonies of the
Scriptures taught us, to which we have referred in the former book:
yet there are some things in the sacred text so put as to leave it
ambiguous to which rule they are rather to be referred; whether to
that by which we understand the Son as less, in that He has taken
upon Him the creature, or to that by which we understand that the
Son is not indeed less than, but equal to the Father, but yet that
He is from Him, God of God, Light of light. For we call the Son God
<i>of</i> God; but the Father, God only; not <i>of</i> God. Whence
it is plain that the Son has another <i>of</i> whom He is, and to
whom He is Son; but that the Father has not a Son <i>of</i> whom He
is, but only to whom He is father. For every son is what he is, <i>
of</i> his father, and is son to his father; but no father is what
he is, <i>of</i> his son, but is father to his son.<note place="end" n="212" id="iv.i.iv.ii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.ii-p4"> [Augustin here brings to view both
the trinitarian and the theanthropic or mediatorial subordination.
The former is the status of Sonship. God the Son is God <i>of</i>
God. Sonship as a <i>relation</i> is subordinate to paternity. But
a son must be of the same grade of being, and of the same nature
with his father. A human son and a human father are alike and
equally <i>human</i>. And a Divine Son and a Divine father are
alike and equally <i>divine</i>. The theanthropic or mediatorial
subordination is the status of humiliation, by reason of the
incarnation. In the words of Augustin, it is &#8220;that by which we
understand the Son as less, in that he has taken upon Him the
creature.&#8221; The subordination in this case is that of voluntary
condescension, for the purpose of redeeming sinful
man.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iv.ii-p5">3. Some things, then, are so put in
the Scriptures concerning the Father and the Son, as to intimate

other texts there are of the kind. And some, again, are so put that
they show the Son as less on account of the form of a servant, that
is, of His having taken upon Him the creature of a changeable and
human substance; as, for instance, that which says, &#8220;For my
Father is greater than I;&#8221;<note place="end" n="215" id="iv.i.iv.ii-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.ii-p8"> <scripRef passage="John xiv. 28" id="iv.i.iv.ii-p8.2" parsed="|John|14|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.14.28">John xiv. 28</scripRef></p></note> and, &#8220;The Father judgeth no man,
but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.&#8221; For a little after
he goes on to say, &#8220;And hath given Him authority to execute
judgment also, because He is the Son of man.&#8221; And further, some
are so put, as to show Him at that time neither as less nor as
equal, but only to intimate that He is of the Father; as, for
instance, that which says, &#8220;For as the Father hath life in
Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself;&#8221;
and that other: &#8220;The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He
seeth the Father do.&#8221;<note place="end" n="216" id="iv.i.iv.ii-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.ii-p9"> <scripRef passage="John v. 22, 27, 26, 19" id="iv.i.iv.ii-p9.2" parsed="|John|5|22|0|0;|John|5|27|0|0;|John|5|26|0|0;|John|5|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.22 Bible:John.5.27 Bible:John.5.26 Bible:John.5.19">John v. 22, 27, 26,

therefore so said, because the Son is less in the form taken from
the creature, it will follow that the Father must have walked on
the water, or opened the eyes with clay and spittle of some other
one born blind, and have done the other things which the Son
appearing in the flesh did among men, before the Son did them;<note place="end" n="217" id="iv.i.iv.ii-p9.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.ii-p10"> <scripRef passage="Matt. xiv. 26" id="iv.i.iv.ii-p10.2" parsed="|Matt|14|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.14.26">Matt. xiv. 26</scripRef>, and

that He might be able to do those things, who said that the Son was
not able to do anything of Himself, except what He hath seen the
Father do. Yet who, even though he were mad, would think this? It
remains, therefore, that these texts are so expressed, because the
life of the Son is unchangeable as that of the Father is, and yet
He is of the Father; and the working of the Father and of the Son
is indivisible, and yet so to work is given to the Son from Him of
whom He Himself is, that is, from the Father; and the Son so sees
the Father, as that He is the Son in the very seeing Him. For to be
of the Father, that is, to be born of the Father, is to Him nothing
else than to see the Father; and to see Him working, is nothing
else than to work with Him: but therefore not from Himself, because
He is not from Himself. And, therefore, those things which &#8220;He
sees the Father do, these also doeth the Son likewise,&#8221; because
He is of the Father. For He neither does other things in like
manner, as a painter paints other pictures, in the same way as he
sees others to have been painted by another man; nor the same
things in a different manner, as the body expresses the same
letters, which the mind has thought; but &#8220;whatsoever things,&#8221;
saith He, &#8220;the Father doeth, these same things also doeth the Son
likewise.&#8221;<note place="end" n="218" id="iv.i.iv.ii-p10.4"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.ii-p11"> <scripRef passage="John v. 19" id="iv.i.iv.ii-p11.2" parsed="|John|5|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.19">John v. 19</scripRef></p></note> He has said
both &#8220;these same things,&#8221; and &#8220;likewise;&#8221; and hence the
working of both the Father and the Son is indivisible and equal,
but it is from the Father to the Son. Therefore the Son cannot do
anything of Himself, except what He seeth the Father do. From this
rule, then, whereby the Scriptures so speak as to mean, not to set
forth one as less than another, but only to show which is of which,
some have drawn this meaning, as if the Son were said to be less.
And some among ourselves who are more unlearned and least
instructed in these things, <pb n="39" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_39.html" id="iv.i.iv.ii-Page_39"/>endeavoring to take these texts
according to the form of a servant, and so misinterpreting them,
are troubled. And to prevent this, the rule in question is to be
observed whereby the Son is not less, but it is simply intimated
that He is of the Father, in which words not His inequality but His
birth is declared.</p>

to that whereby it is intimated that although equal, yet He is of
the Father. And in my opinion, if this is in such way doubtful,
that which it really is can neither be explained nor discerned,
then such passages may without danger be understood according to
either rule, as that, for instance, &#8220;My doctrine is not mine, but
His that sent me.&#8221;<note place="end" n="219" id="iv.i.iv.iii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.iii-p3"> <scripRef passage="John vii. 16" id="iv.i.iv.iii-p3.2" parsed="|John|7|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.7.16">John vii. 16</scripRef></p></note> For this may both be taken

which He is in such way equal to the Father, that He is yet of the
Father. For according to the form of God, as the Son is not one and
His life another, but the life itself is the Son; so the Son is not
one and His doctrine another, but the doctrine itself is the Son.
And hence, as the text, &#8220;He hath given life to the Son,&#8221; is no
otherwise to be understood than, He hath begotten the Son, who is
life; so also when it is said, He hath given doctrine to the Son,
it may be rightly understood to mean, He hath begotten the Son, who
is doctrine so that, when it is said, &#8220;My doctrine is not mine,
but His who sent me,&#8221; it is so to be understood as if it were, I
am not from myself, but from Him who sent me.</p>

the Son and the Holy Spirit are sent thither where they were, we
must inquire, how that sending, whether of the Son or of the Holy
Spirit, is to be understood; for of the Father alone, we nowhere
read that He is sent. Now, of the Son, the apostle writes thus:
&#8220;But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His
Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were
under the law.&#8221;<note place="end" n="231" id="iv.i.iv.vi-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.vi-p10"> <scripRef passage="Gal. iv. 4, 5" id="iv.i.iv.vi-p10.2" parsed="|Gal|4|4|4|5" osisRef="Bible:Gal.4.4-Gal.4.5">Gal. iv. 4, 5</scripRef></p></note> &#8220;He

Catholic does not know that he did not wish to signify the
privation of virginity; but, according to a Hebraism, the
difference of sex? When, therefore, he says, &#8220;God sent His Son,
made of a woman,&#8221; he sufficiently shows that the Son was
&#8220;sent&#8221; in this very way, in that He was &#8220;made of a woman.&#8221;
Therefore, in that He was born of God, He was in the world; but in
that He was born of Mary, He was sent and came into the world.

Spirit, not only because the Father, when He sent Him, that is,
when He made Him of a woman, is certainly understood not to have so
made Him without His own Spirit; but also because it is most
plainly and expressly said in the Gospel in answer to the Virgin
Mary, when she asked of the angel, <pb n="41" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_41.html" id="iv.i.iv.vi-Page_41"/>&#8220;How shall this be?&#8221; &#8220;The

reply, I suppose, if he has a right sense in these things, Because
the will of the Father and the Son is one, and their working
indivisible. In like manner, then, let him understand the
incarnation and nativity of the Virgin, wherein the Son is
understood as sent, to have been wrought by one and the same
operation of the Father and of the Son indivisibly; the Holy Spirit
certainly not being thence excluded, of whom it is expressly said,
&#8220;She was found with child by the Holy Ghost.&#8221; For perhaps our
meaning will be more plainly unfolded, if we ask in what manner God
sent His Son. He commanded that He should come, and He, complying
with the commandment, came. Did He then request, or did He only
suggest? But whichever of these it was, certainly it was done by a
word, and the Word of God is the Son of God Himself. Wherefore,
since the Father sent Him by a word, His being sent was the work of
both the Father and His Word; therefore the same Son was sent by
the Father and the Son, because the Son Himself is the Word of the
Father. For who would embrace so impious an opinion as to think the
Father to have uttered a word in time, in order that the eternal
Son might thereby be sent and might appear in the flesh in the
fullness of time? But assuredly it was in that Word of God itself
which was in the beginning with God and was God, namely, in the
wisdom itself of God, apart from time, at what time that wisdom
must needs appear in the flesh. Therefore, since without any
commencement of time, the Word was in the beginning, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God, it was in the Word itself
without any time, at what time the Word was to be made flesh and
dwell among us.<note place="end" n="240" id="iv.i.iv.vi-p19.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.vi-p20"> <scripRef passage="John i. 1, 2, 14" id="iv.i.iv.vi-p20.2" parsed="|John|1|1|1|2;|John|1|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.1-John.1.2 Bible:John.1.14">John i. 1, 2, 14</scripRef></p></note> And when

made in time, that the Incarnate Word might appear to men; while it
was in that Word Himself, apart from time, at what time this was to
be done; for the order of times is in the eternal wisdom of God
without time. Since, then, that the Son should appear in the flesh
was wrought by both the Father and the Son, it is fitly said that
He who appeared in that flesh was sent, and that He who did not
appear in it, sent Him; because those things which are transacted
outwardly before the bodily eyes have their existence from the
inward structure (<i>apparatu</i>) of the spiritual nature, and on
that account are fitly said to be sent. Further, that form of man
which He took is the person of the Son, not also of the Father; on
which account the invisible Father, together with the Son, who with
the Father is invisible, is said to have sent the same Son by
making Him visible. But if He became visible in such way as to
cease to be invisible with the Father, that is, if the substance of
the invisible Word were turned by a change and transition into a
visible creature, then the Son would be so understood to be sent by
the Father, that He would be found to be only sent; not also, with
the Father, sending. But since He so took the form of a servant, as
that the unchangeable form of God remained, it is clear that that
which became apparent in the Son was done by the Father and the Son
not being apparent; that is, that by the invisible Father, with the
invisible Son, the same Son Himself was sent so as to be visible.
Why, therefore, does He say, &#8220;Neither came I of myself?&#8221; This,
we may now say, is said according to the form of a servant, in the
same way as it is said, &#8220;I judge no man.&#8221;<note place="end" n="242" id="iv.i.iv.vi-p21.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.vi-p22"> <scripRef passage="John viii. 42, 15" id="iv.i.iv.vi-p22.2" parsed="|John|8|42|0|0;|John|8|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.8.42 Bible:John.8.15">John viii. 42, 15</scripRef></p></note></p>

prophetic vision was not shown to bodily eyes through bodily forms,
but in the spirit through spiritual images of bodily things. But
whosoever saw that dove and that fire, saw them with their eyes.
Although it may perhaps be disputed concerning the fire, whether it
was seen by the eyes or in the spirit, on account of the form of
the sentence. For the text does not say, They saw cloven tongues
like fire, but, &#8220;There appeared to them.&#8221; But we are not wont
to say with the same meaning, It appeared to me; as we say, I saw.
And in those spiritual visions of corporeal images the usual
expressions are, both, It appeared to me; and, I saw: but in those
things which are shown to the eyes through express corporeal forms,
the common expression is not, It appeared to me; but, I saw. There
may, therefore, be a question raised respecting that fire, how it
was seen; whether within in the spirit as it were outwardly, or
really outwardly before the eyes of the flesh. But of that dove,
which is said to have descended in a bodily form, no one ever
doubted that it was seen by the eyes. Nor, again, as we call the

said to be sent, on account of these corporeal forms which came

less than the Father, as the Son, because He was in the form of a

the unity of the person of the Son, but those corporeal forms
appeared for a time, in order to show what was necessary to be
shown, and then ceased to be. Why, then, is not the Father also
said to be sent, through those corporeal forms, the fire of the
bush, and the pillar of cloud or of fire, and the lightnings in the
mount, and whatever other things of the kind appeared at that time,
when (as we have learned from Scripture testimony) He spake face to
face with the fathers, if He Himself was manifested by those modes
and forms of the creature, as exhibited and presented corporeally
to human sight? But if the Son was manifested by them, why is He
said to be sent so long after, when He was made of a woman, as the
apostle says, &#8220;But when the fullness of time was come, God sent

before, when He appeared to the fathers by those changeable forms
of the creature? Or if He cannot rightly be said to be sent, unless
when the Word was made flesh, why is the Holy Spirit said to be
sent, of whom no such incarnation was ever wrought? But if by those
visible things, which are put before us in the Law and in the
prophets, neither the Father nor the Son but the Holy Spirit was
manifested, why also is He said to be sent now, when He was sent
also before after these modes?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iv.viii-p4">13. In the perplexity of this
inquiry, the Lord helping us, we must ask, first, whether the
Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit; or whether, sometimes the
Father, sometimes the Son, sometimes the Holy Spirit; or whether it
was without any distinction of persons, in such way as the one and
only God is spoken of, that is, that the Trinity itself appeared to
the Fathers by those forms of the creature. Next, whichever of
these alternatives shall have been found or thought true, whether
for this purpose only the creature was fashioned, wherein God, as
He judged it suitable at that time, should be shown to human sight;
or whether angels, who already existed, were so sent, as to speak
in the person of God, taking a corporeal form from the corporeal
creature, for the purpose of their ministry, as each had need; or
else, according to the power the Creator has given them, changing
and converting their own body itself, to which they are not
subject, but govern it as subject to themselves, into whatever
appearances they would that were suited and apt to their several
actions. Lastly, we shall discern that which it was our purpose to
ask, <i>viz</i>. whether the Son and the Holy Spirit were also sent
before; and, if they were so sent, what difference there is between
that sending, and the one which we read of in the Gospel; or
whether in truth neither of them were sent, except when either the
Son was made of the Virgin Mary, or the Holy Spirit appeared in a
visible form, whether in the dove or in tongues of
fire.</p>

texts understood only of the Father, and not of the Son or the Holy
Spirit, declare the Son to be visible, not by having taken flesh of
the Virgin, but aforetime also in Himself. For He Himself, they
say, appeared to the eyes of the Fathers. And if you say to them,
In whatever manner, then, the Son is visible in Himself, in that
manner also He is mortal in Himself; so that it plainly follows
that you would have this saying also understood only of the Father,
<i>viz</i>., &#8220;Who only hath immortality;&#8221; for if the Son is
mortal from having taken upon Him our flesh, then allow that it is
on account of this flesh that He is also visible: they reply, that
it is not on account of this flesh that they say that the Son is
mortal; but that, just as He was also before visible, so He was
also before mortal. For if they say the Son is mortal from having
taken our flesh, then it is not the Father alone without the Son
who hath immortality; because His Word also has immortality, by
which all things were made. For He did not therefore lose His
immortality, because He took mortal flesh; seeing that it could not
happen even to the human soul, that it should die with the body,
when the Lord Himself says, &#8220;Fear not them which kill the body,
but are not able to kill the soul.&#8221;<note place="end" n="266" id="iv.i.iv.x-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.x-p3"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 10.28" id="iv.i.iv.x-p3.1" parsed="|Matt|10|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.28">Matt. x. 28</scripRef></p></note> Or, forsooth, also the Holy Spirit
took flesh: concerning whom certainly they will, without doubt, be
troubled to say&#8212;if the Son is mortal on account of taking our
flesh&#8212;in what manner they understand that the Father only has
immortality without the Son and the Holy Spirit, since, indeed, the
Holy Spirit did not take our flesh; and if He has not immortality,
then the Son is not mortal on account of taking our flesh; but if
the Holy Spirit has immortality, then it is not said only of the
Father, &#8220;Who only hath immortality.&#8221; And therefore they think
they are able to prove that the Son in Himself was mortal also
before the incarnation, because changeableness itself is not
unfitly called mortality, according to which the soul also is said
to die; not because it is changed and turned into body, or into
some substance other than itself, but because, whatever in its own
selfsame substance is now after another mode than it once was, is
discovered to be mortal, in so far as it has ceased to be what it
was. Because then, say they, before the Son of God was born of the
Virgin Mary, He Himself appeared to our fathers, not in one and the
same form only, but in many forms; first in one form, then in
another; He is both visible in Himself, because His substance was
visible to mortal eyes, when He had not yet taken our flesh, and
mortal, inasmuch as He is changeable. And so also the Holy Spirit,
who appeared at one time as a dove, and another time as fire.
Whence, they say, the following texts do not belong to the Trinity,
but singularly and properly to the Father only: &#8220;Now unto the
King eternal, immortal, and invisible, the only wise God;&#8221; and,
&#8220;Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man
can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can
see.&#8221;</p>

reasoners, who are unable to know the substance even of the soul,
which is invisible, and therefore are very far indeed from knowing
that the substance of the one and only God, that is, the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit, remains ever not only invisible, but
also unchangeable, and that hence it possesses true and real
immortality; let us, who deny that God, whether the Father, or the
Son, or the Holy <pb n="45" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_45.html" id="iv.i.iv.x-Page_45"/>Spirit, ever appeared to bodily

the Lord God, walking in the garden in the cool of the evening, and
hid himself among the trees of the garden; and when God said,
&#8220;Adam, where art thou?&#8221;<note place="end" n="267" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 8-10" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|3|8|3|10" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.8-Gen.3.10">Gen. iii. 8&#8211;10</scripRef></p></note> replied, &#8220;I heard Thy voice, and
I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid myself from Thy
face.&#8221; For I do not see how such a walking and conversation of
God can be understood literally, except He appeared as a man. For
it can neither be said that a voice only of God was framed, when
God is said to have walked, or that He who was walking in a place
was not visible; while Adam, too, says that he hid himself from the
face of God. Who then was He? Whether the Father, or the Son, or
the Holy Spirit? Whether altogether indiscriminately did God the
Trinity Himself speak to man in the form of man? The context,
indeed, itself of the Scripture nowhere, it should seem, indicates
a change from person to person; but He seems still to speak to the
first man, who said, &#8220;Let there be light,&#8221; and, &#8220;Let there be
a firmament,&#8221; and so on through each of those days; whom we
usually take to be God the Father, making by a word whatever He
willed to make. For He made all things by His word, which Word we
know, by the right rule of faith, to be His only Son. If,
therefore, God the Father spake to the first man, and Himself was
walking in the garden in the cool of the evening, and if it was
from His face that the sinner hid himself amongst the trees of the
garden, why are we not to go on to understand that it was He also
who appeared to Abraham and to Moses, and to whom He would, and how
He would, through the changeable and visible creature, subjected to
Himself, while He Himself remains in Himself and in His own
substance, in which He is unchangeable and invisible? But,
possibly, it might be that the Scripture passed over in a hidden
way from person to person, and while it had related that the Father
said &#8220;Let there be light,&#8221; and the rest which it mentioned Him
to have done by the Word, went on to indicate the Son as speaking
to the first man; not unfolding this openly, but intimating it to
be understood by those who could understand it.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p4">18. Let him, then, who has the
strength whereby he can penetrate this secret with his mind&#8217;s
eye, so that to him it appears clearly, either that the Father also
is able, or that only the Son and Holy Spirit are able, to appear
to human eyes through a visible creature; let him, I say, proceed
to examine these things if he can, or even to express and handle
them in words; but the thing itself, so far as concerns this
testimony of Scripture, where God spake with man, is, in my
judgment, not discoverable, because it does not evidently appear
even whether Adam usually saw God with the eyes of his body;
especially as it is a great question what manner of eyes it was
that were opened when they tasted the forbidden fruit;<note place="end" n="268" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p5"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 7" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p5.2" parsed="|Gen|3|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.7">Gen. iii. 7</scripRef></p></note> for before
they had tasted, these eyes were closed. Yet I would not rashly
assert, even if that scripture implies Paradise to have been a
material place, that God could not have walked there in any way
except in some bodily form. For it might be said, that only words
were framed for the man to hear, without seeing any form. Neither,
because it is written, &#8220;Adam hid himself from the face of God,&#8221;
does it follow forthwith that he usually saw His face. For what if
he himself indeed could not see, but feared to be himself seen by
Him whose voice he had heard, and had felt His presence as he
walked? For Cain, too, said to God, &#8220;From Thy face I will hide
myself;&#8221;<note place="end" n="269" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p6"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iv. 14" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p6.2" parsed="|Gen|4|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.4.14">Gen. iv. 14</scripRef></p></note> yet we are
not therefore compelled to admit that he was wont to behold the

then uttered to the outward ears of men, especially in speaking to
the first man, it is both difficult to discover, and we have not
undertaken to say in this discourse. But if words alone and sounds
were wrought, by which to bring about some sensible presence of God
to those first men, I do not know why I should not there understand
the person of God the Father, seeing that His person is manifested
also in that voice, when Jesus appeared in glory on the mount

voice could be wrought without the work of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit (since the Trinity works indivisibly), but that such a voice
was wrought as to manifest the person of the Father only; just as
the Trinity wrought that human form from the Virgin Mary, yet it is
the person of the Son alone; for the invisible Trinity wrought the
visible person of the Son alone. Neither does anything forbid us,
not only to understand those words spoken to Adam as spoken by the
Trinity, but also to take them as manifesting the person of that
Trinity. For we are compelled to understand of the Father only,
that which is said, &#8220;This is my beloved Son.&#8221;<note place="end" n="273" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p9.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p10"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 3.17" id="iv.i.iv.xi-p10.1" parsed="|Matt|3|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.17">Matt. iii. 17</scripRef></p></note> For Jesus can neither be believed
nor understood to be the Son of the Holy Spirit, or even His own
Son. And where the voice uttered, &#8220;I have both glorified, and

Father; since it is the answer to that word of the Lord, in which
He had said, &#8220;Father, glorify thy Son,&#8221; which He could not say
except to God the Father only, and not also to the Holy Spirit,
whose Son He was not. But here, where it is written, &#8220;And the
Lord God said to Adam,&#8221; no reason can be given why the Trinity
itself should not be understood.</p>

is written, &#8220;Now the Lord had said unto Abraham, Get thee out of
thy country, and from thy kindred, and thy father&#8217;s house,&#8221; it
is not clear whether a voice alone came to the ears of Abraham, or

added the account of the three men, whom Abraham invites to his

Sara, <i>viz</i>. the one whom the Scripture calls Lord, as in the

neither a slight nor a passing consideration. For if one man had
appeared, what else would those at once cry out, who say that the
Son was visible also in His own substance before He was born of the
Virgin, but that it was Himself? since it is said, they say, of the
Father, &#8220;To the only invisible God.&#8221;<note place="end" n="281" id="iv.i.iv.xii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xii-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. i. 17" id="iv.i.iv.xii-p3.2" parsed="|1Tim|1|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.1.17">1 Tim. i. 17</scripRef></p></note> And yet, I could still go on to
demand, in what manner &#8220;He was found in fashion as a man,&#8221;
before He had taken our flesh, seeing that his feet were washed,
and that He fed upon earthly food? How could that be, when He was
still &#8220;in the form of God, and thought it not robbery to be equal
with God?&#8221;<note place="end" n="282" id="iv.i.iv.xii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Phil. ii. 6, 7" id="iv.i.iv.xii-p4.2" parsed="|Phil|2|6|2|7" osisRef="Bible:Phil.2.6-Phil.2.7">Phil. ii. 6, 7</scripRef></p></note> For, pray,
had He already &#8220;emptied Himself, taking upon Him the form of a
servant, and made in the likeness of men, and found in fashion as a
man?&#8221; when we know when it was that He did this through His birth
of the Virgin. How, then, before He had done this, did He appear as
one man to Abraham? or, was not that form a reality? I could put
these questions, if it had been one man that appeared to Abraham,
and if that one were believed to be the Son of God. But since three
men appeared, and no one of them is said to be greater than the
rest either in form, or age, or power, why should we not here
understand, as visibly intimated by the visible creature, the
equality of the Trinity, and one and the same substance in three
persons?<note place="end" n="283" id="iv.i.iv.xii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xii-p5"> [The theophanies of the Pentateuch
are trinitarian in their implication. They involve distinctions in
God&#8212;God sending, and God sent; God speaking of God, and God
speaking to God. The trinitarianism of the Old Testament has been
lost sight of to some extent in the modern construction of the
doctrine. The patristic, medi&#230;val, and reformation theologies
worked this vein with thoroughness, and the analysis of Augustin in
this reference is worthy of careful study.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iv.xii-p6">21. For, lest any one should think
that one among the three is in this way intimated to have been the
greater, and that this one is to be understood to have been the
Lord, the Son of God, while the other two were His angels; because,
whereas three appeared, Abraham there speaks to one as the Lord:
Holy Scripture has not forgotten to anticipate, by a contradiction,
such future cogitations and opinions, when a little while after it
says that two angels came to Lot, among whom that just man also,
who deserved to be freed from the burning of Sodom, speaks to one
as to the Lord. For so Scripture goes on to say, &#8220;And the Lord

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p2">&#8220;But there came two angels to
Sodom at even.&#8221; Here, what I have begun to set forth must be
considered more attentively. Certainly Abraham was speaking with
three, and called that one, in the singular number, the Lord.
Perhaps, some one may say, he recognized one of the three to be the
Lord, but the other two His angels. What, then, does that mean
which Scripture goes on to say, &#8220;And the Lord went His way, as
soon as He had left communing with Abraham; and Abraham returned to
his place: and there came two angels to Sodom at even?&#8221; Are we to
suppose that the one who, among the three, was recognized as the
Lord, had departed, and had sent the two angels that were with Him
to destroy Sodom? Let us see, then, what follows. &#8220;There came,&#8221;
it is said, &#8220;two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate
of Sodom: and Lot seeing them, rose up to meet them; and he bowed
himself with his face toward the ground; and he said, Behold now,
my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant&#8217;s house.&#8221; Here
it is clear, both that there were two angels, and that in the
plural number they were invited to partake of hospitality, and that
they were honorably designated lords, when they perchance were
thought to be men.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.iv.xiii-p3">22. Yet, again, it is objected that
except they were known to be angels of God, Lot would not have
bowed himself with his face to the ground. Why, then, is both
hospitality and food offered to them, as though they wanted such
human succor? But whatever may here lie hid, let us now pursue that
which we have undertaken. Two appear; both are called angels; they
are invited plurally; he speaks as with two plurally, until the
departure from Sodom. And then Scripture goes on to say, &#8220;And it
came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that they
said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou

meant by his saying to them, &#8220;Oh! not so, my lord,&#8221; if He who
was the Lord had already departed, and had sent the angels? Why is
it said, &#8220;Oh! not so, my lord,&#8221; and not, &#8220;Oh! not so, my
lords?&#8221; Or if he wished to speak to one of them, why does
Scripture say, &#8220;But Lot said to them, Oh! not so, my lord: behold
now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight,&#8221; etc.? Are we
here, too, to understand two persons in the plural number, but when
the two are addressed as one, then the one Lord God of one
substance? But which two persons do we here understand?&#8212;of the
Father and of the Son, or of the Father and of the Holy Spirit, or
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit? The last, perhaps, is the more
suitable; for they said of themselves that they were sent, which is
that which we say of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. For we find

appeared to him thus: &#8220;Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his
father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the
back side of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to
Horeb. And the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of
fire, out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and, behold, the
bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses
said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush
is not burnt. And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see,
God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, I am
the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob.&#8221;<note place="end" n="288" id="iv.i.iv.xiv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xiv-p3"> <scripRef passage="Ex. iii. 1-6" id="iv.i.iv.xiv-p3.2" parsed="|Exod|3|1|3|6" osisRef="Bible:Exod.3.1-Exod.3.6">Ex. iii. 1&#8211;6</scripRef></p></note> He is here also first called the

therefore, &#8220;who is over all, God blessed for ever,&#8221; is not

called the Angel of the Lord, when He appeared in a flame of fire
out of the bush? Was it because it was one of many angels, who by
an economy [or arrangement] bare the person of his Lord? or was
something of the creature assumed by Him in order to bring about a
visible appearance for the business in hand, and that words might
thence be audibly uttered, whereby the presence of the Lord might
be shown, in such way as was fitting, to the corporeal senses of
man, by means of the creature made subject? For if he was one of
the angels, who could easily affirm whether it was the person of
the Son which was imposed upon him to announce, or that of the Holy
Spirit, or that of God the Father, or altogether of the Trinity
itself, who is the one and only God, in order that he might say,
&#8220;I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob?&#8221; For we cannot say that the Son of God is the God of
Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and that the
Father is not; nor will any one dare to deny that either the Holy
Spirit, or the Trinity itself, whom we believe and understand to be
the one God, is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob. For he who is not God, is not the God of those
fathers. Furthermore, if not only the Father is God, as all, even
heretics, admit; but also the Son, which, whether they will or not,
they are compelled to acknowledge, since the apostle says, &#8220;Who
is over all, God blessed for ever;&#8221; and the Holy Spirit, since
the same apostle says, &#8220;Therefore glorify God in your body;&#8221;
when he had said above, &#8220;Know ye not that your body is the temple
of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God?&#8221;<note place="end" n="290" id="iv.i.iv.xiv-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xiv-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 20, 19" id="iv.i.iv.xiv-p5.2" parsed="|1Cor|6|20|0|0;|1Cor|6|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.20 Bible:1Cor.6.19">1 Cor. vi. 20, 19</scripRef></p></note> and these

assumed for the purpose of the business in hand, whereby both to
appear to human eyes, and to sound in human ears, and to be called
the Angel of the Lord, and the Lord, and God; then cannot God here
be understood to be the Father, but either the Son or the Holy
Spirit. Although I cannot call to mind that the Holy Spirit is
anywhere else called an angel, which yet may be understood from His

save that no one can be so insane as to believe the smoke, and the

the kind, to be the substance of the word and wisdom of God which

dared to say that they were the substance of God the Father. All
these things, then, were wrought through the creature serving the
Creator, and were presented in a suitable economy
(<i>dispensatio</i>) to human senses; unless, perhaps, because it
is said, &#8220;And Moses drew near to the cloud where God was,&#8221;
carnal thoughts must needs suppose that the cloud was indeed seen
by the people, but that within the cloud Moses with the eyes of the
flesh saw the Son of God, whom doting heretics will have to be seen
in His own substance. Forsooth, Moses may have seen Him with the
eyes of the flesh, if not only the wisdom of God which is Christ,
but even that of any man you please and howsoever wise, can be seen
with the eyes of the flesh; or if, because it is written of the
elders of Israel, that &#8220;they saw the place where the God of
Israel had stood,&#8221; and that &#8220;there was under His feet as it

present undertaking, neither on Mount Sinai do I see how it
appears, by all those things which were fearfully displayed to the

without rash assertion, to venture upon a modest and hesitating
conjecture from this passage, if it is possible to understand it of
one person of the Trinity, why do we not rather understand the Holy
Spirit to be spoken of, since the Law itself also, which was given

the slaying of the lamb and the celebration of the Passover until

had promised. And in that very coming of His, which we read of in
the Acts of the Apostles, there appeared cloven tongues like as of
fire, and it sat upon each of them:<note place="end" n="307" id="iv.i.iv.xvi-p13.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xvi-p14"> <scripRef passage="Acts. ii. 1-4" id="iv.i.iv.xvi-p14.2" parsed="|Acts|2|1|2|4" osisRef="Bible:Acts.2.1-Acts.2.4">Acts. ii. 1&#8211;4</scripRef></p></note> which agrees with Exodus, where it
is written, &#8220;And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because
the Lord descended upon it in fire;&#8221; and a little after, &#8220;And

things were therefore wrought because neither the Father nor the

doubtless that God appeared there, not by His own substance, which
remains invisible and unchangeable, but by the appearance above
mentioned of the creature; but that some special person of the
Trinity appeared, distinguished by a proper mark, as far as my
capacity of understanding reaches, we do not see.</p>

which troubles most people, <i>viz</i>. that it is written, &#8220;And
the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his

therefore, I pray Thee, if I have found grace in Thy sight, show me
now Thyself plainly, that I may see Thee, that I may find grace in
Thy sight, and that I may consider that this nation is Thy
people;&#8221; and a little after Moses again said to the Lord, &#8220;Show
me Thy glory.&#8221; What means this then, that in everything which was
done, as above said, God was thought to have appeared by His own
substance; whence the Son of God has been believed by these
miserable people to be visible not by the creature, but by Himself;
and that Moses, entering into the cloud, appeared to have had this
very object in entering, that a cloudy darkness indeed might be
shown to the eyes of the people, but that Moses within might hear
the words of God, as though he beheld His face; and, as it is said,
&#8220;And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh
unto his friend;&#8221; and yet, behold, the same Moses says, &#8220;If I
have found grace in Thy sight, show me Thyself plainly?&#8221;
Assuredly he knew that he saw corporeally, and he sought the true
sight of God spiritually. And that mode of speech accordingly which
was wrought in words, was so modified, as if it were of a friend
speaking to a friend. Yet who sees God the Father with the eyes of
the body? And that Word, which was in the beginning, the Word which
was with God, the Word which was God, by which all things were

sees with the eyes of the body? Yet what is, &#8220;Show me now Thyself

if Moses had not said this, we must indeed have borne with those
foolish people as we could, who think that the substance of God was
made visible to his eyes through those things which, as above
mentioned, were said or done. But when it is here demonstrated most
evidently that this was <i>not granted</i> to him, even though he
desired it; who will dare to say, that by the like forms which had
appeared visibly to him also, not the creature serving God, but

Holy Spirit are visible also to men who are awake, but that the
Father is not visible except to those who dream? How, then, do they
understand that of the Father alone, &#8220;Whom no man hath seen, nor
can see.&#8221;? When men sleep, are they then not men? Or cannot He,
who can fashion the likeness of a body to signify Himself through
the visions of dreamers, also fashion that same bodily creature to
signify Himself to the eyes of those who are awake? Whereas His own
very substance, whereby He Himself is that which He is, cannot be
shown by any bodily likeness to one who sleeps, or by any bodily
appearance to one who is awake; but this not of the Father only,
but also of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. And certainly, as to
those who are moved by the visions of waking men to believe that
not the Father, but only the Son, or the Holy Spirit, appeared to
the corporeal sight of men,&#8212;to omit the great extent of the
sacred pages, and their manifold interpretation, such that no one
of sound reason ought to affirm that the person of the Father was
nowhere shown to the eyes of waking men by any corporeal
appearance;&#8212;but, as I said, to omit this, what do they say of our
father Abraham, who was certainly awake and ministering, when,
after Scripture had premised, &#8220;The Lord appeared unto Abraham,&#8221;
not one, or two, but three men appeared to him; no one of whom is
said to have stood prominently above the others, no one more than
the others to have shone with greater glory, or to have acted more
authoritatively?<note place="end" n="348" id="iv.i.iv.xix-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.iv.xix-p9"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xviii. 1" id="iv.i.iv.xix-p9.2" parsed="|Gen|18|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.18.1">Gen. xviii. 1</scripRef></p></note></p>

<pb n="54" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_54.html" id="iv.i.iv.xix-Page_54"/>whether the Father, or
the Son, or the Holy Spirit; or whether sometimes the Father,
sometimes the Son, sometimes the Holy Spirit; or whether, without
any distinction of persons, as it is said, the one and only God,
that is, the Trinity itself, appeared to the fathers through those
forms of the creature: now that we have examined, so far as
appeared to be sufficient what places of the Holy Scriptures we
could, a modest and cautious consideration of divine mysteries
leads, as far as I can judge, to no other conclusion, unless that
we may not rashly affirm which person of the Trinity appeared to
this or that of the fathers or the prophets in some body or
likeness of body, unless when the context attaches to the narrative
some probable intimations on the subject. For the nature itself, or
substance, or essence, or by whatever other name that very thing,
which is God, whatever it be, is to be called, cannot be seen
corporeally: but we must believe that by means of the creature made
subject to Him, not only the Son, or the Holy Spirit, but also the
Father, may have given intimations of Himself to mortal senses by a
corporeal form or likeness. And since the case stands thus, that
this second book may not extend to an immoderate length, let us
consider what remains in those which follow.</p>

existing, were so sent as to speak in the person of God; and this,

are not so familiar with the Greek tongue as to be found in any way
competent to read and understand therein the books that treat of
such topics, in which class of writings, to judge by the little
which has been translated for us, I do not doubt that everything is
contained that we can profitably seek;<note place="end" n="351" id="iv.i.v.i-p3.4"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.i-p4"> [This is an important passage with
reference to Augustin&#8217;s learning. From it, it would appear that
he had not read the Greek Trinitarians in the original, and that
only &#8220;a little&#8221; of these had been translated, at the time when
he was composing this treatise. As this was from <span class="c19" id="iv.i.v.i-p4.1">
A.D.</span> 400 to <span class="c19" id="iv.i.v.i-p4.2">A.D.</span> 416&#8212;, the
treatises of Athanasius (d. 373), Basil (d. 379), Gregory of Nyssa
(d. 400?), and Gregory of Nazianzum (d. 390?) had been composed and
were current in the Eastern church. That Augustin thought out this
profound scheme of the doctrine of the Trinity by the close study
of Scripture alone, and unassisted by the equally profound
trinitarianism of the Greek church, is an evidence of the depth and
strength of his remarkable intellect.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> while yet I cannot resist my
brethren when they exact of me, by that law by which I am made
their servant, that I should minister above all to their
praiseworthy studies in Christ by my tongue and by my pen, of which
two yoked together in me, Love is the charioteer; and while I
myself confess that I have by writing learned many things which I
did not know: if this be so, then this my labor ought not to seem
superfluous to any idle, or to any very learned reader; while it is
needful in no small part, to many who are busy, and to many who are
unlearned, and among these last to myself. Supported, then, very
greatly, and aided by the writings we have already read of others
on this subject, I have undertaken to inquire into and to discuss,
whatever it seems to my judgment can be reverently inquired into
and discussed, concerning the Trinity, the one supreme and
supremely good God; He himself exhorting me to the inquiry, and
helping me in the discussion of it; in order that, if there are no
other writings of the kind, there may be something for those to
have and read who <pb n="56" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_56.html" id="iv.i.v.i-Page_56"/>are willing and capable; but if
any exist already, then it may be so much the easier to find some
such writings, the more there are of the kind in
existence.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.i-p5">2. Assuredly, as in all my writings
I desire not only a pious reader, but also a free corrector, so I
especially desire this in the present inquiry, which is so
important that I would there were as many inquirers as there are
objectors. But as I do not wish my reader to be bound down to me,
so I do not wish my corrector to be bound down to himself. Let not
the former love me more than the catholic faith, let not the latter
love himself more than the catholic verity. As I say to the former,
Do not be willing to yield to my writings as to the canonical
Scriptures; but in these, when thou hast discovered even what thou
didst not previously believe, believe it unhesitatingly; while in
those, unless thou hast understood with certainty what thou didst
not before hold as certain, be unwilling to hold it fast: so I say
to the latter, Do not be willing to amend my writings by thine own
opinion or disputation, but from the divine text, or by
unanswerable reason. If thou apprehendest anything of truth in
them, its being there does not make it mine, but by understanding
and loving it, let it be both thine and mine; but if thou
convictest anything of falsehood, though it have once been mine, in
that I was guilty of the error, yet now by avoiding it let it be
neither thine nor mine.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.i-p6">3. Let this third book, then, take
its beginning at the point to which the second had reached. For
after we had arrived at this, that we desired to show that the Son
was not therefore less than the Father, because the Father sent and
the Son was sent; nor the Holy Spirit therefore less than both,
because we read in the Gospel that He was sent both by the one and
by the other; we undertook then to inquire, since the Son was sent
thither, where He already was, for He came into the world, and
&#8220;was in the world;&#8221;<note place="end" n="352" id="iv.i.v.i-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.i-p7"> <scripRef passage="John i. 10" id="iv.i.v.i-p7.2" parsed="|John|1|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.10">John i. 10</scripRef></p></note> since also the Holy Spirit was sent
thither, where He already was, for &#8220;the Spirit of the Lord
filleth the world, and that which containeth all things hath

&#8220;sent&#8221; because He was born in the flesh so as to be no longer
hidden, and, as it were, came forth from the bosom of the Father,
and appeared to the eyes of men in the form of a servant; and the
Holy Spirit also was therefore &#8220;sent,&#8221; because He too was seen
as a dove in a corporeal form,<note place="end" n="354" id="iv.i.v.i-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.i-p9"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 3.16" id="iv.i.v.i-p9.1" parsed="|Matt|3|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.16">Matt. iii. 16</scripRef></p></note> and in cloven tongues, like as of

be sent, when spoken of them, means to go forth to the sight of
mortals in some corporeal form from a spiritual hiding-place;
which, because the Father did not, He is said only to have sent,
not also to be sent. Our next inquiry was, Why the Father also is
not sometimes said to be sent, if He Himself was manifested through
those corporeal forms which appeared to the eyes of the ancients.
But if the Son was manifested at these times, why should He be said
to be &#8220;sent&#8221; so long after, when the fullness of time was come
that He should be born of a woman;<note place="end" n="356" id="iv.i.v.i-p10.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.i-p11"> <scripRef passage="Gal. iv. 4" id="iv.i.v.i-p11.2" parsed="|Gal|4|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.4.4">Gal. iv. 4</scripRef></p></note> since, indeed, He was sent before
also, <i>viz</i>., when He appeared corporeally in those forms? Or
if He were not rightly said to be &#8220;sent,&#8221; except when the Word
was made flesh;<note place="end" n="357" id="iv.i.v.i-p11.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.i-p12"> <scripRef passage="John i. 14" id="iv.i.v.i-p12.2" parsed="|John|1|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.14">John i. 14</scripRef></p></note> why should
the Holy Spirit be read of as &#8220;sent,&#8221; of whom such an
incarnation never took place? But if neither the Father, nor the
Son, but the Holy Spirit was manifested through these ancient
appearances; why should He too be said to be &#8220;sent&#8221; now, when
He was also sent before in these various manners? Next we
subdivided the subject, that it might be handled most carefully,
and we made the question threefold, of which one part was explained
in the second book, and two remain, which I shall next proceed to
discuss. For we have already inquired and determined, that not only
the Father, nor only the Son, nor only the Holy Spirit appeared in
those ancient corporeal forms and visions, but either indifferently
the Lord God, who is understood to be the Trinity itself, or some
one person of the Trinity, whichever the text of the narrative
might signify, through intimations supplied by the
context.</p>

<div4 type="Chapter" title="What is to Be Said Thereupon." n="1" shorttitle="Chapter 1" progress="9.95%" prev="iv.i.v.i" next="iv.i.v.iii" id="iv.i.v.ii"><p class="c39" id="iv.i.v.ii-p1">

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.v.ii-p1.1">Chapter 1.&#8212;What is to Be Said Thereupon.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.ii-p2">4. Let us, then, continue our
inquiry now in order. For under the second head in that division
the question occurred, whether the creature was formed for that
work only, wherein God, in such way as He then judged it to be
fitting, might be manifested to human sight; or whether angels, who
already existed, were so sent as to speak in the person of God,
assuming a corporeal appearance from the corporeal creature for the
purpose of their ministry; or else changing and turning their own
body itself, to which they are not subject, but govern it as
subject to themselves, into whatever forms they would, that were
appropriate and fit for their actions, according to the power given
to them by the Creator. And when this part of the question shall
have been investigated, so far as God permit, then,
last<pb n="57" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_57.html" id="iv.i.v.ii-Page_57"/>ly, we shall have to see to that question with which we
started, <i>viz</i>., whether the Son and the Holy Spirit were also
&#8220;sent&#8221; before; and if it be so, then what difference there is
between that sending and the one of which we read in the Gospel; or
whether neither of them were sent, except when either the Son was
made of the Virgin Mary, or when the Holy Spirit appeared in a
visible form, whether as a dove or in tongues of fire.<note place="end" n="358" id="iv.i.v.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.ii-p3"> See above, Book ii. chap. vii. n.
13.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.ii-p4">5. I confess, however, that it
reaches further than my purpose can carry me to inquire whether the
angels, secretly working by the spiritual quality of their body
abiding still in them, assume somewhat from the inferior and more
bodily elements, which, being fitted to themselves, they may change
and turn like a garment into any corporeal appearances they will,
and those appearances themselves also real, as real water was
changed by our Lord into real wine;<note place="end" n="359" id="iv.i.v.ii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.ii-p5"> <scripRef passage="John ii. 9" id="iv.i.v.ii-p5.2" parsed="|John|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.2.9">John ii. 9</scripRef></p></note> or whether they transform their own
bodies themselves into that which they would, suitably to the
particular act. But it does not signify to the present question
which of these it is. And although I be not able to understand
these things by actual experience, seeing that I am a man, as the
angels do who do these things, and know them better than I know
them, <i>viz</i>., how far my body is changeable by the operation
of my will; whether it be by my own experience of myself, or by
that which I have gathered from others; yet it is not necessary
here to say which of these alternatives I am to believe upon the
authority of the divine Scriptures, lest I be compelled to prove
it, and so my discourse become too long upon a subject which does
not concern the present question.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.ii-p6">6. Our present inquiry then is,
whether the angels were then the agents both in showing those
bodily appearances to the eyes of men and in sounding those words
in their ears when the sensible creature itself, serving the
Creator at His beck, was turned for the time into whatever was
needful; as it is written in the book of Wisdom, &#8220;For the
creature serveth Thee, who art the Maker, increaseth his strength
against the unrighteous for their punishment, and abateth his
strength for the benefit of such as put their trust in Thee.
Therefore, even then was it altered into all fashions, and was
obedient to Thy grace, that nourisheth all things according to the
desire of them that longed for Thee.&#8221;<note place="end" n="360" id="iv.i.v.ii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.ii-p7"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. xvi. 24, 25" id="iv.i.v.ii-p7.2" parsed="|Wis|16|24|16|25" osisRef="Bible:Wis.16.24-Wis.16.25">Wisd. xvi. 24, 25</scripRef></p></note> For the power of the will of God
reaches through the spiritual creature even to visible and sensible
effects of the corporeal creature. For where does not the wisdom of
the omnipotent God work that which He wills, which &#8220;reacheth from

things&#8221;?<note place="end" n="361" id="iv.i.v.ii-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.ii-p8"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. viii. 1" id="iv.i.v.ii-p8.2" parsed="|Wis|8|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.8.1">Wisd. viii. 1</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.iii-p2">7. But there is one kind of natural
order in the conversion and changeableness of bodies, which,
although itself also serves the bidding of God, yet by reason of
its unbroken continuity has ceased to cause wonder; as is the case,
for instance, with those things which are changed either in very
short, or at any rate not long, intervals of time, in heaven, or
earth, or sea; whether it be in rising, or in setting, or in change
of appearance from time to time; while there are other things,
which, although arising from that same order, yet are less familiar
on account of longer intervals of time. And these things, although
the many stupidly wonder at them, yet are understood by those who
inquire into this present world, and in the progress of generations
become so much the less wonderful, as they are the more often
repeated and known by more people. Such are the eclipses of the sun
and moon, and some kinds of stars, appearing seldom, and
earthquakes, and unnatural births of living creatures, and other
similar things; of which not one takes place without the will of
God; yet, that it is so, is to most people not apparent. And so the
vanity of philosophers has found license to assign these things
also to other causes, true causes perhaps, but proximate ones,
while they are not able to see at all the cause that is higher than
all others, that is, the will of God; or again to false causes, and
to such as are not even put forward out of any diligent
investigation of corporeal things and motions, but from their own
guess and error.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.iii-p3">8. I will bring forward an example,
if I can, that this may be plainer. There is, we know, in the human
body, a certain bulk of flesh and an outward form, and an
arrangement and distraction of limbs, and a temperament of health;
and a soul breathed into it governs this body, and that soul a
rational one; which, therefore, although changeable, yet can be

partakes of the immutable; and he designates the immutable as the
<i>in idipsum:</i> the self-existent. In that striking passage in

meditations of himself and his mother, as they looked out upon the

wise man, such that his rational soul is already partaker of the
unchangeable and eternal truth, so that he consults it about all

his body by toil in some office of mercy, and should contract an
illness; and upon consulting the physicians, were to be told by one
that the cause of the disease was overmuch dryness of the body, but
by another that it was overmuch moisture; one of the two no doubt
would allege the true cause and the other would err, but both would
pronounce concerning proximate causes only, that is, corporeal
ones. But if the cause of that dryness were to be inquired into,
and found to be the self-imposed toil, then we should have come to
a yet higher cause, which proceeds from the soul so as to affect
the body which the soul governs. Yet neither would this be the
first cause, for that doubtless was a higher cause still, and lay
in the unchangeable wisdom itself, by serving which in love, and by
obeying its ineffable commands, the soul of the wise man had
undertaken that self-imposed toil; and so nothing else but the will
of God would be found most truly to be the first cause of that
illness. But suppose now in that office of pious toil this wise man
had employed the help of others to co-operate in the good work, who
did not serve God with the same will as himself, but either desired
to attain the reward of their own carnal desires, or shunned merely
carnal unpleasantnesses;&#8212;suppose, too, he had employed beasts of
burden, if the completion of the work required such a provision,
which beasts of burden would be certainly irrational animals, and
would not therefore move their limbs under their burdens because
they at all thought of that good work, but from the natural
appetite of their own liking, and for the avoiding of
annoyance;&#8212;suppose, lastly, he had employed bodily things
themselves that lack all sense, but were necessary for that work,
as <i>e.g</i>. corn, and wine, and oils, clothes, or money, or a
book, or anything of the kind;&#8212;certainly, in all these bodily
things thus employed in this work, whether animate or inanimate,
whatever took place of movement, of wear and tear, of reparation,
of destruction, of renewal or of change in one way or another, as
places and times affected them; pray, could there be, I say, any
other cause of all these visible and changeable facts, except the
invisible and unchangeable will of God, using all these, both bad
and irrational souls, and lastly bodies, whether such as were
inspired and animated by those souls, or such as lacked all sense,
by means of that upright soul as the seat of His wisdom, since
primarily that good and holy soul itself employed them, which His
wisdom had subjected to itself in a pious and religious
obedience?</p>

to the unchangeable pleasure of its own purpose, whether
incorporeal things or things corporeal, whether rational or

due order by the more subtle and powerful ones, so all bodies are
governed by the living spirit; and the living spirit devoid of
reason, by the reasonable living spirit; and the reasonable living
spirit that makes default and sins, by the living and reasonable

weak judgment, namely, why such miracles are wrought also by magic
arts; for the wise men of Pharaoh likewise made serpents, and did
other like things. Yet it is still more a matter of wonder, how it
was that the power of those magicians, which was able to make
serpents, when it came to very small flies, failed altogether. For
the lice, by which third plague the proud people of Egypt were
smitten, are very short-lived little flies; yet there certainly the
magicians failed, saying, &#8220;This is the finger of God.&#8221;<note place="end" n="380" id="iv.i.v.viii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.viii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Ex. vii." id="iv.i.v.viii-p3.2" parsed="|Exod|7|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.7">Ex. vii.</scripRef> and viii</p></note> And hence it
is given us to understand that not even those angels and powers of
the air that transgressed, who have been thrust down into that
lowest darkness, as into a peculiar prison, from their habitation
in that lofty ethereal purity, through whom magic arts have
whatever power they have, can do anything except by power given
from above. Now that power is given either to deceive the
deceitful, as it was given against the Egyptians, and against the
magicians also themselves, in order that in the seducing of those
spirits they might seem admirable by whom they were wrought, but to
be condemned by the truth of God; or for the admonishing of the
faithful, lest they should desire to do anything of the kind as
though it were a great thing, for which reason they have been
handed down to us also by the authority of Scripture; or lastly,
for the exercising, proving, and manifesting of the patience of the
righteous. For it was not by any small power of visible miracles

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.ix-p2">13. Yet it is not on this account
to be thought that the matter of visible things is subservient to
the bidding of those wicked angels; but rather to that of God, by
whom this power is given, just so far as He, who is unchangeable,
determines in His lofty and spiritual abode to give it. For water
and fire and earth are subservient even to wicked men, who are
condemned to the mines, in order that they may do therewith what
they will, but only so far as is permitted. Nor, in truth, are
those evil angels to be called creators, because by their means the
magicians, withstanding the servant of God, made frogs and
serpents; for it was not they who created them. But, in truth, some
hidden seeds of all things that are born corporeally and visibly,
are concealed in the corporeal elements of this world. For those
seeds that are visible now to our eyes from fruits and living
things, are quite distinct from the hidden seeds of those former
seeds; from which, at the bidding of the Creator, the water
produced the first swimming creatures and fowl, and the earth the
first buds after their kind, and the first living creatures after
their kind.<note place="end" n="382" id="iv.i.v.ix-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.ix-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. i. 20-25" id="iv.i.v.ix-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|1|20|1|25" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.20-Gen.1.25">Gen. i. 20&#8211;25</scripRef></p></note> For neither
at that time were those seeds so drawn forth into products of their
several kinds, as that the power of production was exhausted in
those products; but oftentimes, suitable combinations of
circumstances are wanting, whereby they may be enabled to burst
forth and complete their species. For, consider, the very least
shoot is a seed; for, if fitly consigned to the earth, it produces
a tree. But of this shoot there is a yet more subtle seed in some
grain of the same species, and this is visible even to us. But of
this grain also there is further still a seed, which, although we
are unable to see it with our eyes, yet we can conjecture its
existence from our reason; because, except there were some such
power in those elements, there would not so frequently be produced
from the earth things which had not been sown there; nor
<pb n="61" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_61.html" id="iv.i.v.ix-Page_61"/>yet so
many animals, without any previous commixture of male and female;
whether on the land, or in the water, which yet grow, and by
commingling bring forth others, while themselves sprang up without
any union of parents. And certainly bees do not conceive the seeds
of their young by commixture, but gather them as they lie scattered
over the earth with their mouth.<note place="end" n="383" id="iv.i.v.ix-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.ix-p4"> [Augustin is not alone in his
belief that the bee is an exception to the dictum; <i>omne animal
ex ovo</i>. As late as 1744, Thorley, an English &#8220;scientist,&#8221;
said that &#8220;the manner in which bees propagate their species is
entirely hid from the eyes of all men; and the most strict,
diligent, and curious observers and inquisitors have not been able
to discover it. It is a secret, and will remain a mystery. Dr.
Butler says that they do not copulate as other living creatures
do.&#8221; (Thorley: Melisselogia. Section viii.) The observations of
Huber and others have disproved this opinion. Some infer that
ignorance of physics proves ignorance of philosophy and theology.
The difference between matter and mind is so great, that erroneous
opinions in one province are compatible with correct ones in the
other. It does not follow that because Augustin had wrong notions
about bees, and no knowledge at all of the steam engine and
telegraph, his knowledge of God and the soul was inferior to that
of a modern materialist.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> For the Creator of these invisible
seeds is the Creator of all things Himself; since whatever comes
forth to our sight by being born, receives the first beginnings of
its course from hidden seeds, and takes the successive increments
of its proper size and its distinctive forms from these as it were
original rules. As therefore we do not call parents the creators of
men, nor farmers the creators of corn,&#8212;although it is by the
outward application of their actions that the power<note place="end" n="384" id="iv.i.v.ix-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.ix-p5"> [The English translator renders
&#8220;<i>virtus</i>&#8221; in its secondary sense of &#8220;goodness.&#8221;
Augustin employs it here, in its primary sense of &#8220;energy,&#8221;
&#8220;force.&#8221;&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> of God
operates within for the creating these things;&#8212;so it is not right
to think not only the bad but even the good angels to be creators,
if, through the subtilty of their perception and body, they know
the seeds of things which to us are more hidden, and scatter them
secretly through fit temperings of the elements, and so furnish
opportunities of producing things, and of accelerating their
increase. But neither do the good angels do these things, except as
far as God commands, nor do the evil ones do them wrongfully,
except as far as He righteously permits. For the malignity of the
wicked one makes his own will wrongful; but the power to do so, he
receives rightfully, whether for his own punishment, or, in the
case of others, for the punishment of the wicked, or for the praise
of the good.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.ix-p6">14. Accordingly, the Apostle Paul,
distinguishing God&#8217;s creating and forming within, from the

creation of visible things it is God that works from within; but
the exterior operations, whether of good or bad, of angels or men,
or even of any kind of animal, according to His own absolute power,
and to the distribution of faculties, and the several appetites for
things pleasant, which He Himself has imparted, are applied by Him
to that nature of things wherein He creates all things, in like
manner as agriculture is to the soil. Wherefore I can no more call
the bad angels, evoked by magic arts, the creators of the frogs and

crop, which I see to have sprung up through their labor.</p>

soul, arises in truth from suitable reasons, which immutably exist
in that highest wisdom of God Himself, which no extent of place
contains; and which, while it is itself unchangeable, yet quits not
one even of those things which are changeable, because there is not
one of them that is not created by itself. For it was the
unchangeable and invisible reason of the wisdom of God, by which
all things are created, which caused not rods, but cattle, to be
born from cattle; but that the color of the cattle conceived should
be in any degree influenced by the variety of the rods, came to
pass through the soul of the pregnant cattle being affected through
their eyes from without, and so according to its own measure
drawing inwardly within itself the rule of formation, which it
received from the innermost power of its own Creator. How great,
however, may be the power of the soul in affecting and changing
corporeal substance (although certainly it cannot be called the
creator of the body, because every cause of changeable and sensible
substance, and all its <pb n="62" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_62.html" id="iv.i.v.ix-Page_62"/>measure and number and weight,
by which are brought to pass both its being at all and its being of
such and such a nature, arise from the intelligible and
unchangeable life, which is above all things, and which reaches
even to the most distant and earthly things), is a very copious
subject, and one not now necessary. But I thought the act of Jacob
about the cattle should be noticed, for this reason, <i>viz</i>. in
order that it might be perceived that, if the man who thus placed
those rods cannot be called the creator of the colors in the lambs
and kids; nor yet even the souls themselves of the mothers, which
colored the seeds conceived in the flesh by the image of variegated
color, conceived through the eyes of the body, so far as nature
permitted it; much less can it be said that the creators of the
frogs and serpents were the bad angels, through whom the magicians
of Pharaoh then made them.</p>

administer the creature from the innermost and highest
turning-point of causation, which He alone does who is God the
Creator; but quite another thing to apply some operation from
without in proportion to the strength and faculties assigned to
each by Him, so that what is created may come forth into being at
this time or at that, and in this or that way. For all these things
in the way of original and beginning have already been created in a
kind of texture of the elements, but they come forth when they get
the opportunity.<note place="end" n="388" id="iv.i.v.x-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.x-p3"> [This is the same as the
theological distinction between substances and their modifications.
&#8220;The former,&#8221; says Howe, &#8220;are the proper object of creation
strictly taken; the modifications of things are not properly
created, in the strictest sense of creation, but are educed and
brought forth out of those substantial things that were themselves
created, or made out of nothing.&#8221;&#8212;Germs are originated <i>ex
nihilo</i>, and fall under creation proper; their evolution and
development takes place according to the nature and inherent force
of the germ, and falls under providence, in distinction from
creation. See the writer&#8217;s Theological Essays,

mothers are pregnant with young, so the world itself is pregnant
with the causes of things that are born; which are not created in
it, except from that highest essence, where nothing either springs
up or dies, either begins to be or ceases. But the applying from
without of adventitious causes, which, although they are not
natural, yet are to be applied according to nature, in order that
those things which are contained and hidden in the secret bosom of
nature may break forth and be outwardly created in some way by the
unfolding of the proper measures and numbers and weights which they
have received in secret from Him &#8220;who has ordered all things in
measure and number and weight:&#8221;<note place="end" n="389" id="iv.i.v.x-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.x-p4"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. xi. 20" id="iv.i.v.x-p4.2" parsed="|Wis|11|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.11.20">Wisd. xi. 20</scripRef></p></note> this is not only in the power of
bad angels, but also of bad men, as I have shown above by the
example of agriculture.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.x-p5">17. But lest the somewhat different
condition of animals should trouble any one, in that they have the
breath of life with the sense of desiring those things that are
according to nature, and of avoiding those things that are contrary
to it; we must consider also, how many men there are who know from
what herbs or flesh, or from what juices or liquids you please, of
whatever sort, whether so placed or so buried, or so bruised or so
mixed, this or that animal is commonly born; yet who can be so
foolish as to dare to call himself the creator of these animals? Is
it, therefore, to be wondered at, if just as any, the most
worthless of men, can know whence such or such worms and flies are
produced; so the evil angels in proportion to the subtlety of their
perceptions discern in the more hidden seeds of the elements whence
frogs and serpents are produced, and so through certain and known
opportune combinations applying these seeds by secret movements,
cause them to be created, but do not create them? Only men do not
marvel at those things that are usually done by men. But if any one
chance to wonder at the quickness of those growths, in that those
living beings were so quickly made, let him consider how even this
may be brought about by men in proportion to the measure of human
capability. For whence is it that the same bodies generate worms
more quickly in summer than in winter, or in hotter than in colder
places? Only these things are applied by men with so much the more
difficulty, in proportion as their earthly and sluggish members are
wanting in subtlety of perception, and in rapidity of bodily
motion. And hence it arises that in the case of any kind of angels,
in proportion as it is easier for them to draw out the proximate
causes from the elements, so much the more marvellous is their
rapidity in works of this kind.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.x-p6">18. But He only is the creator who
is the chief former of these things. Neither can any one be this,
unless He with whom primarily rests the measure, number, and weight
of all things existing; and He is God the one Creator, by whose
unspeakable power it comes to pass, also, that what these angels
were able to do if they were permitted, they are therefore not able
to do because they are not permitted. For there is no other reason
why they who made frogs and serpents were not able to make the most
minute flies, unless because <pb n="63" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_63.html" id="iv.i.v.x-Page_63"/>the greater power of God was
present prohibiting them, through the Holy Spirit; which even the

God.&#8221;<note place="end" n="390" id="iv.i.v.x-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.x-p7"> <scripRef passage="Ex. vii. 12" id="iv.i.v.x-p7.2" parsed="|Exod|7|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.7.12">Ex. vii. 12</scripRef>, and viii. 7, 18,

they are able to do by nature, yet cannot do, because they are
prohibited; and what the very condition of their nature itself does
not suffer them to do; it is difficult, nay, impossible, for man to

mentions when he says, &#8220;To another the discerning of
spirits.&#8221;<note place="end" n="391" id="iv.i.v.x-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.x-p8"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xii. 10" id="iv.i.v.x-p8.2" parsed="|1Cor|12|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.10">1 Cor. xii. 10</scripRef></p></note> For we know
that a man can walk, yet that he cannot do so if he is not
permitted; but that he cannot fly, even if he be permitted. So
those angels, also, are able to do certain things if they are
permitted by more powerful angels, according to the supreme
commandment of God; but cannot do certain other things, not even if
they are permitted by them; because He does not permit from whom
they have received such and such a measure of natural powers: who,
even by His angels, does not usually permit what He has given them
power to be able to do.</p>

corporeal things which are done in the order of nature in a
perfectly usual series of times, as <i>e.g.</i>, the rising and
setting of the stars, the generations and deaths of animals, the
innumerable diversities of seeds and buds, the vapors and the
clouds, the snow and the rain, the lightnings and the thunder, the

and all like things; excepting also those which in the same order
of nature occur rarely, such as eclipses, unusual appearances of
stars, and monsters, and earthquakes, and such like;&#8212;all these, I
say, are to be excepted, of which indeed the first and chief cause
is only the will of God; whence also in the Psalm, when some things
of this kind had been mentioned, &#8220;Fire and hail, snow and vapor,
stormy wind,&#8221; lest any one should think those to be brought about
either by chance or only from corporeal causes, or even from such
as are spiritual, but exist apart from the will of God, it is added

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.xi-p2">Excepting, therefore, all these
things as I just now said, there are some also of another kind;
which, although from the same corporeal substance, are yet brought
within reach of our senses in order to announce something from God,
and these are properly called miracles and signs; yet is not the
person of God Himself assumed in all things which are announced to
us by the Lord God. When, however, that person is assumed, it is
sometimes made manifest as an angel; sometimes in that form which
is not an angel in his own proper being, although it is ordered and
ministered by an angel. Again, when it is assumed in that form
which is not an angel in his own proper being; sometimes in this
case it is a body itself already existing, assumed after some kind
of change, in order to make that message manifest; sometimes it is
one that comes into being for the purpose, and that being
accomplished, is discarded. Just as, also, when men are the
messengers, sometimes they speak the words of God in their own
person, as when it is premised, &#8220;The Lord said,&#8221; or, &#8220;Thus
saith the Lord,&#8221;<note place="end" n="393" id="iv.i.v.xi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xi-p3"> <scripRef passage="Jer. xxxi. 1, 2" id="iv.i.v.xi-p3.2" parsed="|Jer|31|1|31|2" osisRef="Bible:Jer.31.1-Jer.31.2">Jer. xxxi. 1, 2</scripRef></p></note> or any other such phrase, but
sometimes without any such prefix, they take upon themselves the
very person of God, as <i>e.g.</i>: &#8220;I will instruct thee, and
teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt go:&#8221;<note place="end" n="394" id="iv.i.v.xi-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xi-p4"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xxxii. 8" id="iv.i.v.xi-p4.2" parsed="|Ps|32|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.32.8">Ps. xxxii. 8</scripRef></p></note> so, not only in word, but also in
act, the signifying of the person of God is imposed upon the
prophet, in order that he may bear that person in the ministering
of the prophecy; just as he, for instance, bore that person who
divided his garment into twelve parts, and gave ten of them to the
servant of King Solomon, to the future king of Israel.<note place="end" n="395" id="iv.i.v.xi-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xi-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 Kings xi. 30, 31" id="iv.i.v.xi-p5.2" parsed="|1Kgs|11|30|11|31" osisRef="Bible:1Kgs.11.30-1Kgs.11.31">1 Kings xi. 30, 31</scripRef></p></note> Sometimes,
also, a thing which was not a prophet in his own proper self, and
which existed already among earthly things, was assumed in order to
signify this; as Jacob, when he had seen the dream, upon waking up
did with the stone, which when asleep he had under his head.<note place="end" n="396" id="iv.i.v.xi-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xi-p6"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xxviii. 18" id="iv.i.v.xi-p6.2" parsed="|Gen|28|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.28.18">Gen. xxviii. 18</scripRef></p></note> Sometimes a
thing is made in the same kind, for the mere purpose; so as either
to continue a little while in existence, as that brazen serpent was
able to do which was lifted up in the wilderness,<note place="end" n="397" id="iv.i.v.xi-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xi-p7"> <scripRef passage="Num. xxi. 9" id="iv.i.v.xi-p7.2" parsed="|Num|21|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Num.21.9">Num. xxi. 9</scripRef></p></note> and as written records are able to
do likewise; or so as to pass away after having accomplished its
ministry, as the bread made for the purpose is consumed in the
receiving of the sacrament.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.xi-p8">20. But because these things are
known to men, in that they are done by men, they may well meet with
reverence as being holy things, but they cannot cause wonder as
being miracles. And therefore those things which are done by angels
are the more wonderful to us, in that they are more difficult and
more known; but they are known and easy to them as being their own
actions. An angel speaks in the person of God to man, saying, &#8220;I
am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, <pb n="64" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_64.html" id="iv.i.v.xi-Page_64"/>and the God

wide difference between the deed of the angel and the deed of the
man. The former is both to be wondered at and to be understood, the
latter only to be understood. That which is understood from both,
is perhaps one and the same; but those things from which it is
understood, are different. Just as if the name of God were written
both in gold and in ink; the former would be the more precious, the
latter the more worthless; yet that which is signified in both is
one and the same. And although the serpent that came from Moses&#8217;
rod signified the same thing as Jacob&#8217;s stone, yet Jacob&#8217;s
stone signified something better than did the serpents of the
magicians. For as the anointing of the stone signified Christ in

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.xi-p21">21. What man, again, knows how the
angels made or took those clouds and fires in order to signify the

Holy Spirit was manifested in those corporeal forms? Just as
infants do not know of that which is placed upon the altar and
consumed after the performance of the holy celebration, whence or
in what manner it is made, or whence it is taken for religious use.
And if they were never to learn from their own experience or that
of others, and never to see that species of thing except during the
celebration of the sacrament, when it is being offered and given;
and if it were told them by the most weighty authority whose body

resembled this. But it is certainly a useful caution to myself,
that I should remember what my own powers are, and admonish my
brethren that they also remember what theirs are, lest human
infirmity pass on beyond what is safe. For how the angels do these
things, or rather, how God does these things by His angels, and how
far He wills them to be done even by the bad angels, whether by
permitting, or commanding, or compelling, from the hidden seat of
His own supreme power; this I can neither penetrate by the sight of
the eyes, nor make clear by assurance of reason, nor be carried on
to comprehend it by reach of intellect, so as to speak thereupon to
all questions that may be asked respecting these matters, as
certainly as if I were an angel, or a prophet, or an apostle.
&#8220;For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devices
are but uncertain. For the corruptible body presseth down the soul,
and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down the mind, that museth upon
many things. And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon
earth, and with labor do we find the things that are before us; but

us from above, and to His grace imparted to our minds, I dare to
say confidently, that neither God the Father, nor His Word, nor His

that which He is, and whereby He is that which He is; and much less
is in this regard visible. Since there are no doubt some things

that all those appearances to the fathers, when God was presented
to them according to His own dispensation, suitable to the times,
were wrought through the creature. And if we cannot discern in what
manner He wrought them by ministry of angels, yet we say that they
were wrought by angels; but not from our own power of discernment,
lest we should seem to any one to be wise beyond our measure,

authority is extant of the divine Scriptures, from which our reason
ought not to turn aside; nor by leaving the solid support of the
divine utterance, to fall headlong over the precipice of its own
surmisings, in matters wherein neither the perceptions of the body
rule, nor the clear reason of the truth shines forth. Now,
certainly, it is written most clearly in the Epistle to the
Hebrews, when the dispensation of the New Testament was to be
distinguished from the dispensation of the Old, according to the
fitness of ages and of times, that not only those visible things,
but also the word itself, was wrought by angels. For it is said
thus: &#8220;But to which of the angels said He at any time, Sit on my
right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool? Are they not
all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall
be heirs of salvation?&#8221;<note place="end" n="415" id="iv.i.v.xii-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p7"> <scripRef passage="Heb. i. 13, 14" id="iv.i.v.xii-p7.2" parsed="|Heb|1|13|1|14" osisRef="Bible:Heb.1.13-Heb.1.14">Heb. i. 13, 14</scripRef></p></note> Whence it appears that all those
things were not only wrought by angels, but wrought also on our
account, that is, on account of the people of God, to whom is
promised the inheritance of eternal life. As it is written also to
the Corinthians, &#8220;Now all these things happened unto them in a
figure: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends
of the world are come.&#8221;<note place="end" n="416" id="iv.i.v.xii-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p8"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 11" id="iv.i.v.xii-p8.2" parsed="|1Cor|10|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.11">1 Cor. x. 11</scripRef></p></note> And then, demonstrating by plain
consequence that as at that time the word was spoken by the angels,
so now by the Son; &#8220;Therefore,&#8221; he says, &#8220;we ought to give

any time we should let them slip. For if the word spoken by angels
was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a
just recompense of reward; how shall we escape, if we neglect so
great salvation?&#8221; And then, as though you asked, What
salvation?&#8212;in order to show that he is now speaking of the New
Testament, that is, of the word which was spoken not by angels, but
by the Lord, he says, &#8220;Which at the first began to be spoken by
the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard Him; God
also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with
divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to His own
will.&#8221;<note place="end" n="417" id="iv.i.v.xii-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p9"> <scripRef passage="Heb. ii. 1-4" id="iv.i.v.xii-p9.2" parsed="|Heb|2|1|2|4" osisRef="Bible:Heb.2.1-Heb.2.4">Heb. ii. 1&#8211;4</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.xii-p10">23. But some one may say, Why then
is it written, &#8220;The Lord said to Moses;&#8221; and not, rather, The
angel said to Moses? Because, when the crier proclaims the words of
the judge, it is not usually written in the record, so and so the
crier said, but so and so the judge. In like manner also, when the
holy prophet speaks, although we say, The prophet said, we mean
nothing else to be understood than that the Lord said; and if we
were to say, The Lord said, we should not put the prophet aside,
but only intimate who spake by him. And, indeed, these Scriptures
often reveal the angel to be the Lord, of whose speaking it is from
time to time said, &#8220;the Lord said,&#8221; as we have shown already.
But on account of those who, since the Scripture in that place
specifies an angel, will have the Son of God Himself and in
<pb n="66" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_66.html" id="iv.i.v.xii-Page_66"/>Himself
to be understood, because He is called an angel by the prophet, as
announcing the will of His Father and of Himself; I have therefore
thought fit to produce a plainer testimony from this epistle, where
it is not said by an angel, but &#8220;by angels.&#8221;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.xii-p11">24. For Stephen, too, in the Acts
of the Apostles, relates these things in that manner in which they
are also written in the Old Testament: &#8220;Men, brethren, and
fathers, hearken,&#8221; he says; &#8220;The God of glory appeared unto our
father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia.&#8221;<note place="end" n="418" id="iv.i.v.xii-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p12"> <scripRef passage="Acts vii. 2" id="iv.i.v.xii-p12.2" parsed="|Acts|7|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.7.2">Acts vii. 2</scripRef></p></note> But lest any one should think that
the God of glory appeared then to the eyes of any mortal in that
which He is in Himself, he goes on to say that an angel appeared to
Moses. &#8220;Then fled Moses,&#8221; he says, &#8220;at that saying, and was a
stranger in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons. And when
forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness
of mount Sinai an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.
When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to
behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying, I am the
God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold. Then
said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet,&#8221;<note place="end" n="419" id="iv.i.v.xii-p12.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p13"> <scripRef passage="Ex. ii. 15" id="iv.i.v.xii-p13.2" parsed="|Exod|2|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.2.15">Ex. ii. 15</scripRef> and iii.

certainly, he speaks both of angel and of Lord; and of the same as
the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; as
is written in Genesis.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.xii-p14">25. Can there be any one who will
say that the Lord appeared to Moses by an angel, but to Abraham by
Himself? Let us not answer this question from Stephen, but from the
book itself, whence Stephen took his narrative. For, pray, because
it is written, &#8220;And the Lord God said unto Abraham;&#8221;<note place="end" n="420" id="iv.i.v.xii-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p15"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xii. 1" id="iv.i.v.xii-p15.2" parsed="|Gen|12|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.12.1">Gen. xii. 1</scripRef></p></note> and a little
after, &#8220;And the Lord God appeared unto Abraham;&#8221;<note place="end" n="421" id="iv.i.v.xii-p15.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p16"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xvii. 1" id="iv.i.v.xii-p16.2" parsed="|Gen|17|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.17.1">Gen. xvii. 1</scripRef></p></note> were these
things, for this reason, not done by angels? Whereas it is said in
like manner in another place, &#8220;And the Lord appeared to him in
the plains of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the
day;&#8221; and yet it is added immediately, &#8220;And he lift up his eyes
and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him:&#8221;<note place="end" n="422" id="iv.i.v.xii-p16.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p17"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xviii. 1, 2" id="iv.i.v.xii-p17.2" parsed="|Gen|18|1|18|2" osisRef="Bible:Gen.18.1-Gen.18.2">Gen. xviii. 1, 2</scripRef></p></note> of whom we have already spoken. For
how will these people, who either will not rise from the words to
the meaning, or easily throw themselves down from the meaning to
the words,&#8212;how, I say, will they be able to explain that God was
seen in three men, except they confess that they were angels, as
that which follows also shows? Because it is not said an angel
spoke or appeared to him, will they therefore venture to say that
the vision and voice granted to Moses was wrought by an angel
because it is so written, but that God appeared and spake in His
own substance to Abraham because there is no mention made of an
angel? What of the fact, that even in respect to Abraham an angel
is not left unmentioned? For when his son was ordered to be offered
up as a sacrifice, we read thus: &#8220;And it came to pass after these
things that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and
he said, Behold, here I am. And He said, Take now thy son, thine
only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of
Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the
mountains that I will tell thee of.&#8221; Certainly God is here
mentioned, not an angel. But a little afterwards Scripture hath it
thus: &#8220;And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife
to slay his son. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of
heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. And he
said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything
unto him.&#8221; What can be answered to this? Will they say that God
commanded that Isaac should be slain, and that an angel forbade it?
and further, that the father himself, in opposition to the decree
of God, who had commanded that he should be slain, obeyed the
angel, who had bidden him spare him? Such an interpretation is to
be rejected as absurd. Yet not even for it, gross and abject as it
is, does Scripture leave any room, for it immediately adds: &#8220;For
now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy
son, thine only son, on account of me.&#8221;<note place="end" n="423" id="iv.i.v.xii-p17.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p18"> <i>Propter me</i></p></note> What is &#8220;on account of me,&#8221;
except on account of Him who had commanded him to be slain? Was
then the God of Abraham the same as the angel, or was it not rather
God by an angel? Consider what follows. Here, certainly, already an
angel has been most clearly spoken of; yet notice the context:
&#8220;And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind
him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and
took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead
of his son. And Abraham called the name of that place, The Lord
saw:<note place="end" n="424" id="iv.i.v.xii-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p19"> <i>Dominus vidit</i></p></note> as it is
said to this day, In the mount the Lord was seen.&#8221;<note place="end" n="425" id="iv.i.v.xii-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p20"> <i>Dominus visus
est</i></p></note> Just as
that <pb n="67" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_67.html" id="iv.i.v.xii-Page_67"/>which a little before God said by an angel, &#8220;For now I
know that thou fearest God;&#8221; not because it was to be understood
that God then came to know, but that He brought it to pass that
through God Abraham himself came to know what strength of heart he
had to obey God, even to the sacrificing of his only son: after
that mode of speech in which the effect is signified by the
efficient,&#8212;as cold is said to be sluggish, because it makes men
sluggish; so that He was therefore said to know, because He had
made Abraham himself to know, who might well have not discerned the
firmness of his own faith, had it not been proved by such a trial.
So here, too, Abraham called the name of the place &#8220;The Lord
saw,&#8221; that is, caused Himself to be seen. For he goes on
immediately to say, &#8220;As it is said to this day, In the mount the
Lord was seen.&#8221; Here you see the same angel is called Lord:
wherefore, unless because the Lord spake by the angel? But if we
pass on to that which follows, the angel altogether speaks as a
prophet, and reveals expressly that God is speaking by the angel.
&#8220;And the angel of the Lord,&#8221; he says, &#8220;called unto Abraham
out of heaven the second time, and said, By myself I have sworn,
saith the Lord; for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not
withheld thy son, thine only son, on account of me,&#8221;<note place="end" n="426" id="iv.i.v.xii-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p21"> <scripRef passage="Gen. 22" id="iv.i.v.xii-p21.1" parsed="|Gen|22|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.22">Gen. xxii</scripRef></p></note> etc.
Certainly these words, <i>viz</i>. that he by whom the Lord speaks
should say, &#8220;Thus saith the Lord,&#8221; are commonly used by the
prophets also. Does the Son of God say of the Father, &#8220;The Lord
saith,&#8221; while He Himself is that Angel of the Father? What then?
Do they not see how hard pressed they are about these three men who
appeared to Abraham, when it had been said before, &#8220;The Lord
appeared to him?&#8221; Were they not angels because they are called
men? Let them read Daniel, saying, &#8220;Behold the man Gabriel.&#8221;<note place="end" n="427" id="iv.i.v.xii-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p22"> <scripRef passage="Dan. ix. 21" id="iv.i.v.xii-p22.2" parsed="|Dan|9|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.9.21">Dan. ix. 21</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.v.xii-p23">26. But why do we delay any longer
to stop their mouths by another most clear and most weighty proof,
where not an angel in the singular nor men in the plural are spoken
of, but simply angels; by whom not any particular word was wrought,
but the Law itself is most distinctly declared to be given; which
certainly none of the faithful doubts that God gave to Moses for
the control of the children of Israel, or yet, that it was given by
angels. So Stephen speaks: &#8220;Ye stiff-necked,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and
uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy
Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye. Which of the prophets have
not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed
before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the
betrayers and murderers: who have received the Law by the
disposition of angels,<note place="end" n="428" id="iv.i.v.xii-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p24"> <i>In edictis

evident than this? What more strong than such an authority? The
Law, indeed, was given to that people by the disposition of angels;
but the advent of our Lord Jesus Christ was by it prepared and
pre-announced; and He Himself, as the Word of God, was in some
wonderful and unspeakable manner in the angels, by whose
disposition the Law itself was given. And hence He said in the
Gospel, &#8220;For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me;
for he wrote of me.&#8221;<note place="end" n="430" id="iv.i.v.xii-p25.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p26"> <scripRef passage="John v. 46" id="iv.i.v.xii-p26.2" parsed="|John|5|46|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.46">John v. 46</scripRef></p></note> Therefore then the Lord was
speaking by the angels; and the son of God, who was to be the
Mediator of God and men, from the seed of Abraham, was preparing
His own advent by the angels, that He might find some by whom He
would be received, confessing themselves guilty, whom the Law
unfulfilled had made transgressors. And hence the apostle also says
to the Galatians, &#8220;Wherefore then serveth the Law? It was added
because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the
promise was made, which [seed] was ordered<note place="end" n="431" id="iv.i.v.xii-p26.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p27"> <i>Dispositum</i></p></note> through angels in the hand of a

ordered through angels in His <i>own</i> hand. For He was not born
in limitation, but in power. But you learn in another place that he
does not mean any one of the angels as a mediator, but the Lord
Jesus Christ Himself, in so far as He deigned to be made man:
&#8220;For there is one God,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and one Mediator between
God and man, the man Christ Jesus.&#8221;<note place="end" n="433" id="iv.i.v.xii-p28.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.v.xii-p29"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. ii. 5" id="iv.i.v.xii-p29.2" parsed="|1Tim|2|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.2.5">1 Tim. ii. 5</scripRef></p></note> Hence that passover in the killing

those things which are figuratively spoken in the Law, of Christ to
come in the flesh, and to suffer, but also to rise again, which Law
was given by the disposition of angels; in which angels, were
certainly the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; and in
which, sometimes the Father, sometimes the Son, sometimes the Holy
Spirit, and sometimes God, without any distinction of person, was
figuratively signified by them, although appearing in visible and
sensible forms, yet by His own creature, not by His substance, in
order to the seeing of which, hearts are cleansed through all those
things which are seen by the eyes and heard by the ears.</p>

discussed and demonstrated, according to our capacity; and it has
been established, both by probable reason, so far as a man, or
rather, so far as I am able, and by strength of authority, so far
as the divine declarations from the Holy Scriptures have been made
clear, that those words and bodily appearances which were given to
these ancient fathers of ours before the incarnation of the
Saviour, when God was said to appear, were wrought by angels:
whether themselves speaking or doing something in the person of
God, as we have shown that the prophets also were wont to do, or
assuming from the creature that which they themselves were not,
wherein God might be shown in a figure to men; which manner of
showing also, Scripture teaches by many examples, that the
prophets, too, did not omit. It remains, therefore, now for us to
consider,&#8212;since both in the Lord as born of a virgin, and in the

was sent, viz, that by Christ&#8217;s dying for sinners, we were to be
convinced how great is God&#8217;s love for us, and also what manner of
men we are whom He loved. That the Word came in the flesh, to the
purpose also of enabling us to be so cleansed as to contemplate and
cleave to God. That our double death was abolished by His death,
being one and single. And hereupon is discussed, how the single of
our Saviour harmonizes to salvation with our double; and the
perfection is treated at length of the senary number, to which the
ratio itself of single to double is reducible. That all are
gathered together from many into one by the one Mediator of life,
viz. Christ, through Whom alone is wrought the true cleansing of
the soul. Further it is demonstrated that the Son of God, although
made less by being sent, on account of the form of a servant which
He took, is not therefore less than the Father according to the
form of God, because He was sent by Himself: and that the same
account is to be given of the sending of the Holy
Spirit.</p>

The</span>knowledge of things terrestrial and
celestial is commonly thought much of by men. Yet those doubtless
judge better who prefer to that knowledge, the knowledge of
themselves; and that mind is more praiseworthy which knows even its
own weakness, than that which, without regard to this, searches
out, and even comes to know, the ways of the stars, or which holds
fast such knowledge already acquired, while ignorant of the way by
which itself to enter into its own proper health and strength. But
if any one has already become awake towards God, kindled by the
warmth of the Holy Spirit, and in the love of God has become vile
in his own eyes; and through wishing, yet not having strength to
come in unto Him, and through the light He gives, has given heed to
himself, and has found himself, and has learned that his own
filthiness cannot mingle with His purity; and feels it sweet to
weep and to entreat Him, that again and again He will have
compassion, until he have put off all his wretchedness; and to pray
confidently, as having already received of free gift the pledge of
salvation through his only Saviour and Enlightener of man:&#8212;such

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.ii-p2">2. But since we are exiled from the
unchangeable joy, yet neither cut off nor torn away from it so that
we should not seek eternity, truth, blessedness, even in those
changeable and temporal things (for we wish neither to die, nor to
be deceived, nor to be troubled); visions have been sent to us from
heaven suitable to our state of pilgrimage, in order to remind us
that what we seek is not here, but that from this pilgrimage we
must return thither, whence unless we originated we should not here
seek these things. And first we have had to be persuaded how much
God loved us, lest from despair we should not dare to look up to
Him. And we needed to be shown also what manner of men we are whom
He loved, lest being proud, as if of our own merits, we should
recede the more from Him, and fail the more in our own strength.
And hence He so dealt with us, that we might the rather profit by
His strength, and that so in the weakness of humility the virtue of
charity might be perfected. And this is intimated in the Psalm,
where it is said, &#8220;Thou, O God, didst send a spontaneous rain,
whereby Thou didst make Thine inheritance perfect, when it was
weary.&#8221;<note place="end" n="442" id="iv.i.vi.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.ii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lxviii. 9" id="iv.i.vi.ii-p3.2" parsed="|Ps|68|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.68.9">Ps. lxviii. 9</scripRef>.&#8212;<i>Pluviam

He gave it, not because we were worthy, but because He willed. And
knowing this, we shall not trust in ourselves; and this is to be
made &#8220;weak.&#8221; But He Himself makes us perfect, who says also to
the Apostle Paul, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for thee, for my

while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then,

God is One, by which all things were made, which is the
unchangeable truth, all things are simultaneously therein,
potentially and unchangeably; not only those things which are now
in this whole creation, but also those which have been and those
which shall be. And therein they neither have been, nor shall be,
but only <i>are</i>; and all things are life, and all things are
one; or rather it is one being and one life. For all things were so
made by Him, that whatsoever was made in them was not made in Him,
but was life in Him. Since, &#8220;in the beginning,&#8221; the Word was
not made, but &#8220;the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and
all things were made by Him;&#8221; neither had all things been made by
Him, unless He had Himself been before all things and not made. But
in those things which were made by Him, even body, which is not
life, would not have been made by Him, except it had been life in
Him before it was made. For &#8220;that which was made was already life
in Him;&#8221; and not life of any kind soever: for the soul also is
the life of the body, but this too is made, for it is <pb n="71" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_71.html" id="iv.i.vi.ii-Page_71"/>changeable;
and by what was it made, except by the unchangeable Word of God?
For &#8220;all things were made by Him; and without Him was not
anything made that was made.&#8221; &#8220;What, therefore, was made was
already life in Him;&#8221; and not any kind of life, but &#8220;the life
[which] was the light of men;&#8221; the light certainly of rational
minds, by which men differ from beasts, and therefore are men.
Therefore not corporeal light, which is the light of the flesh,
whether it shine from heaven, or whether it be lighted by earthly
fires; nor that of human flesh only, but also that of beasts, and
down even to the minutest of worms. For all these things see that
light: but that life was the light of men; nor is it far from any
one of us, for in it &#8220;we live, and move, and have our being.&#8221;<note place="end" n="447" id="iv.i.vi.ii-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.ii-p9"> <scripRef passage="Acts xvii. 27, 28" id="iv.i.vi.ii-p9.2" parsed="|Acts|17|27|17|28" osisRef="Bible:Acts.17.27-Acts.17.28">Acts xvii. 27, 28</scripRef></p></note></p>

of the Word, namely, of that life which is the light of men. But
for this partaking we were utterly unfit, and fell short of it, on
account of the uncleanness of sins. Therefore we were to be
cleansed. And further, the one cleansing of the unrighteous and of
the proud is the blood of the Righteous One, and the humbling of
God Himself;<note place="end" n="448" id="iv.i.vi.iii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.iii-p3"> <scripRef passage="John i. 1, 14" id="iv.i.vi.iii-p3.2" parsed="|John|1|1|0|0;|John|1|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.1 Bible:John.1.14">John i. 1, 14</scripRef></p></note> that we
might be cleansed through Him, made as He was what we are by
nature, and what we are not by sin, that we might contemplate God,
which by nature we are not. For by nature we are not God: by nature
we are men, by sin we are not righteous. Wherefore God, made a
righteous man, interceded with God for man the sinner. For the
sinner is not congruous to the righteous, but man is congruous to
man. By joining therefore to us the likeness of His humanity, He
took away the unlikeness of our unrighteousness; and by being made
partaker of our mortality, He made us partakers of His divinity.
For the death of the sinner springing from the necessity of
comdemnation is deservedly abolished by the death of the Righteous
One springing from the free choice of His compassion, while His
single [death and resurrection] answers to our double [death and
resurrection].<note place="end" n="449" id="iv.i.vi.iii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.iii-p4"> [This singleness and doubleness is

congruity, or suitableness, or concord, or consonance, or whatever
more appropriate word there may be, whereby one is [united] to two,

I mean is precisely that co-adaptation which the Greeks call

this is not the place to set forth the power of that consonance of
single to double which is found especially in us, and which is
naturally so implanted in us (and by whom, except by Him who
created us?), that not even the ignorant can fail to perceive it,
whether when singing themselves or hearing others. For by this it
is that treble and bass voices are in harmony, so that any one who
in his note departs from it, offends extremely, not only trained
skill, of which the most part of men are devoid, but the very sense
of hearing. To demonstrate this, needs no doubt a long discourse;
but any one who knows it, may make it plain to the very ear in a
rightly ordered monochord.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.iv-p2">5. But for our present need we must
discuss, so far as God gives us power, in what manner the single of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ answers to, and is, so to say, in
harmony with our double to the effect of salvation. We certainly,
as no Christian doubts, are dead both in soul and body: in soul,
because of sin; in body, because of the punishment of sin, and
through this also in body because of sin. And to both these parts
of ourselves, that is, both to soul and to body, there was need
both of a medicine and of resurrection, that what had been changed
for the worse might be renewed for the better. Now the death of the
soul is ungodliness, and the death of the body is corruptibility,
through which comes also a departure of the soul from the body. For
as the soul dies when God leaves it, so the body dies when the soul
leaves it; whereby the former becomes foolish, the latter lifeless.
For the soul is raised up again by repentance, and the renewing of
life is begun in the body still mortal by faith, by which men
believe on Him who justi<pb n="72" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_72.html" id="iv.i.vi.iv-Page_72"/>fies the ungodly;<note place="end" n="450" id="iv.i.vi.iv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.iv-p3"> <scripRef passage="Rom. iv. 5" id="iv.i.vi.iv-p3.2" parsed="|Rom|4|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.4.5">Rom. iv. 5</scripRef></p></note> and it is

of ours our Saviour bestowed His own single death; and to cause
both our resurrections, He appointed beforehand and set forth in
mystery and type His own one resurrection. For He was not a sinner
or ungodly, that, as though dead in spirit, He should need to be
renewed in the inner man, and to be recalled as it were to the life
of righteousness by repentance; but being clothed in mortal flesh,
and in that alone dying, in that alone rising again, in that alone
did He answer to both for us; since in it was wrought a mystery as
regards the inner man, and a type as regards the outer. For it was

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.v-p2">7. Now this ratio of the single to
the double arises, no doubt, from the ternary number, since one
added to two makes three; but the whole which these make reaches to
the senary, for one and two and three make six. And this number is
on that account called perfect, because it is completed in its own
parts: for it has these three, sixth, third, and half; nor is there
any other part found in it, which we can call an aliquot part. The
sixth part of it, then, is one; the third part, two; the half,
three. But one and two and three complete the same six. And Holy
Scripture commends to us the perfection of this number, especially
in this, that God finished His works in six days, and on the sixth
day man was made in the image of God.<note place="end" n="479" id="iv.i.vi.v-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.v-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. i. 27" id="iv.i.vi.v-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|1|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.27">Gen. i. 27</scripRef></p></note> And the Son of God came and was
made the Son of man, that He might re-create us after the image of
God, in the sixth age of the human race. For that is now the
present age, whether a thousand years apiece are assigned to each
age, or whether we trace out memorable and remarkable epochs or
turning-points of time in the divine Scriptures, so that the first
age is to be found from Adam until Noah, and the second thence
onwards to Abraham, and then next, after the division of Matthew
the evangelist, from Abraham to David, from David to the carrying
away to Babylon, and from thence to the travail of the Virgin,<note place="end" n="480" id="iv.i.vi.v-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.v-p4"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 1.17" id="iv.i.vi.v-p4.1" parsed="|Matt|1|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.1.17">Matt. i. 17</scripRef></p></note> which three
ages joined to those other two make five. Accordingly, the nativity
of the Lord began the sixth, which is now going onwards until the
hidden end of time. We recognize also in this senary number a kind
of figure of time, in that threefold mode of division, by which we
compute one portion of time before the Law; a second, under the
Law; a third, under grace. In which last time we have received the
sacrament of renewal, that we may be renewed also in the end of
time, in every part, by the resurrection of the flesh, and so may
be made whole from our entire infirmity, not only of soul, but also
of body. And thence that woman is understood to be a type of the
church, who was made whole and upright by the Lord, after she had
been bowed by infirmity through the binding of Satan. For those
words of the Psalm lament such hidden enemies: &#8220;They bowed down
my soul.&#8221;<note place="end" n="481" id="iv.i.vi.v-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.v-p5"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lvii. 6" id="iv.i.vi.v-p5.2" parsed="|Ps|57|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.57.6">Ps. lvii. 6</scripRef></p></note> And this

the third year of its miserable barrenness. But intercession was
made for it, that it might be let alone that year, that year, that

six.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.v-p7">8. A single year also, if the whole
twelve months are taken into account, which are made up of thirty
days each (for the month that has been kept from of old is that
which the revolution of the moon determines), abounds in the number
six. For that which six is, in the first order of numbers, which
consists of units up to ten, that sixty is in the second order,
which consists of tens up to a hundred. Sixty days, then, are a
sixth part of the year. Further, if that which stands as the sixth
of the second order is multiplied by the sixth of the first order,
then we make six times sixty, <i>i.e.</i> three hundred and sixty
days, which are the whole twelve months. But since, as the
revolution of the moon determines the month for men, so the year is
marked by the revolution of the sun; and five days and a quarter of
a day remain, that the sun may fulfill its course and end the year;
for four quarters make one day, which must be intercalated in every
fourth year, which they call bissextile, that the order of time may
not be disturbed: if we consider, also, these five days and a
quarter themselves, the number six prevails in them. First,
because, as it is usual to compute the whole from a part, we must
not call it five days, but rather six, taking the quarter days for
one day. Next, because five days themselves are the sixth part of a
month; while the quarter of a day contains six hours. For the
entire day, <i>i.e.</i> including its night, is twenty-four hours,
of which the fourth part, which is a quarter of a day, is found to
be six hours. So much in the course of the year does the sixth
number prevail.</p>

itself of the body of the Lord is found to have been brought in so
many days to the birth, as the authority of the church maintains
upon the tradition of the elders. For He is believed to have been
conceived on the 25th of March, upon which day also He suffered; so
the womb of the Virgin, in which He was conceived, where no one of
mortals was begotten, corresponds to the new grave in which He was
buried, wherein was never man laid,<note place="end" n="484" id="iv.i.vi.vi-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.vi-p4"> <scripRef passage="John xix. 41, 42" id="iv.i.vi.vi-p4.2" parsed="|John|19|41|19|42" osisRef="Bible:John.19.41-John.19.42">John xix. 41, 42</scripRef></p></note> neither before nor since.

the space of those three days themselves was not whole and entire,

third day is itself also counted as a whole from its first part;
but the intervening day, <i>i.e.</i> the second day, was absolutely
a whole with its twenty-four hours, twelve of the day and twelve of
the night. For He was crucified first by the voices of the Jews in
the third hour, when it was the sixth day of the week. Then He hung

understand that He was suspended on the cross at the third

be reckoned then an entire day from its last part, as the third

resurrection of the Lord was made known, belongs to the third day;
because God (who commanded <pb n="75" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_75.html" id="iv.i.vi.vii-Page_75"/>the light to shine out of

to us in some way that the day takes its beginning from the night.
For as the first days of all were reckoned from light to night, on
account of the future fall of man;<note place="end" n="492" id="iv.i.vi.vii-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.vii-p8"> <scripRef passage="Gen. i. 4, 5" id="iv.i.vi.vii-p8.2" parsed="|Gen|1|4|1|5" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.4-Gen.1.5">Gen. i. 4, 5</scripRef></p></note> so these on account of the
restoration of man, are reckoned from darkness to light. From the
hour, then, of His death to the dawn of the resurrection are forty
hours, counting in also the ninth hour itself. And with this number
agrees also His life upon earth of forty days after His
resurrection. And this number is most frequently used in Scripture
to express the mystery of perfection in the fourfold world. For the
number ten has a certain perfection, and that multiplied by four
makes forty. But from the evening of the burial to the dawn of the
resurrection are thirty-six hours which is six squared. And this is
referred to that ratio of the single to the double wherein there is
the greatest consonance of co-adaptation. For twelve added to
twenty-four suits the ratio of single added to double and makes
thirty-six: namely a whole night with a whole day and a whole
night, and this not without the mystery which I have noticed above.
For not unfitly do we liken the spirit to the day and the body to
the night. For the body of the Lord in His death and resurrection
was a figure of our spirit and a type of our body. In this way,
then, also that ratio of the single to the double is apparent in
the thirty-six hours, when twelve are added to twenty-four. As to
the reasons, indeed, why these numbers are so put in the Holy
Scriptures, other people may trace out other reasons, either such
that those which I have given are to be preferred to them, or such
as are equally probable with mine, or even more probable than they
are; but there is no one surely so foolish or so absurd as to
contend that they are so put in the Scriptures for no purpose at
all, and that there are no mystical reasons why those numbers are
there mentioned. But those reasons which I have here given, I have
either gathered from the authority of the church, according to the
tradition of our forefathers, or from the testimony of the divine

this priest, this God, before He was sent and came, being made of a
woman&#8212;of Him, all those things which appeared to our fathers in a
sacred and mystical way by angelical miracles, or which were done
by the fathers themselves, were similitudes; in order that every
creature by its acts might speak in some way of that One who was to
be, in whom there was to be salvation in the recovery of all from
death. For because by the wickedness of ungodliness we had recoiled
and fallen away in discord from the one true and supreme God, and
had in many things become vain, being distracted through many
things and cleaving fast to many things; it was needful, by the
decree and command of God in His mercy, that those same many things
should join in proclaiming the One that should come, and that One
should come so proclaimed by these many things, and that these many
things should join in witnessing that this One had come; and that
so, freed from the burden of these many things, we should come to
that One, and dead as we were in our souls by many sins, and
destined to die in the flesh on account of sin, that we should love
that One who, without sin, died in the flesh for us; and by
believing in Him now raised again, and by rising again with Him in
the spirit through faith, that we should be justified by being made
one in the one righteous One; and that we should not despair of our
own resurrection in the flesh itself, when we consider that the one
Head had gone before us the many members; in whom, being now
cleansed through faith, and then renewed by sight, and through Him
as mediator reconciled to God, we are to cleave to the One, to
feast upon the One, to continue one.</p>

worthless spirits to do many things by means of aerial bodies, such
as to cause wonder to souls which are weighed down by earthly
bodies, even though they be of the better inclined. For if earthly
bodies themselves, when trained by a certain skill and practice,
exhibit to men so great marvels in theatrical spectacles, that they
who never saw such things scarcely believe them when told; why
should it be hard for the devil and his angels to make out of
corporeal elements, through their own aerial bodies, things at
which the flesh marvels; or even by hidden inspirations to contrive
fantastic appearances to the deluding of men&#8217;s senses, whereby to
deceive them, whether awake or asleep, or to drive them into
frenzy? But just as it may happen that one who is better than they
in life and character may gaze at the most worthless of men, either
walking on a rope, or doing by various motions of the body many
things difficult of belief, and yet he may not at all desire to do
such things, nor think those men on that account to be preferred to
himself; so the faithful and pious soul, not only if it sees, but
even if on account of the frailty of the flesh it shudders at, the

of virtues so as to fly upwards, but rather to heap up the weight

thereby brought it to pass that we deserved to come into the death
of the flesh. We desired therefore the one through wicked

yet did not come himself, that is, to the death of the flesh, there

solicitous; but not to die, although it be not within reach of
attainment, is yet eagerly sought after); the Mediator of life,
making it plain that death is not to be feared, which by the
condition of humanity cannot now be escaped, but rather
ungodliness, which can be guarded against through faith, meets us
at the end to which we have come, but not by the way by which we
came. For we, indeed, came to death through sin; He through
righteousness: and, therefore, as our death is the punishment of
sin, so His death was made a sacrifice for sin.</p>

God has left it, but the death of the body that the spirit has left
it; and since herein lies the punishment in the death of the body,
that the spirit leaves the body against its will, because it left
God willingly; so that, whereas the spirit left God because it
would, it leaves the body although it would not; nor leaves it when
it would, unless it has offered violence to itself, whereby the
body itself is slain: the spirit of the Mediator showed how it was
through no punishment of sin that He came to the death of the
flesh, because He did not leave it against His will, but because He
willed, when He willed, as He willed. For because He is so
commingled [with the flesh] by the Word of God as to be one, He
says: &#8220;I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take
it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay down my life that I

resurrection, which should be at once a mystery of our renewal, and
a type of that waking up which is to be in the end. He then who
being alive in the spirit raised again His own flesh that was dead,
the true Mediator of life, has cast out him, who is dead in the
spirit and the mediator of death, from the spirits of those who
believe in Himself, so that he should not reign within, but should
assault from without, and yet not prevail. And to him, too, He
offered Himself to be tempted, in order that He might be also a
mediator to overcome his temptations, not only by succor, but also
by example. But when the devil, from the first, although striving
through every entrance to creep into His inward parts, was thrust

he forced no entrance into Him who was alive in the spirit, he
betook himself, through eagerness for the death of man in any way
whatsoever, to effecting that death which he could, and was
permitted to effect it upon that mortal element which the living
Mediator had received from us. And where he could do anything,
there in every respect he was conquered; and wherein he received
outwardly the power of slaying the Lord in the flesh, therein his
inward power, by which he held ourselves, was slain. For it was
brought to pass that the bonds of many sins in many deaths were
loosed, through the one death of One which no sin had preceded.
Which death, though not due, the Lord therefore rendered for us,
that the death which was due might work us no hurt. For He was not
stripped of the flesh by obligation of any authority, but He
stripped Himself. For doubtless He who was able not to die, if He
would not, did die because He would: and so He made a show of

drove the sinner to fall, himself not following, there by following
he compelled the Redeemer to descend. And so the Son of God deigned
to become our friend in the fellowship of death, to which because
he came not, the enemy thought himself to be better and greater
than ourselves. For our Redeemer says, &#8220;Greater love hath no man
than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.&#8221;<note place="end" n="515" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p9"> <scripRef passage="John xv. 13" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p9.2" parsed="|John|15|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.15.13">John xv. 13</scripRef></p></note> Wherefore

those who are his own until this very day, to whom he presents
himself as a false mediator, as though they would be cleansed or

persuades the proud to ridicule and despise the death of Christ,
from which the more he himself is estranged, the more is he
believed by them to be the holier and more divine. Yet those who
have remained with him are very few, since the nations acknowledge
and with pious humility imbibe the price paid for themselves, and
in trust upon it abandon their enemy, and gather together to their
Redeemer. For the devil does not know how the most excellent wisdom
of God makes use of both his snares and his fury to bring about the
salvation of His own faithful ones, beginning from the former end,
which is the beginning of the spiritual creature, even to the
latter end, which is the death of the body, and so &#8220;reaching from
the one end to the other, mightily and sweetly ordering all
things.&#8221;<note place="end" n="518" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p13"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. viii. 1" id="iv.i.vi.xiv-p13.2" parsed="|Wis|8|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.8.1">Wisd. viii. 1</scripRef></p></note> For wisdom

back the former death, and also men, to that miserable condition of
nature, which is derived from the first sin, and will be cast down
into the latter death with the devil. And they on this account
preferred the devil to Christ, because the former cast them into
that former death, whither he himself fell not through the
difference of his nature, and whither on account of them Christ
descended through His great mercy: and yet they do not hesitate to
believe themselves better than the devils, and do not cease to
assail and denounce them with every sort of malediction, while they
know them at any rate to have nothing to do with the suffering of
this kind of death, on account of which they despise Christ.
Neither will they take into account that the case may possibly be,
that the Word of God, remaining in Himself, and in Himself in no
way changeable, may yet, through the taking upon Him of a lower
nature, be able to suffer somewhat of a lower kind, which the
unclean spirit cannot suffer, because he has not an earthly body.
And so, whereas they themselves are better than the devils, yet,
because they bear a body of flesh, they can so die, as the devils
certainly cannot die, who do not bear such a body. They presume
much on the deaths of their own sacrifices, which they do not
perceive that they sacrifice to deceitful and proud spirits; or if
they have come to perceive it, think their friendship to be of some
good to themselves, treacherous and envious although they are,
whose purpose is bent upon nothing else except to hinder our
return.</p>

be consulted concerning the revolutions of mutable things, or
concerning the connected order of the ages. For pray, because they
dispute most truly, and persuade us by most certain proofs, that
all things temporal are made after a science that is eternal, are
they therefore able to see clearly in the matter of this science
itself, or to collect from it, how many kinds of animals there are,
what are the seeds of each in their beginnings, what measure in
their increase, what numbers run through their conceptions, births,
ages, settings; what motions in desiring things according to their
nature, and in avoiding the contrary? Have they not sought out all
these things, not through that unchangeable wisdom, but through the
actual history of places and times, or have trusted the written
experience of others? Wherefore it is the less to be wondered at,
that they have utterly failed in searching out the succession of
more lengthened ages, and in finding any goal of that course, down
which, as though down a river, the human race is sailing, and the
transition thence of each to its own appropriate end. For these are
subjects which historians could not describe, inasmuch as they are
far in the future, and have been experienced and related by no one.

in that high and eternal science, been able to grasp such subjects
with the understanding; otherwise they would not be inquiring as
they could into past things of the kind, such as are in the
province of historians, but rather would foreknow also things
future; and those who are able to do this are called by them
soothsayers, but by us prophets:</p>

they themselves have noted by experience; or as again husbandmen,
or sailors, too, foretell many things; for if such predictions are
made a long while before, they are thought to be divinations), or
whether such things have already started on their road to come to
us, and being seen coming far off, are announced in proportion to
the acuteness of the sense of those who see them, by doing which
the aerial powers are thought to divine (just as if a person from
the top of a mountain were to see far off some one coming, and were
to announce it beforehand to those who dwelt close by in the
plain); or whether they are either fore-announced to certain men,
or are heard by them and again transmitted to other men, by means
of holy angels, to whom God shows those things by His Word and His
Wisdom, wherein both things future and things past consist: or
whether the minds of certain men themselves are so far borne
upwards by theHoly Spirit, as to behold, not through the angels,
but of themselves, the immoveable <pb n="81" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_81.html" id="iv.i.vi.xviii-Page_81"/>causes of things future, in that

for the aerial powers, too, <i>hear</i> these things, either by
message through angels, or through men; and hear only so much as He
judges to be fitting, to whom all things are subject. Many things,

they were not fit to fix the eye of the mind so firmly upon the

see, in the wisdom itself of the Creator and Governor of the

already and were always, but here were about to be so that as yet
they were not; or, again, to see therein those changes for the
better, not of the souls only, but also of the bodies of men, even
to the perfection of their proper measure; whereas then, I say,
they were in no way fit to see these things therein, they were not
even judged worthy of receiving any announcement of them by the
holy angels; whether externally through the senses of the body, or
by interior revelations exhibited in the spirit; as these things
actually were manifested to our fathers, who were gifted with true
piety, and who by foretelling them, obtaining credence either by
present signs, or by events close at hand, which turned out as they
had foretold, earned authority to be believed respecting things
remotely future, even to the end of the world. But the proud and
deceitful powers of the air, even if they are found to have said
through their soothsayers some things of the fellowship and
citizenship of the saints, and of the true Mediator, which they
heard from the holy prophets or the angels, did so with the purpose
of seducing even the faithful ones of God, if they could, by these
alien truths, to revolt to their own proper falsehoods. But God did
this by those who knew not what they said, in order that the truth
might sound abroad from all sides, to aid the faithful, to be a
witness against the ungodly.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.xix-p2">24. Since, then, we were not fit to
take hold of things eternal, and since the foulness of sins weighed
us down, which we had contracted by the love of temporal things,
and which were implanted in us as it were naturally, from the root
of mortality, it was needful that we should be cleansed. But
cleansed we could not be, so as to be tempered together with things
eternal, except it were through things temporal, wherewith we were
already tempered together and held fast. For health is at the
opposite extreme from disease; but the intermediate process of
healing does not lead us to perfect health, unless it has some
congruity with the disease. Things temporal that are useless merely
deceive the sick; things temporal that are useful take up those
that need healing, and pass them on healed, to things eternal. And
the rational mind, as when cleansed it owes contemplation to things
eternal; so, when needing cleansing, owes faith to things temporal.
One even of those who were formerly esteemed wise men among the
Greeks has said, The truth stands to faith in the same relation in
which eternity stands to that which has a beginning. And he is no
doubt right in saying so. For what we call temporal, he describes
as having had a beginning. And we also ourselves come under this
kind, not only in respect to the body, but also in respect to the
changeableness of the soul. For that is not properly called eternal
which undergoes any degree of change. Therefore, in so far as we
are changeable, in so far we stand apart from eternity. But life
eternal is promised to us through the truth, from the clear
knowledge of which, again, our faith stands as far apart as
mortality does from eternity. We then now put faith in things done
in time on our account, and by that faith itself we are cleansed;
in order that when we have come to sight, as truth follows faith,
so eternity may follow upon mortality. And therefore, since our
faith will become truth, when we have attained to that which is
promised to us who believe: and that which is promised us is
eternal life; and the Truth (not that which shall come to be
according as our faith shall be, but that truth which is always,
because in it is eternity,&#8212;the Truth then) has said, &#8220;And this
is life eternal, that <pb n="82" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_82.html" id="iv.i.vi.xix-Page_82"/>they might know Thee the only

faith by seeing shall come to be truth, then eternity shall possess
our now changed mortality. And until this shall take place, and in
order that it may take place,&#8212;because we adapt the faith of
belief to things which have a beginning, as in things eternal we
hope for the truth of contemplation, lest the faith of mortal life
should be at discord with the truth of eternal life,&#8212;the Truth
itself, co-eternal with the Father, took a beginning from earth,<note place="end" n="529" id="iv.i.vi.xix-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.xix-p4"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lxxxv. 11" id="iv.i.vi.xix-p4.2" parsed="|Ps|85|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.85.11">Ps. lxxxv. 11</scripRef></p></note> when the Son
of God so came as to become the Son of man, and to take to Himself
our faith, that He might thereby lead us on to His own truth, who
so undertook our mortality, as not to lose His own eternity. For
truth stands to faith in the relation in which eternity stands to
that which has a beginning. Therefore, we must needs so be
cleansed, that we may come to have such a beginning as remains
eternal, that we may not have one beginning in faith, and another
in truth. Neither could we pass to things eternal from the
condition of having a beginning, unless we were transferred, by
union of the eternal to ourselves through our own beginning, to His
own eternity. Therefore our faith has, in some measure, now
followed thither, whither He in whom we have believed has ascended;
born,<note place="end" n="530" id="iv.i.vi.xix-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.xix-p5"> Ortus.</p></note> dead, risen
again, taken up. Of these four things, we knew the first two in
ourselves. For we know that men both have a beginning and die. But
the remaining two, that is, to be raised, and to be taken up, we
rightly hope will be in us, because we have believed them done in
Him. Since, therefore, in Him that, too, which had a beginning has
passed over to eternity, in ourselves also it will so pass over,
when faith shall have arrived at truth. For to those who thus
believe, in order that they might remain in the word of faith, and
being thence led on to the truth, and through that to eternity,
might be freed from death, He speaks thus: &#8220;If ye continue in my
word, then are ye my disciples indeed.&#8221; And as though they would
ask, With what fruit? He proceeds to say, &#8220;And ye shall know the
truth.&#8221; And again, as though they would say, Of what good is
truth to mortal men? &#8220;And the truth,&#8221; He says, &#8220;shall make

who as lowly was sent to the lowly. For the heaven and the earth
and all things in them are incomparably greater works of the Son of
God, since all things were made by Him, than the signs and the
portents which broke forth in testimony of Him. But yet men, in
order that, being lowly, they might believe these great things to
have been wrought by Him, trembled at those lowly things, as if
they had been great.</p>

the fathers, when certain angelical visions were shown to them,

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.xxi-p2">27. But if the Son is said to be
sent by the Father on this account, that the one is the Father, and
the other the Son, this does not in any manner hinder us from
believing the Son to be equal, and consubstantial, and co-eternal
with the Father, and yet to have been sent as Son by the Father.
Not because the one is greater, the other less; but because the one
is Father, the other Son; the one begetter, the other begotten; the
one, He from whom He is who is sent; the other, He who is from Him
who sends. For the Son is from the Father, not the Father from the
Son. And according to this manner we can now understand that the
Son is not only said to have been sent because &#8220;the Word was made
flesh,&#8221;<note place="end" n="534" id="iv.i.vi.xxi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.xxi-p3"> <scripRef passage="John i. 3, 18, 14" id="iv.i.vi.xxi-p3.2" parsed="|John|1|3|0|0;|John|1|18|0|0;|John|1|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.3 Bible:John.1.18 Bible:John.1.14">John i. 3, 18, 14</scripRef></p></note> but
therefore sent that the Word might be made flesh, and that He might
perform through His bodily presence those things which were
written; that is, that not only is He understood to have been sent
as man, which the Word was made but the Word, too, was sent that it
might be made man; because He was not sent in respect to any
inequality of power, or substance, or anything that in Him was not
equal to the Father; but in respect to this, that the Son is from
the Father, not the Father from the Son; for the Son is the Word of
the Father, which is also called His wisdom. What wonder,
therefore, if He is sent, not because He is unequal with the
Father, but because He is &#8220;a pure emanation (<i>manatio</i>)
issuing from the glory of the Almighty God?&#8221; For there, that
which issues, and that from which it issues, is of one and the same
substance. For it does not issue as water issues from an aperture
of earth or of stone, but as light issues from light. For the
words, &#8220;For she is the brightness of the everlasting light,&#8221;
what else are they than, she is light of everlasting light? For
what is the brightness of light, except light itself? and so
co-eternal, with the light, from which the light is. But it is
preferable to say, &#8220;the brightness of light,&#8221; rather than&#8221;
the light of light;&#8221; lest that which issues should be thought to
be darker than that from which it issues. For when one hears of the
brightness of light as being light itself, it is more easy to
believe that the former shines by means of the latter, than that
the latter shines less. But because there was no need of warning
men not to think that light to be less, which begat the other (for
no heretic ever dared say this, neither is it to be believed that
any one will dare to do so), Scripture meets that other thought,
whereby that light which issues might seem darker than that from
which it issues; and it has removed this surmise by saying, &#8220;It
is the brightness of that light,&#8221; namely, of eternal light, and
so shows it to be equal. For if it were less, then it would be its
darkness, not its brightness; but if it were greater, then it could
not issue from it, for it could not surpass that from which it is
educed. Therefore, because it issues from it, it is not greater
than it is; and because it is not its darkness, but its brightness,
it is not less than it is: therefore it is equal. Nor ought this to
trouble us, that it is called a pure emanation issuing from the
glory of the Almighty God, as if itself were not omnipotent, but an
emanation from the Omnipotent; for soon after it is said of it,
&#8220;And being but one, she can do all things.&#8221;<note place="end" n="535" id="iv.i.vi.xxi-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.xxi-p4"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. vii. 25-27" id="iv.i.vi.xxi-p4.2" parsed="|Wis|7|25|7|27" osisRef="Bible:Wis.7.25-Wis.7.27">Wisd. vii. 25&#8211;27</scripRef></p></note> But who is omnipotent, unless He

be the salvation of those wise and holy men also, who, before He

apprehended and perceived by each, in so far as He can be
apprehended and perceived, in proportion to the comprehension of
the rational soul, either advancing towards God, or already perfect
in God. The Son, therefore, is not properly said to have been sent

grasping with the mind as far as we can that which is eternal; and
the spirits of all the righteous are not in this world, even of
those who are still living in the flesh, in so far as they have
discernment in things divine. But the Father is not said to be
sent, when from time to time He is apprehended by any one, for He
has no one of whom to be, or from whom to proceed; since Wisdom

deity,&#8221; with reference to the personal distinctions of Father,
Son, and Spirit&#8212;the Son being from the Father, and the Spirit
from Father and Son. The trinitarian relations or modes of the
essence, &#8220;begin&#8221; with the first person, not the second or the
third. The phrase &#8220;whole deity,&#8221; in the above statement, is put
for &#8220;trinity,&#8221; not for &#8220;essence.&#8221; Augustin would not say
that the Father is the &#8220;beginning&#8221; (<i>principium</i>) of the
divine essence considered abstractly, but only of the essence as

Father &#8220;<i>fons trinitatis,</i>&#8221; and sometimes &#8220;<i>fons

dare to say that nothing of the kind was done aforetime. But I
would boldly say, that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, of one and
the same substance, God the Creator, the Omnipotent Trinity, work
indivisibly; but that this cannot be indivisibly manifested by the
creature, which is far inferior, and least of all by the bodily
creature: just as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit cannot be named
by our words, which certainly are bodily sounds, except in their
own proper intervals of time, divided by a distinct separation,
which intervals the proper syllables of each word occupy. Since in
their proper substance wherein they are, the three are one, the
Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, the very same, by no
temporal motion, above the whole creature, without any interval of
time and place, and at once one and the same from eternity to
eternity, as it were eternity itself, which is not without
truth <pb n="86" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_86.html" id="iv.i.vi.xxii-Page_86"/>and charity. But, in my words, the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit are separated, and cannot be named at once, and occupy their
own proper places separately invisible letters. And as, when I name
my memory, and intellect, and will, each name refers to each
severally, but yet each is uttered by all three; for there is no
one of these three names that is not uttered by both my memory and
my intellect and my will together [by the soul as a whole]; so the
Trinity together wrought both the voice of the Father, and the
flesh of the Son, and the dove of the Holy Spirit, while each of
these things is referred severally to each person. And by this
similitude it is in some degree discernible, that the Trinity,
which is inseparable in itself, is manifested separably by the
appearance of the visible creature; and that the operation of the
Trinity is also inseparable in each severally of those things which
are said to pertain properly to the manifesting of either the
Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.xxii-p6">31. If then I am asked, in what
manner either words or sensible forms and appearances were wrought
before the incarnation of the Word of God, which should prefigure
it as about to come, I reply that God wrought those things by the
angels; and this I have also shown sufficiently, as I think, by
testimonies of the Holy Scriptures. And if I am asked how the
incarnation itself was brought to pass, I reply that the Word of
God itself was made flesh, that is, was made man, yet not turned
and changed into that which was made; but so made, that there
should be there not only the Word of God and the flesh of man, but
also the rational soul of man, and that this whole should both be
called God on account of God, and man on account of man. And if
this is understood with difficulty, the mind must be purged by
faith, by more and more abstaining from sins, and by doing good
works, and by praying with the groaning of holy desires; that by
profiting through the divine help, it may both understand and love.
And if I am asked, how, after the incarnation of the Word, either a
voice of the Father was produced, or a corporeal appearance by
which the Holy Spirit was manifested: I do not doubt indeed that
this was done through the creature; but whether only corporeal and
sensible, or whether by the employment also of the spirit rational
or intellectual (for this is the term by which some choose to call
what the Greeks name 
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.vi.xxii-p6.1">&#957;&#959;&#949;&#961;&#8057;&#957;</span>), not certainly so as
to form one person (for who could possibly say that whatever
creature it was by which the voice of the Father sounded, is in
such sense God the Father; or whatever creature it was by which the
Holy Spirit was manifested in the form of a dove, or in fiery
tongues, is in such sense the Holy Spirit, as the Son of God is
that man who was made of a virgin?), but only to the ministry of
bringing about such intimations as God judged needful; or whether
anything else is to be understood: is difficult to discover, and
not expedient rashly to affirm. Yet I see not how those things
could have been brought to pass without the rational or
intellectual creature. But it is not yet the proper place to
explain, as the Lord may give me strength, why I so think; for the
arguments of heretics must first be discussed and refuted, which
they do not produce from the divine books, but from their own
reasons, and by which, as they think, they forcibly compel us so to
understand the testimonies of the Scriptures which treat of the
Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, as they themselves
will.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vi.xxii-p7">32. But now, as I think, it has
been sufficiently shown, that the Son is not therefore less because
He is sent by the Father, nor the Holy Spirit less because both the
Father sent Him and the Son. For these things are perceived to be
laid down in the Scriptures, either on account of the visible
creature; or rather on account of commending to our thoughts the
emanation [within the Godhead];<note place="end" n="563" id="iv.i.vi.xxii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vi.xxii-p8"> [The original is: &#8220;<i>propter

renders &#8220;On account of commending to our thoughts the principle
[of the Godhead].&#8221; The technical use of &#8220;principium&#8221; is
missed. Augustin says that the phrases, &#8220;sending the Son,&#8221; and
&#8220;sending the Spirit,&#8221; have reference to the &#8220;visible
creature&#8221; through which in the theophanies each was manifested;
but still more, to the fact that the Father is the &#8220;beginning&#8221;
of the Son, and the Father and Son are the &#8220;beginning&#8221; of the
Spirit. This fact of a &#8220;beginning,&#8221; or emanation
(<i>manatio</i>) of one from another, is what is commended to our
thoughts.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> but not on account of inequality,
or imparity, or unlikeness of substance; since, even if God the
Father had willed to appear visibly through the subject creature,
yet it would be most absurd to say that He was sent either by the
Son, whom He begot, or by the Holy Spirit, who proceeds from Him.
Let this, therefore, be the limit of the present book. Henceforth
in the rest we shall see, the Lord helping, of what sort are those
crafty arguments of the heretics, and in what manner they may be
confuted.</p>

and therefore it follows, that to beget and to be begotten, or to
be begotten and unbegotten, being diverse, are diverse substances;
whereas it is here demonstrated that not everything predicated of
God is predicated according to substance, in such manner as He is
called good and great according to substance, or anything else that
is predicated of Him in respect to Himself; but that some things
are also predicated of Him relatively, i.e. not in respect to
Himself, but to something not Himself, as He is called Father in
respect to the Son, and Lord in respect to the creature that
serveth Him; in which case, if anything thus predicated relatively,
i.e. in respect to something not Himself, is even predicated as
happening in time, as e.g. &#8220;Lord, thou hast become our refuge,&#8221;

they may perceive me to have had the desire rather than the power
to speak, what they either understand better themselves, or fail to
understand through the obscurity of my language, just as I myself
pardon them what they cannot understand through their own

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vii.i-p5">2. And we shall mutually pardon one
another the more easily, if we know, or at any rate firmly believe
and hold, that whatever is said of a nature, unchangeable,
invisible and having life absolutely and sufficient to itself, must
not be measured after the custom of things visible, and changeable,
and mortal, or not self-sufficient. But although we labor, and yet
fail, to grasp and know even those things which are within the
scope of our corporeal senses, or what we are ourselves in the
inner man; yet it is with no shamelessness that faithful piety
burns after those divine and unspeakable things which are above:
piety, I say, not inflated by the arrogance of its own power, but
inflamed by the grace of <pb n="88" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_88.html" id="iv.i.vii.i-Page_88"/>its Creator and Saviour Himself.
For with what understanding can man apprehend God, who does not yet
apprehend that very understanding itself of his own, by which he
desires to apprehend Him? And if he does already apprehend this,
let him carefully consider that there is nothing in his own nature
better than it; and let him see whether he can there see any
outlines of forms, or brightness of colors, or greatness of space,
or distance of parts, or extension of size, or any movements
through intervals of place, or any such thing at all. Certainly we
find nothing of all this in that, than which we find nothing better
in our own nature, that is, in our own intellect, by which we
apprehend wisdom according to our capacity. What, therefore, we do
not find in that which is our own best, we ought not to seek in Him
who is far better than that best of ours; that so we may understand
God, if we are able, and as much as we are able, as good without
quality, great without quantity, a creator though He lack nothing,
ruling but from no position, sustaining all things without
&#8220;having&#8221; them, in His wholeness everywhere, yet without place,
eternal without time, making things that are changeable, without
change of Himself, and without passion. Whoso thus thinks of God,
although he cannot yet find out in all ways what He is, yet piously
takes heed, as much as he is able, to think nothing of Him that He
is not.</p>

this, as their most crafty device, namely, that whatsoever is said
or understood of God, is said not according to accident, but
according to substance, and therefore, to be unbegotten belongs to
the Father according to substance, and to be begotten belongs to
the Son according to substance; but to be unbegotten and to be
begotten are different; therefore the substance of the Father and
that of the Son are different. To whom we reply, If whatever is

said, &#8220;I and the Father are one,&#8221;<note place="end" n="568" id="iv.i.vii.iii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.iii-p3"> <scripRef passage="John x. 30" id="iv.i.vii.iii-p3.2" parsed="|John|10|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.10.30">John x. 30</scripRef></p></note> is spoken according to substance.
Therefore there is one substance of the Father and the Son. Or if
this is not said according to substance, then something is said of

Always Implies Some Change in the Thing.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vii.iv-p2">5. That which is accidental
commonly implies that it can be lost by some change of the thing to
which it is an accident. For although some accidents are said to be
inseparable, which in Greek are called 
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.vii.iv-p2.1">&#7936;&#967;&#8061;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945;</span>, as the color black
is to the feather of a raven; <pb n="89" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_89.html" id="iv.i.vii.iv-Page_89"/>yet the feather loses that
color, not indeed so long as it is a feather, but because the
feather is not always. Wherefore the matter itself is changeable;
and whenever that animal or that feather ceases to be, and the
whole of that body is changed and turned into earth, it loses
certainly that color also. Although the kind of accident which is
called separable may likewise be lost, not by separation, but by
change; as, for instance, blackness is called a separable accident
to the hair of men, because hair continuing to be hair can grow
white; yet, if carefully considered, it is sufficiently apparent,
that it is not as if anything departed by separation away from the
head when it grows white, as though blackness departed thence and
went somewhere and whiteness came in its place, but that the
quality of color there is turned and changed. Therefore there is
nothing accidental in God, because there is nothing changeable or
that may be lost. But if you choose to call that also accidental,
which, although it may not be lost, yet can be decreased or
increased,&#8212;as, for instance, the life of the soul: for as long as
it is a soul, so long it lives, and because the soul is always, it
always lives; but because it lives more when it is wise, and less
when it is foolish, here, too, some change comes to pass, not such
that life is absent, as wisdom is absent to the foolish, but such
that it is less;&#8212;nothing of this kind, either, happens to God,
because He remains altogether unchangeable.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vii.v-p2">6. Wherefore nothing in Him is said
in respect to accident, since nothing is accidental to Him, and yet
all that is said is not said according to substance. For in created
and changeable things, that which is not said according to
substance, must, by necessary alternative, be said according to
accident. For all things are accidents to them, which can be either
lost or diminished, whether magnitudes or qualities; and so also is
that which is said in relation to something, as friendships,
relationships, services, likenesses, equalities, and anything else
of the kind; so also positions and conditions,<note place="end" n="570" id="iv.i.vii.v-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.v-p3"> <i>Habitus</i></p></note> places and times, acts and
passions. But in God nothing is said to be according to accident,
because in Him nothing is changeable; and yet everything that is
said, is not said, according to substance. For it is said in
relation to something, as the Father in relation to the Son and the
Son in relation to the Father, which is not accident; because both
the one is always Father, and the other is always Son: yet not
&#8220;always,&#8221; meaning from the time when the Son was born
[<i>natus</i>], so that the Father ceases not to be the Father
because the Son never <i>ceases</i> to be the Son, but because the
Son was <i>always</i> born, and never began to be the Son. But if
He had begun to be at any time, or were at any time to cease to be,
the Son, then He would be called Son according to accident. But if
the Father, in that He is called the Father, were so called in
relation to Himself, not to the Son; and the Son, in that He is
called the Son, were so called in relation to Himself, not to the
Father; then both the one would be called Father, and the other
Son, according to substance. But because the Father is not called
the Father except in that He has a Son, and the Son is not called
Son except in that He has a Father, these things are not said
according to substance; because each of them is not so called in
relation to Himself, but the terms are used reciprocally and in
relation each to the other; nor yet according to accident, because
both the being called the Father, and the being called the Son, is
eternal and unchangeable to them. Wherefore, although to be the
Father and to be the Son is different, yet their substance is not
different; because they are so called, not according to substance,
but according to relation, which relation, however, is not
accident, because it is not changeable.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vii.vi-p2">7. But if they think they can
answer this reasoning thus,&#8212;that the Father indeed is so called
in relation to the Son, and the Son in relation to the Father, but
that they are said to be unbegotten and begotten in relation to
themselves, not in relation each to the other; for that it is not
the same thing to call Him unbegotten as it is to call Him the
Father, because there would be nothing to hinder our calling Him
unbegotten even if He had not begotten the Son; and if any one
beget a son, he is not therefore himself unbegotten, for men, who
are begotten by other men, themselves also beget others; and
therefore they say the Father is called Father in relation to the
Son, and the Son is called Son in relation to the Father, but
unbegotten is said in relation to Himself, and begotten in relation
to Himself; and therefore, if whatever is said in relation to
oneself is said according to sub<pb n="90" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_90.html" id="iv.i.vii.vi-Page_90"/>stance, while to be unbegotten
and to be begotten are different, then the substance is
different:&#8212;if this is what they say, then they do not understand
that they do indeed say something that requires more careful
discussion in respect to the term unbegotten, because neither is
any one therefore a father because unbegotten, nor therefore
unbegotten because he is a father, and on that account he is
supposed to be called unbegotten, not in relation to anything else,
but in respect to himself; but, on the other hand, with a wonderful
blindness, they do not perceive that no one can be said to be
begotten except in relation to something. For he is therefore a son
because begotten; and because a son, therefore certainly begotten.
And as is the relation of son to father, so is the relation of the
begotten to the begetter; and as is the relation of father to son,
so is the relation of the begetter to the begotten. And therefore
any one is understood to be a begetter under one notion, but
understood to be unbegotten under another. For though both are said
of God the Father, yet the former is said in relation to the
begotten, that is to the Son, which, indeed, they do not deny; but
that He is called unbegotten, they declare to be said in respect to
Himself. They say then, If anything is said to be a father in
respect to itself, which cannot be said to be a son in respect to
itself, and whatever is said in respect to self is said according
to substance; and He is said to be unbegotten in respect to
Himself, which the Son cannot be said to be; therefore He is said
to be unbegotten according to substance; and because the Son cannot
be so said to be, therefore He is not of the same substance. This
subtlety is to be answered by compelling them to say themselves
according to what it is that the Son is equal to the Father;
whether according to that which is said in relation to Himself, or
according to that which is said in relation to the Father. For it
is not according to that which is said in relation to the Father,
since in relation to the Father He is said to be Son, and the
Father is not Son, but Father. Since Father and Son are not so
called in relation to each other in the same way as friends and
neighbors are; for a friend is so called relatively to his friend,
and if they love each other equally, then the same friendship is in
both; and a neighbor is so called relatively to a neighbor, and
because they are equally neighbors to each other (for each is
neighbor to the other, in the same degree as the other is neighbor
to him), there is the same neighborhood in both. But because the
Son is not so called relatively to the Son, but to the Father, it
is not according to that which is said in relation to the Father
that the Son is equal to the Father; and it remains that He is
equal according to that which is said in relation to Himself. But
whatever is said in relation to self is said according to
substance: it remains therefore that He is equal according to
substance; therefore the substance of both is the same. But when
the Father is said to be unbegotten, it is not said what He is, but
what He is not; and when a relative term is denied, it is not
denied according to substance, since the relative itself is not
affirmed according to substance.</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.vii.vii-p1.1">Chapter 7.&#8212;The Addition of a
Negative Does Not Change the Predicament.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vii.vii-p2">8. This is to be made clear by
examples. And first we must notice, that by the word begotten is
signified the same thing as is signified by the word son. For
therefore a son, because begotten, and because a son, therefore
certainly begotten. By the word unbegotten, therefore, it is
declared that he is not son. But begotten and unbegotten are both
of them terms suitably employed; whereas in Latin we can use the
word &#8220;filius,&#8221; but the custom of the language does not allow us
to speak of &#8220;infilius.&#8221; It makes no difference, however, in the
meaning if he is called &#8220;non filius;&#8221; just as it is precisely
the same thing if he is called &#8220;non genitus,&#8221; instead of
&#8220;ingenitus.&#8221; For so the terms of both neighbor and friend are
used relatively, yet we cannot speak of &#8220;invicinus&#8221; as we can
of &#8220;inimicus.&#8221; Wherefore, in speaking of this thing or that, we
must not consider what the usage of our own language either allows
or does not allow, but what clearly appears to be the meaning of
the things themselves. Let us not therefore any longer call it
unbegotten, although it can be so called in Latin; but instead of
this let us call it not begotten, which means the same. Is this
then anything else than saying that he is not a son? Now the
prefixing of that negative particle does not make that to be said
according to substance, which, without it, is said relatively; but
that only is denied, which, without it, was affirmed, as in the
other predicaments. When we say he is a man, we denote substance.
He therefore who says he is not a man, enunciates no other kind of
predicament, but only denies that. As therefore I affirm according
to substance in saying he is a man, so I deny according to
substance in saying he is not a man. And when the question is asked
how large he is? and I say he is quadrupedal, that is, four feet in
measure, <pb n="91" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_91.html" id="iv.i.vii.vii-Page_91"/>I affirm according to quantity, and he who says he is
not quadrupedal, denies according to quantity. I say he is white, I
affirm according to quality; if I say he is not white, I deny
according to quality. I say he is near, I affirm according to
relation; if I say he is not near, I deny according to relation. I
affirm according to position, when I say he lies down; I deny
according to position, when I say he does not lie down. I speak
according to condition,<note place="end" n="571" id="iv.i.vii.vii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.vii-p3"> <i>Habitus</i></p></note> when I say he is armed; I deny
according to condition, when I say he is not armed; and it comes to
the same thing as if I should say he is unarmed. I affirm according
to time, when I say he is of yesterday; I deny according to time,
when I say he is not of yesterday. And when I say he is at Rome, I
affirm according to place; and I deny according to place, when I
say he is not at Rome. I affirm according to the predicament of
action, when I say he smites; but if I say he does not smite, I
deny according to action, so as to declare that he does not so act.
And when I say he is smitten, I affirm according to the predicament
of passion; and I deny according to the same, when I say he is not
smitten. And, in a word, there is no kind of predicament according
to which we may please to affirm anything, without being proved to
deny according to the same predicament, if we prefix the negative
particle. And since this is so, if I were to affirm according to
substance, in saying son, I should deny according to substance, in
saying not son. But because I affirm relatively when I say he is a
son, for I refer to the father; therefore I deny relatively if I
say he is not a son, for I refer the same negation to the father,
in that I wish to declare that he has not a parent. But if to be
called son is precisely equivalent to the being called begotten (as
we said before), then to be called not begotten is precisely
equivalent to the being called not son. But we deny relatively when
we say he is not son, therefore we deny relatively when we say he
is not begotten. Further, what is unbegotten, unless not begotten?
We do not escape, therefore, from the relative predicament, when he
is called unbegotten. For as begotten is not said in relation to
self, but in that he is <i>of</i> a begetter; so when one is called
unbegotten, he is not so called in relation to himself, but it is
declared that he is not <i>of</i> a begetter. Both meanings,
however, turn upon the same predicament, which is called that of
relation. But that which is asserted relatively does not denote
substance, and accordingly, although begotten and unbegotten are
diverse, they do not denote a different substance; because, as son
is referred to father, and not son to not father, so it follows
inevitably that begotten must be referred to begetter, and
not-begotten to not-begetter.<note place="end" n="572" id="iv.i.vii.vii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.vii-p4"> The terms &#8220;unbegotten&#8221; and
&#8220;begotten&#8221; are interchangeable with the terms Father and Son.
This follows from the relation of a substantive to its adjective.
In whatever sense a substantive is employed, in the same sense must
the adjective formed from it be employed. Consequently, if the
first person of the Trinity may be called Father in a sense that
implies deity, he may be called Unbegotten in the same sense. And
if the second person may be called Son in a sense implying deity,
he may be called Begotten in the same sense. The Ancient church
often employed the adjective, and spoke of God the Unbegotten and
God the Begotten (Justin Martyr, <i>Apol</i>. i. 25, 53; ii. 12,
13. Clem. Alex. <i>Stromata</i> v. xii.). This phraseology sounds
strange to the Modern church, yet the latter really says the same
thing when it speaks of God the Father, and God the
Son.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note></p>

three essences, so we do not say three greatnesses, or three who
are great. For in things which are great by partaking of greatness,
to which it is one thing to <i>be</i>, and another to be <i>
great</i>, as a great house, and a great mountain, and a great
mind; in these things, I say, greatness is one thing, and that
which is great because of greatness is another, and a great house,
certainly, is not absolute greatness itself. But that is absolute
greatness by which not only a great house is great, and any great
mountain is great, but also by which every other thing whatsoever
is great, which is called great; so that greatness itself is one
thing, and those things are another which are called great from it.
And this greatness certainly is primarily great, and in a much more
excellent way than those things which are great by partaking of it.
But since God is not great with that greatness which is not
Himself, so that God, in being great, is, as it were, partaker of
that greatness;&#8212;otherwise that will be a greatness greater than
God, whereas there is nothing greater than God; therefore, He is
great with that greatness by which He Himself is that same
greatness. And, therefore, as we do not say three essences, so
neither do we say three greatnesses; for it is the same thing to
God to be, and to be great. For the same reason neither

say three greats, but one who is great; since God is not great by
partaking of greatness, but He is great by Himself being great,
because He Himself is His own greatness. Let the same be said also
of the goodness, and of the eternity, and of the omnipotence of
God, and, in short, of all the predicaments which can be predicated

relatively, since He is referred both to the Father and to the Son,
because the Holy Spirit is the Spirit both of the Father and of the
Son. But the relation is not itself apparent in that name, but it
is apparent when He is called the gift of God;<note place="end" n="585" id="iv.i.vii.xi-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.xi-p5"> <scripRef passage="Acts viii. 20" id="iv.i.vii.xi-p5.2" parsed="|Acts|8|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.8.20">Acts viii. 20</scripRef></p></note> for He is the gift of the Father

is a certain unutterable communion of the Father and the Son; and
on that account, perhaps, He is so called, because the same name is
suitable to both the Father and the Son. For He Himself is called
specially that which they are called in common; because both the
Father is a spirit and the Son a spirit, both the Father is holy
and the Son holy.<note place="end" n="588" id="iv.i.vii.xi-p7.3"><p id="iv.i.vii.xi-p8"> [The reason which Augustin here assigns, why the name
Holy Spirit is given to the third person&#8212;namely, because
spirituality is a characteristic of both the Father and Son, from
both of whom he proceeds&#8212;is not that assigned in the more
developed trinitarianism. The explanation in this latter is, that
the third person is denominated the Spirit because of the peculiar
manner in which the divine essence is <i>communicated</i> to
him&#8212;namely, by <i>spiration</i> or out-breathing: <i>spiritus
quia spiratus</i>. This is supported by the etymological
signification of <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.vii.xi-p8.1">
&#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;</span>, which is breath; and
by the symbolical action of Christ in

xx. 22</scripRef>, which suggests the eternal spiration, or out-breathing
of the third person. The third trinitarian person is no more
spiritual, in the sense of immaterial, than the first and second
persons, and if the term &#8220;Spirit&#8221; is to be taken in this the
ordinary signification, the &#8220;trinitarian relation,&#8221; or personal
peculiarity, as Augustin remarks, &#8220;is not itself apparent in this
name;&#8221; because it would mention nothing distinctive of the third
person, and not belonging to the first and second. But taken
technically to denote the spiration or out-breathing by the Father
and Son, the trinitarian peculiarity is apparent in the
name.</p>
<p id="iv.i.vii.xi-p9">And the epithet
&#8220;Holy&#8221; is similarly explained. The third person is the Holy
Spirit, not because he is any more holy than the first and second,
but because he is the <i>source</i> and <i>author</i> of holiness
in all created spirits. This is eminently and officially his work.
In this way also, the epithet &#8220;Holy&#8221;&#8212;which in its ordinary
use would specify nothing peculiar to the third person,&#8212;mentions
a characteristic that differentiates him from the Father and
Son.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> In order,
therefore, that the communion of both may be signified from a name
which is suitable to both, the Holy Spirit is called the gift of
both. And this Trinity is one God, alone, good, great, eternal,
omnipotent; itself its own unity, deity, greatness, goodness,
eternity, omnipotence.</p>

us&#8212;since we have said that the Holy Spirit is so called

not seem to answer in turn to His designation. For we cannot, as we

those things which bear relation to each other may [in name]
mutually correspond to each other. For what is more clearly spoken
relatively than the word earnest? Since it is referred to that of
which it is an earnest, and an earnest is always an earnest of

therefore, relatively, and He is also relatively said to be the
Beginning, and whatever else there may be of the kind; but He is
called the Father in relation to the Son, the Beginning in relation
to all things, which are from Him. So the Son is relatively so
called; He is called also relatively the Word and the Image. And in
all these appellations He is referred to the Father, but the Father
is called by none of them. And the Son is also called the
Beginning; for when it was said to Him, &#8220;Who art Thou?&#8221; He
replied, &#8220;Even the Beginning, who also speak to you.&#8221;<note place="end" n="590" id="iv.i.vii.xiii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.xiii-p3"> <scripRef passage="John viii. 25" id="iv.i.vii.xiii-p3.2" parsed="|John|8|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.8.25">John viii. 25</scripRef></p></note> But is He,
pray, the Beginning of the Father? For He intended to show Himself
to be the Creator when He said that He was the Beginning, as the
Father also is the beginning of the creature in that all things are
from Him. For creator, too, is spoken relatively to creature, as
master to servant. And so when we say, both that the Father is the
Beginning, and that the Son is the Beginning, we do not speak of
two beginnings of the creature; since both the Father and the Son
together is one beginning in respect to the creature, as one
Creator, as one God. But if whatever remains within itself and
produces or works anything is a beginning to that thing which it
produces or works; then we cannot deny that the Holy Spirit also is
rightly called the Beginning, since we do not separate Him from the
appellation of Creator: and it is written of Him that He works; and
assuredly, in working, He remains within Himself; for He Himself is
not changed and turned into any of the things which He works. And
see what it is that He works: &#8220;But the manifestation of the
Spirit,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is given to every man to profit withal. For
to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the
word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same
Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to
another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another
the discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to
another the interpretation of tongues: but all these worketh that
one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He
will;&#8221; certainly as God&#8212;for who can work such great things but
God?&#8212;but &#8220;it is the same God which worketh all in all.&#8221;<note place="end" n="591" id="iv.i.vii.xiii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.xiii-p4"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xii. 6-11" id="iv.i.vii.xiii-p4.2" parsed="|1Cor|12|6|12|11" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.6-1Cor.12.11">1 Cor. xii. 6&#8211;11</scripRef></p></note> For if we

whether, as the Son, by being born, has not only this, that He is
the Son, but that He is absolutely; and so also the Holy Spirit, by
being given, has not only this, that He is given, but that He is
absolutely&#8212;whether therefore He was, before He was given, but was
not yet a <i>gift</i>; or whether, for the very reason that God was
about to give Him, He was already a gift also before He was given.
But if He does not proceed unless when He is given, and assuredly
could not proceed before there was one to whom He might be given;
how, in that case, was He [absolutely] in His very substance, if He
is not unless because He is given? just as the Son, by being born,
not only has this, that He is a Son, which is said relatively, but
His very substance absolutely, so that He is. Does the Holy Spirit
proceed always, and proceed not in time, but from eternity, but
because He so proceeded that He was capable of being given, was
already a gift even before there was one to whom He might be given?
For there is a difference in meaning between a gift and a thing
that has been given. For a gift may exist even before it is given;

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.vii.xvi-p2">17. Nor let it trouble us that the
Holy Spirit, although He is co-eternal with the Father and the Son,
yet is called something which exists in time; as, for instance,
this very thing which we have called Him, a thing that has been
given. For the Spirit is a gift eternally, but a thing that has
been given in time. For if a lord also is not so called unless when
he begins to have a slave, that appellation likewise is relative
and in time to God; for the creature is not from all eternity, of
which He is the Lord. How then shall we make it good that relative
terms themselves are not accidental, since nothing happens
accidentally to God in time, because He is incapable of change, as
we have argued in the beginning of this discussion? Behold! to be
the Lord, is not eternal to God; otherwise we should be compelled
to say that the creature also is from eternity, since He would not
be a lord from all eternity unless the creature also was a servant
from all eternity. But as he cannot be a slave who has not a lord,
neither can he be a lord who has not a slave. And if there be any
one who says that God, indeed, is alone eternal, and that times
are <pb n="96" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_96.html" id="iv.i.vii.xvi-Page_96"/>not eternal on account of their variety and
changeableness, but that times nevertheless did not begin to be in
time (for there was no time before times began, and therefore it
did not happen to God in time that He should be Lord, since He was
Lord of the very times themselves, which assuredly did not begin in
time): what will he reply respecting man, who was made in time, and
of whom assuredly He was not the Lord before he was of whom He was
to be Lord? Certainly to be the Lord of man happened to God in
time. And that all dispute may seem to be taken away, certainly to
be your Lord, or mine, who have only lately begun to be, happened
to God in time. Or if this, too, seems uncertain on account of the
obscure question respecting the soul, what is to be said of His
being the Lord of the people of Israel? since, although the nature
of the soul already existed, which that people had (a matter into
which we do not now inquire), yet that people existed not as yet,
and the time is apparent when it began to exist. Lastly, that He
should be Lord of this or that tree, or of this or that corn crop,
which only lately began to be, happened in time; since, although
the matter itself already existed, yet it is one thing to be Lord
of the matter (<i>materi&#230;</i>), another to be Lord of the already
created nature (<i>natur&#230;</i>).<note place="end" n="599" id="iv.i.vii.xvi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.xvi-p3"> [&#8220;Matter&#8221; denotes the material

at one time, and at another he is lord of the chest, although
fabricated of that same wood; which he certainly was not at the
time when he was already the lord of the wood. How then shall we
make it good that nothing is said of God according to accident,
except because nothing happens to His nature by which He may be
changed, so that those things are relative accidents which happen
in connection with some change of the things of which they are
spoken. As a friend is so called relatively: for he does not begin
to be one, unless when he has begun to love; therefore some change
of will takes place, in order that he may be called a friend. And
money, when it is called a price, is spoken of relatively, and yet
it was not changed when it began to be a price; nor, again, when it
is called a pledge, or any other thing of the kind. If, therefore,
money can so often be spoken of relatively with no change of
itself, so that neither when it begins, nor when it ceases to be so
spoken of, does any change take place in that nature or form of it,
whereby it is money; how much more easily ought we to admit,
concerning that unchangeable substance of God, that something may
be so predicated relatively in respect to the creature, that
although it begin to be so predicated in time, yet nothing shall be
understood to have happened to the substance itself of God, but
only to that creature in respect to which it is predicated?

therefore, is said to be our refuge relatively, for He is referred
to us, and He then becomes our refuge when we flee to Him; pray
does anything come to pass then in His nature, which, before we
fled to Him, was not? In us therefore some change does take place;
for we were worse before we fled to Him, and we become better by
fleeing to Him: but in Him there is no change. So also He begins to
be our Father, when we are regenerated through His grace, since He
gave us power to become the sons of God.<note place="end" n="601" id="iv.i.vii.xvi-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.vii.xvi-p5"> <scripRef passage="John i. 12" id="iv.i.vii.xvi-p5.2" parsed="|John|1|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.12">John i. 12</scripRef></p></note> Our substance therefore is changed
for the better, when we become His sons; and He at the same time
begins to be our Father, but without any change of His own
substance. Therefore that which begins to be spoken of God in time,
and which was not spoken of Him before, is manifestly spoken of Him
relatively; yet not according to any accident of God, so that
anything should have happened to Him, but clearly according to some
accident of that, in respect to which God begins to be called
something relatively. When a righteous man begins to be a friend of
God, he himself is changed; but far be it from us to say, that God
loves any one in time with as it were a new love, which was not in
Him before, with whom things gone by have not passed away and
things future have been already done. Therefore He loved all His
saints before the foundation of the world, as He predestinated
them; but when they are converted and find them; then they are said
to begin to be loved by Him, that what is said may be said in that
way in which it can be comprehended by human affections. So also,
when He is said to be wroth with the unrighteous, and gentle with
the good, they are changed, not He: just as the light is
troublesome to weak eyes, pleasant to those that are strong;
namely, by their change, not its own.</p>

Wisdom. But the answer to this is deferred for a little, while the

Some</span>think themselves hindered from
admitting the equality of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, because
it is written, &#8220;Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of
God;&#8221; in that, on this ground, there does not appear to be
equality; because the Father is not Himself power and wisdom, but
the begetter of power and wisdom. And, in truth, the question is
usually asked with no common earnestness, in what way God can be
called the Father of power and wisdom. For the apostle says,
&#8220;Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.&#8221;<note place="end" n="602" id="iv.i.viii.i-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.viii.i-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 24" id="iv.i.viii.i-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|1|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.24">1 Cor. i. 24</scripRef></p></note> And hence
some on our side have reasoned in this way against the Arians, at
least against those who at first set themselves up against the
Catholic faith. For Arius himself is reported to have said, that if
He is a Son, then He was born; if He was born, there was a time
when the Son was not: not understanding that even to be born is, to
God, from all eternity; so that the Son is co-eternal with the
Father, as the brightness which is produced and is spread around by
fire is co-eval with it, and would be co-eternal, if fire were
eternal. And therefore some of the later Arians have abandoned that
opinion, and have confessed that the Son of God did not begin to be
in time. But among the arguments which those on our side used to
hold against them who said that there was a time when the Son was
not, some were wont to introduce such an argument as this: If the
Son of God is the power and wisdom of God, and God was never
without power and wisdom, then the Son is co-eternal with God the
Father; but the apostle says, &#8220;Christ the power of God, and the
wisdom of God;&#8221; and a man must be senseless to say that God at
any time had not power or wisdom; therefore there was no time when
the Son was not.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.viii.i-p4">2. Now this argument compels us to
say that God the Father is not wise, except by having the wisdom
which He begat, not by the Father in Himself being wisdom itself.
Further, if it be so, just as the Son also Himself is called God of
God, Light of Light, we must consider whether He can be called
wisdom of wisdom, if God the Father is not wisdom itself, but only
the begetter of wisdom. And if we hold this, why is He not the
begetter also of His own greatness, and of His own goodness, and of
His own eternity, and of His own omnipotence; so that He is not
Himself His own greatness, and His own goodness, and His own
eternity, and His own omnipotence; but is great with that greatness
which He begat, and good with that goodness, and eternal with that
eternity, and omnipotent with that omnipotence, which was born of
Him; just as He Himself is not His own wisdom, but is wise with
that wisdom which was born of Him? For we need not be afraid of
being compelled to say <pb n="98" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_98.html" id="iv.i.viii.i-Page_98"/>that there are many sons of God,
over and above the adoption of the creature, co-eternal with the
Father, if He be the begetter of His own greatness, and goodness,
and eternity, and omnipotence. Because it is easy to reply to this
cavil, that it does not at all follow, because many things are
named, that He should be the Father of many co-eternal <i>sons</i>;
just as it does not follow that He is the Father of two sons,
because Christ is said to be the power of God, and the wisdom of
God. For that certainly is the power which is the wisdom, and that
is the wisdom which is the power; and in like manner, therefore, of
the rest also; so that that is the greatness which is the power, or
any other of those things which either have been mentioned above,
or may hereafter be mentioned.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.viii.ii-p2">3. But if nothing is spoken of the
Father as such, except that which is spoken of Him in relation to
the Son, that is, that He is His father, or begetter, or beginning;
and if also the begetter is by consequence a beginning to that
which he begets of himself; but whatever else is spoken of Him is
so spoken as <i>with</i> the Son, or rather <i>in</i> the Son;
whether that He is great with that greatness which He begat, or
just with that justice which He begat, or good with that goodness
which He begat, or powerful with that force or power which He
begat, or wise with that wisdom which He begat: yet the Father is
not said to be greatness itself, but the begetter of greatness; but
the Son, as He is called the Son as such, is not so called <i>
with</i> the Father but in relation <i>to</i> the Father, so is not
great in and by himself, but <i>with</i> the Father, of whom He is
the greatness; and so also is called wise <i>with</i> the Father,
of whom He Himself is the wisdom; just as the Father is called wise
<i>with</i> the Son, because He is wise with that wisdom which He
begat; therefore the one is not called without the other, whatever
they are called in respect to themselves; that is, whatever they
are called that manifests their essential nature, both are so
called together;&#8212;if these things are so, then the Father is not
God without the Son, nor the Son God without the Father, but both
together are God. And that which is said, &#8220;In the beginning was
the Word,&#8221; means that the Word was in the Father. Or if &#8220;In the
beginning&#8221; is intended to mean, Before all things; then in that
which follows, &#8220;And the Word was with God,&#8221; the Son alone is
understood to be the Word, not the Father and Son together, as
though both were one Word (for He is the Word in the same way as He
is the Image, but the Father and Son are not both together the
Image, but the Son alone is the Image of the Father: just as He is
also the Son of the Father, for both together are not the Son). But
in that which is added, &#8220;And the Word was with God,&#8221; there is
much reason to understand thus: &#8220;The Word,&#8221; which is the Son
alone, &#8220;was with God,&#8221; which is not the Father alone, but God
the Father and the Son together.<note place="end" n="603" id="iv.i.viii.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.viii.ii-p3"> [The term &#8220;God,&#8221; in the
proposition, &#8220;the Word was with God,&#8221; must refer to the Father,
not to &#8220;the Father and Son together,&#8221; because the Son could not
be said to be &#8220;with&#8221; himself. St. John says that &#8220;the word
was God&#8221; (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.viii.ii-p3.1">&#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962;</span>). The

&#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962;</span> denotes the abstract
deity, or the divine nature without reference to the persons in it.
He also says that &#8220;the Word was with God&#8221; (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.viii.ii-p3.3">&#964;&#8056;&#957;
&#952;&#949;&#8056;&#957;</span>). The presence of the
article in this instance denotes one of the divine persons in the
essence: namely, the Father, with whom the Word was from eternity,
and upon whose &#8220;bosom&#8221; he was from eternity. (<scripRef passage="John i. 18" id="iv.i.viii.ii-p3.5" parsed="|John|1|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.18">John i. 18</scripRef>).&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> But what wonder is there, if this
can be said in the case of some twofold things widely different
from each other? For what are so different as soul and body? Yet we
can say the soul was with a man, that is, in a man; although the
soul is not the body, and man is both soul and body together. So
that what follows in the Scripture, &#8220;And the Word was God,&#8221;<note place="end" n="604" id="iv.i.viii.ii-p3.6"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.viii.ii-p4"> <scripRef passage="John i. 1" id="iv.i.viii.ii-p4.2" parsed="|John|1|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.1">John i. 1</scripRef></p></note> may be
understood thus: The Word, which is not the Father, was God
together with the Father. Are we then to say thus, that the Father
is the begetter of His own greatness, that is, the begetter of His
own power, or the begetter of His own wisdom; and that the Son is
greatness, and power, and wisdom; but that the great, omnipotent,
and wise God, is both together? How then God <i>of</i> God, Light
of Light? For not both together are God of God, but only the Son is
of God, that is to say, of the Father; nor are both together Light
of Light, but the Son only is of Light, that is, of the Father.
Unless, perhaps, it was in order to intimate and inculcate briefly
that the Son is co-eternal with the Father, that it is said, God of
God, and Light of Light, or anything else of the like kind: as if
to say, This which is not the Son without the Father, <i>of</i>
this which is not the Father without the Son; that is, this Light
which is not Light without the Father, <i>of</i> that Light, <i>
viz</i>. the Father, which is not Light without the Son; so that,
when it is said, God which is not the Son without the Father, and
<i>of</i> God which is not the Father without the Son, it may be
perfectly understood that the Begetter did not precede that which
He begot. And if this be so, then this alone cannot be said of
them, namely, this or that of this or that, which they are not both
together. Just as the Word cannot be said to be <i>of</i>
the <pb n="99" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_99.html" id="iv.i.viii.ii-Page_99"/>Word, because both are not the Word together, but only
the Son; nor image <i>of</i> image, since they are not both
together the image; nor Son <i>of</i> Son, since both together are

therefore, anything is so called one, that it is not added in what

meant that something is made one out of things more than one,
though they are different in nature. As soul and body are assuredly
not one; for, what are so different? unless there be added, or
understood in what they are one, that is, one man, or one animal
[person]. Thence the apostle says, &#8220;He who is joined to a harlot,

one; but he added, &#8220;spirit.&#8221; For the spirit of man and the
Spirit of God are different in nature; but by being joined they
become one spirit of two different spirits, so that the Spirit of
God is blessed and perfect without the human spirit, but the spirit
of man cannot be blessed without God. Nor is it without cause, I
think, that when the Lord said so much in the Gospel according to
John, and so often, of unity itself, whether of His own with the
Father, or of ours interchangeably with ourselves; He has nowhere
said, that we are also one with Himself, but, &#8220;that they maybe

greater? For if greater, He is greater by greatness; but whereas
the Son is His greatness, neither assuredly is the Son greater than
He who begat Him, nor is the Father greater than that greatness,
whereby He is great; therefore they are equal. For whence is He
equal, if not in that which He is, to whom it is not one thing to
be, and another to be great? Or if the Father is greater in
eternity, the Son is not equal in anything whatsoever. For whence
equal? If you say in greatness, that greatness is not equal which
is less eternal, and so of all things else. Or is He perhaps equal
in power, but not equal in wisdom? But how is that power which is
less wise, equal? Or is He equal in wisdom, but not equal in power?
But how is that wisdom equal which is less powerful? It remains,
therefore, that if He is not equal in anything, He is not equal in
all. But Scripture proclaims, that &#8220;He thought it not robbery to

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.viii.iv-p2">6. For in like manner the virtues
which are in the human mind, although each has its own several and
different meaning, yet are in no way mutually separable; so that,
for instance, whosoever were equal in courage, are equal also in
prudence, and temperance, and justice. For if you say that such and
such men are equal in courage, but that one of them is greater in
prudence, it follows that the courage of the other is less prudent,
and so neither are they equal in courage, since the courage of the
former is more prudent. And so you will find it to be the case with
the other virtues, if you consider them one by one. For the
question is not of the strength of the body, but of the courage
of <pb n="100" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_100.html" id="iv.i.viii.iv-Page_100"/>the mind. How much more therefore is this the case in
that unchangeable and eternal substance, which is incomparably more
simple than the human mind is? Since, in the human mind, to be is
not the same as to be strong, or prudent, or just, or temperate;
for a mind can exist, and yet have none of these virtues. But in
God to be is the same as to be strong, or to be just, or to be
wise, or whatever is said of that simple multiplicity, or multifold
simplicity, whereby to signify His substance. Wherefore, whether we
say God of God in such way that this name belongs to each, yet not
so that both together are two Gods, but one God; for they are in
such way united with each other, as according to the apostle&#8217;s
testimony may take place even in diverse and differing substances;
for both the Lord alone is a Spirit, and the spirit of a man alone
is assuredly a spirit; yet, if it cleave to the Lord, &#8220;it is one
spirit:&#8221; how much more there, where there is an absolutely
inseparable and eternal union, so that He may not seem absurdly to
be called as it were the Son of both, when He is called the Son of
God, if that which is called God is only said of both together. Or
perhaps it is, that whatever is said of God so as to indicate His
substance, is not said except of both together, nay of the Trinity
itself together? Whether therefore it be this or that (which needs
a closer inquiry), it is enough for the present to see from what
has been said, that the Son is in no respect equal with the Father,
if He is found to be unequal in anything which has to do with
signifying His substance, as we have already shown. But the apostle
has said that He is equal. Therefore the Son is equal with the
Father in all things, and is of one and the same
substance.</p>

are one by His gift, and one spirit with Him, because our soul
cleaves to Him so as to follow Him. And it is good for us to cleave
to God, since He will destroy every man who is estranged from
Him. Therefore
the Holy Spirit, whatever it is, is something common both to the
Father and Son. But that communion itself is consubstantial and
co-eternal; and if it may fitly be called friendship, let it be so
called; but it is more aptly called love. And this is also a
substance, since God is a substance, and &#8220;God is love,&#8221; as it
is written.<note place="end" n="614" id="iv.i.viii.v-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.viii.v-p6"> <scripRef passage="1 John iv. 16" id="iv.i.viii.v-p6.2" parsed="|1John|4|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.4.16">1 John iv. 16</scripRef></p></note> But as He is
a substance together with the Father and the Son, so that substance
is together with them great, and together with them good, and
together with them holy, and whatsoever else is said in reference
to substance; since it is not one thing to God to be, and another
to be great or to be good, and the rest, as we have shown above.
For if love is less great therein [<i>i.e.</i> in God] than wisdom,
then wisdom is loved in less degree than according to what it is;
love is therefore equal, in order that wisdom may be loved
according to its being; but wisdom is equal with the Father, as we
have proved above; therefore also the Holy Spirit is equal; and if
equal, equal in all things, on account of the absolute simplicity
which is in that substance. And therefore they are not more than
three: One who loves Him who is from Himself, and One who loves Him
from whom He is, and Love itself. And if this last is nothing, how
is &#8220;God love&#8221;? If it is not substance, how is God
substance?</p>

Substance Both Simple and Manifold.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.viii.vi-p2">8. But if it is asked how that
substance is both simple and manifold: consider, first, why the
creature is manifold, but in no way really simple. And first, all
that is body is composed certainly of parts; so that therein one
part is greater, another less, and the whole is greater than any
part whatever or how great soever. For the heaven and the earth are
parts of the whole bulk of the world; and the earth alone, and the
heaven alone, is composed of innumerable parts; and its third part
is less than the remainder, and the half of it is less than the
whole; and the whole body of the world, which is usually
<pb n="101" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_101.html" id="iv.i.viii.vi-Page_101"/>called
by its two parts, <i>viz</i>. the heaven and the earth, is
certainly greater than the heaven alone or the earth alone. And in
each several body, size is one thing, color another, shape another;
for the same color and the same shape may remain with diminished
size; and the same shape and the same size may remain with the
color changed; and the same shape not remaining, yet the thing may
be just as great, and of the same color. And whatever other things
are predicated together of body can be changed either all together,
or the larger part of them without the rest. And hence the nature
of body is conclusively proved to be manifold, and in no respect
simple. The spiritual creature also, that is, the soul, is indeed
the more simple of the two if compared with the body; but if we
omit the comparison with the body, it is manifold, and itself also
not simple. For it is on this account more simple than the body,
because it is not diffused in bulk through extension of place, but
in each body, it is both whole in the whole, and whole in each
several part of it; and, therefore, when anything takes place in
any small particle whatever of the body, such as the soul can feel,
although it does not take place in the whole body, yet the whole
soul feels it, since the whole soul is not unconscious of it. But,
nevertheless, since in the soul also it is one thing to be
skillful, another to be indolent, another to be intelligent,
another to be of retentive memory; since cupidity is one thing,
fear another, joy another, sadness another; and since things
innumerable, and in innumerable ways, are to be found in the nature
of the soul, some without others, and some more, some less; it is
manifest that its nature is not simple, but manifold. For nothing
simple is changeable, but every creature is changeable.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.viii.ix-p2">10. And since we are showing how we
can say the Father alone, because there is no Father in the Godhead
except Himself, we must consider also the opinion which holds that
the only true God is not the Father alone, but the Father and the
Son and the Holy Spirit. For if any one should ask whether the
Father alone is God, how can it be replied that He is not, unless
perhaps we were to say that the Father indeed is God, but that He
is not God alone, but that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are God
alone? But then what shall we do with that testimony of the Lord?
For He was speaking to the Father, and had named the Father as Him
to whom He was speaking, when He says, &#8220;And this is life eternal,
that they may know Thee the one true God.&#8221;<note place="end" n="619" id="iv.i.viii.ix-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.viii.ix-p3"> <scripRef passage="John xvii. 3" id="iv.i.viii.ix-p3.2" parsed="|John|17|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.17.3">John xvii. 3</scripRef></p></note> And this the Arians indeed usually
take, as if the Son were not true God. Passing them by, however, we
must see whether, when it is said to the Father, &#8220;That they may
know Thee the one true God,&#8221; we are forced to understand it as if
He wished to intimate that the Father alone is the true God; lest
we should not understand any to be God, except the three together,
the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Are we therefore, from the
testimony of the Lord, both to call the Father the one true God,
and the Son the one true God, and the Holy Spirit the one true God,
and the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit together, that is, the
Trinity itself together, not three true Gods but one true God? Or
because He added, &#8220;And Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent,&#8221; are
we to supply &#8220;the one true God;&#8221; so that the order of the words
is this, &#8220;That they may know Thee, and Jesus Christ whom Thou
hast sent, the one true God?&#8221; Why then did He omit to mention the
Holy Spirit? Is it because it follows, that whenever we name One
who cleaves to One by a harmony so great that through this harmony
both are one, this harmony itself must be understood, although it
is not mentioned? For in that place, too, the apostle seems as it
were to pass over the Holy Spirit; and yet there, too, He is
understood, where he says, &#8220;All are yours, and ye are Christ&#8217;s,

For the Father with the Son is God, but the Son alone is Christ:

with the mind is man; why is not the Word with the Father, which
together is God, much more suitably and much more the head of
Christ, although Christ as man cannot be understood except with the
Word which was made flesh? But this, as we have already said, we
shall consider somewhat more carefully hereafter. At present the
equality and one and the same substance of the Trinity has been
demonstrated as briefly as possible, that in whatever way that
other question be determined, the more rigorous discussion of which
we have deferred, nothing may hinder us from confessing the
absolute equality of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>

Each Person. The Trinity is Represented in Things that are
Made.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.viii.x-p2">11. A certain writer, when he would
briefly intimate the special attributes of each of the persons in
the Trinity, tells us that &#8220;Eternity is in the Father, form in
the Image, use in the Gift.&#8221; And since he was a man of no mean
authority in handling the Scriptures, and in the assertion of the
faith, for it is Hilary who put this in his book (<i>On the
Trinity, ii.</i>); I have searched into the hidden meaning of these
words as far as I can, that is, of the Father, and the Image, and
the Gift, of eternity, and of form, and of use. And I do not think
that he intended more by the word eter<pb n="103" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_103.html" id="iv.i.viii.x-Page_103"/>nity, than
that the Father has not a father from whom He is; but the Son is
from the Father, so as to be, and so as to be co-eternal with Him.
For if an image perfectly fills the measure of that of which it is
the image, then the image is made equal to that of which it is the
image, not the latter to its own image. And in respect to this
image he has named form, I believe on account of the quality of
beauty, where there is at once such great fitness, and prime
equality, and prime likeness, differing in nothing, and unequal in
no respect, and in no part unlike, but answering exactly to Him
whose image it is: where there is prime and absolute life, to whom
it is not one thing to live, and another to be, but the same thing
to be and to live; and prime and absolute intellect, to whom it is
not one thing to live, another to understand, but to understand is
to live, and is to be, and all things are one: as though a perfect
Word (<scripRef passage="John i. 1" id="iv.i.viii.x-p2.2" parsed="|John|1|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.1">John i. 1</scripRef>), to which
nothing is wanting, and a certain skill of the omnipotent and wise
God, full of all living, unchangeable sciences, and all one in it,
as itself is one from one, with whom it is one. Therein God knew
all things which He made by it; and therefore, while times pass
away and succeed, nothing passes away or succeeds to the knowledge
of God. For things which are created are not therefore known by
God, because they have been made; and not rather have been
therefore made, even although changeable, because they are known
unchangeably by Him. Therefore that unspeakable conjunction of the
Father and His image is not without fruition, without love, without
joy. Therefore that love, delight, felicity, or blessedness, if
indeed it can be worthily expressed by any human word, is called by
him, in short, Use; and is the Holy Spirit in the Trinity, not
begotten, but the sweetness of the begetter and of the begotten,
filling all creatures according to their capacity with abundant
bountifulness and copiousness, that they may keep their proper
order and rest satisfied in their proper place.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.viii.x-p3">12. Therefore all these things
which are made by divine skill, show in themselves a certain unity,
and form, and order; for each of them is both some one thing, as
are the several natures of bodies and dispositions of souls; and is
fashioned in some form, as are the figures or qualities of bodies,
and the various learning or skill of souls; and seeks or preserves
a certain order, as are the several weights or combinations of
bodies and the loves or delights of souls. When therefore we regard
the Creator, who is understood by the things that are made<note place="end" n="624" id="iv.i.viii.x-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.viii.x-p4"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 20" id="iv.i.viii.x-p4.2" parsed="|Rom|1|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.20">Rom. i. 20</scripRef></p></note> we must
needs understand the Trinity of whom there appear traces in the
creature, as is fitting. For in that Trinity is the supreme source
of all things, and the most perfect beauty, and the most blessed
delight. Those three, therefore, both seem to be mutually
determined to each other, and are in themselves infinite. But here
in corporeal things, one thing alone is not as much as three
together, and two are something more than one; but in that highest
Trinity one is as much as the three together, nor are two anything
more than one. And They are infinite in themselves. So both each
are in each, and all in each, and each in all, and all in all, and

which He is just, and whatever else there is? Or if all these
things are understood, although under more names than one, to be in
the same wisdom and power, so that that is greatness which is
power, that is goodness which is wisdom, and that again is wisdom
which is power, as we have already argued; then let us remember,
that when I mention any one of these, I am to be taken as if I
mentioned all. It is asked, then, whether the Father also by
Himself is wise, and is Himself His own wisdom itself; or whether
He is wise in the same way as He speaks. For He speaks by the Word
which He begat, not by the word which is uttered, and sounds, and
passes away, but by the Word which was with God, and the Word was
God, and all things were made by Him:<note place="end" n="628" id="iv.i.ix.i-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.ix.i-p4"> <scripRef passage="John i. 1, 3" id="iv.i.ix.i-p4.2" parsed="|John|1|1|0|0;|John|1|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.1 Bible:John.1.3">John i. 1, 3</scripRef></p></note> by the Word which is equal to
Himself, by whom He always and unchangeably utters Himself. For He
is not Himself the Word, as He is not the Son nor the image. But in
speaking (putting aside those words of God in time which are
produced in the creature, for they sound and pass away,&#8212;in
speaking then) by that co-eternal Word, He is not understood
singly, but with that Word itself, without whom certainly He does
not speak. Is He then in such way wise as He is one who speaks, so
as to be in such way wisdom, as He is the Word, and so that to be
the Word is to be wisdom, that is, also to be power, so that power
and wisdom and the Word may be <pb n="105" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_105.html" id="iv.i.ix.i-Page_105"/>the same, and be so called
relatively as the Son and the image: and that the Father is not
singly powerful or wise, but together with the power and wisdom
itself which He begat (<i>genuit</i>); just as He is not singly one
who speaks, but by that Word and together with that Word which He
begat; and in like way great by that and together with that
greatness, which He begat? And if He is not great by one thing, and
God by another, but great by that whereby He is God, because it is
not one thing to Him to be great and another to be God; it follows
that neither is He God singly, but by that and together with that
deity (<i>deitas</i>) which He begat; so that the Son is the deity
of the Father, as He is the wisdom and power of the Father, and as
He is the Word and image of the Father. And because it is not one
thing to Him to be, another to be God, the Son is also the essence
of the Father, as He is His Word and image. And hence also&#8212;except
that He is the Father [the Unbegotten]&#8212;the Father is not anything
unless because He has the Son; so that not only that which is meant
by Father (which it is manifest He is not called relatively to
Himself but to the Son, and therefore is the Father because He has
the Son), but that which He is in respect to His own substance is
so called, because He begat His own essence. For as He is great,
only with that greatness which He begat, so also He is, only with
that essence which He begat; because it is not one thing to Him to
be, and another to be great. Is He therefore the Father of His own
essence, in the same way as He is the Father of His own greatness,
as He is the Father of His own power and wisdom? since His
greatness is the same as His power, and His essence the same as His
greatness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ix.i-p5">2. This discussion has arisen from
that which is written, that &#8220;Christ is the power of God, and the
wisdom of God.&#8221; Wherefore our discourse is compressed into these
narrow limits, while we desire to speak things unspeakable; that
either we must say that Christ is not the power of God and the
wisdom of God, and so shamelessly and impiously resist the apostle;
or we must acknowledge that Christ is indeed the power of God and
the wisdom of God, but that His Father is not the Father of His own
power and wisdom, which is not less impious; for so neither will He
be the Father of Christ, because Christ is the power of God and the
wisdom of God; or that the Father is not powerful with His own
power, or wise with His own wisdom: and who shall dare to say this?
Or yet, again, that we must understand, that in the Father it is
one thing to be, another thing to be wise, so that He is not by
that by which He is wise: a thing usually understood of the soul,
which is at some times unwise, at others wise; as being by nature
changeable, and not absolutely and perfectly simple. Or, again,
that the Father is not anything in respect to His own substance;
and that not only that He is the Father, but that He <i>is</i>, is
said relatively to the Son. How then can the Son be of the same
essence as the Father, seeing that the Father, in respect to
Himself, is neither His own essence, nor <i>is</i> at all in
respect to Himself, but even His essence is in relation to the Son?
But, on the contrary, much more is He of one and the same essence,
since the Father and Son are one and the same essence; seeing that
the Father has His being itself not in respect to Himself, but to
the Son, which essence He begat, and by which essence He is
whatever He is. Therefore neither [person] <i>is</i> in respect to
Himself alone; and both exist relatively the one to the other. Or
is the Father alone not called Father of himself, but whatever He
is called, is called relatively to the Son, but the Son is
predicated of in reference to Himself? And if it be so, what is
predicated of Him in reference to Himself? Is it His essence
itself? But the Son is the essence of the Father, as He is the
power and wisdom of the Father, as He is the Word of the Father,
and the image of the Father. Or if the Son is called essence in
reference to Himself, but the Father is not essence, but the
begetter of the essence, and <i>is</i> not in respect to Himself,
but <i>is</i> by that very essence which He begat; as He is great
by that greatness which He begat: therefore the Son is also called
greatness in respect to Himself; therefore He is also called, in
like manner, power, and wisdom, and word, and image. But what can
be more absurd than that He should be called image in respect to
Himself? Or if image and word are not the very same with power and
wisdom, but the former are spoken relatively, and the latter in
respect to self, not to another; then we get to this, that the
Father is not wise with that wisdom which He begat, because He
Himself cannot be spoken relatively to it, and it cannot be spoken
relatively to Him. For all things which are said relatively are
said reciprocally; therefore it remains that even in essence the
Son is spoken of relatively to the Father. But from this is educed
a most unexpected sense: that essence itself is not essence, or at
least that, when it is called essence, not essence but something
relative is intimated. As when <pb n="106" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_106.html" id="iv.i.ix.i-Page_106"/>we speak of a master, essence
is not intimated, but a relative which has reference to a slave;
but when we speak of a man, or any such thing which is said in
respect to self not to something else, then essence is intimated.
Therefore when a man is called a master, man himself is essence,
but he is called master relatively; for he is called man in respect
to himself, but master in respect to his slave. But in regard to
the point from which we started, if essence itself is spoken
relatively, essence itself is not essence. Add further, that all
essence which is spoken of relatively, is also something, although
the relation be taken away; as <i>e.g.</i> in the case of a man who
is a master, and a man who is a slave, and a horse that is a beast
of burden, and money that is a pledge, the man, and the horse, and
the money are spoken in respect to themselves, and are substances
or essences; but master, and slave, and beast of burden, and
pledge, are spoken relatively to something. But if there were not a
man, that is, some substance, there would be none who could be
called relatively a master; and if there were no horse having a
certain essence, there would be nothing that could be called
relatively a beast of burden; so if money were not some kind of
substance, it could not be called relatively a pledge. Wherefore,
if the Father also is not something in respect to Himself then
there is no one at all that can be spoken of relatively to
something. For it is not as it is with color. The color of a thing
is referred to the thing colored, and color is not spoken at all in
reference to substance, but is always of something that is colored;
but that thing of which it is the color, even if it is referred to
color in respect to its being colored, is yet, in respect to its
being a body, spoken of in respect to substance. But in no way may
we think, in like manner, that the Father cannot be called anything
in respect to His own substance, but that whatever He is called, He
is called in relation to the Son; while the same Son is spoken of
both in respect to His own substance and in relation to the Father,
when He is called great greatness, and powerful power, plainly in
respect to Himself, and the greatness and power of the great and
powerful Father, by which the Father is great and powerful. It is
not so; but both are substance, and both are one substance. And as
it is absurd to say that whiteness is not white, so is it absurd to
say that wisdom is not wise; and as whiteness is called white in
respect to itself, so also wisdom is called wise in respect to
itself. But the whiteness of a body is not an essence, since the
body itself is the essence, and that is a quality of it; and hence
also a body is said from that quality to be white, to which body to
be is not the same thing as to be white. For the form in it is one
thing, and the color another; and both are not in themselves, but
in a certain bulk, which bulk is neither form nor color, but is
formed and colored. True wisdom is both wise, and wise in itself.
And since in the case of every soul that becomes wise by partaking
of wisdom, if it again becomes foolish, yet wisdom in itself
remains; nor when that soul was changed into folly is the wisdom
likewise so changed; therefore wisdom is not in him who becomes
wise by it, in the same manner as whiteness is in the body which is
by it made white. For when the body has been changed into another
color, that whiteness will not remain, but will altogether cease to
be. But if the Father who begat wisdom is also made wise by it, and
to be is not to Him the same as to be wise, then the Son is His
quality, not His offspring; and there will no longer be absolute
simplicity in the Godhead. But far be it from being so, since in
truth in the Godhead is absolutely simple essence, and therefore to
be is there the same as to be wise. But if to be is there the same
as to be wise, then the Father is not wise by that wisdom which He
begat; otherwise He did not beget it, but it begat Him. For what
else do we say when we say, that to Him to be is the same as to be
wise, unless that He is by that whereby He is wise? Wherefore, that
which is the cause to Him of being wise, is itself also the cause
to Him that He is; and accordingly, if the wisdom which He begat is
the cause to Him of being wise, it is also the cause to Him that He
is; and this cannot be the case, except either by begetting or by
creating Him. But no one ever said in any sense that wisdom is
either the begetter or the creator of the Father; for what could be
more senseless? Therefore both the Father Himself is wisdom, and
the Son is in such way called the wisdom of the Father, as He is
called the light of the Father; that is, that in the same manner as
light from light, and yet both one light, so we are to understand
wisdom of wisdom, and yet both one wisdom; and therefore also one
essence, since, in God, to be, is the same as to be wise. For what
to be wise is to wisdom, and to be able is to power, and to be
eternal is to eternity, and to be just to justice, and to be great
to greatness, that being itself is to essence. And since in the
Divine simplicity, to be wise is nothing else than to be, therefore
wisdom there is the same as essence.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ix.ii-p2">3. Therefore the Father and the Son
together are one essence, and one greatness, and one truth, and one
wisdom. But the Father and Son both together are not one Word,
because both together are not one Son. For as the Son is referred
to the Father, and is not so called in respect to Himself, so also
the Word is referred to him whose Word it is, when it is called the
Word. Since He is the Son in that He is the Word, and He is the
Word in that He is the Son. Inasmuch, therefore, as the Father and
the Son together are certainly not one Son, it follows that the
Father and the Son together are not the one Word of both. And
therefore He is not the Word in that He is wisdom; since He is not
called the Word in respect to Himself, but only relatively to Him
whose Word He is, as He is called the Son in relation to the
Father; but He is wisdom by that whereby He is essence. And
therefore, because one essence, one wisdom. But since the Word is
also wisdom, yet is not thereby the Word because He is wisdom for
He is understood to be the Word relatively, but wisdom essentially:
let us understand, that when He is called the Word, it is meant,
wisdom that is <i>born</i>, so as to be both the Son and the Image;
and that when these two words are used, namely <i>wisdom</i>
(<i>is</i>) <i>born</i>, in one of the two, namely <i>born</i>,<note place="end" n="629" id="iv.i.ix.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.ix.ii-p3"> [Augustin sometimes denominates
the Son &#8220;begotten&#8221; (<i>genitus</i>), and sometimes &#8220;born&#8221;

Father; God of God, Light of Light, Essence of
Essence.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> both Word,
and Image, and Son, are understood, and in all these names essence
is not expressed, since they are spoken relatively; but in the
other word, namely <i>wisdom</i>, since it is spoken also in
respect to substance, for wisdom is wise in itself, essence also is
expressed, and that being of His which is to be wise. Whence the
Father and Son together are one wisdom, because one essence, and
singly wisdom of wisdom, as essence of essence. And hence they are
not therefore not one essence, because the Father is not the Son,
and the Son is not the Father, or because the Father is
un-begotten, but the Son is begotten: since by these names only
their <i>relative</i> attributes are expressed. But both together
are one wisdom and one essence; in which to be, is the same as to
be wise. And both together are not the Word or the Son, since to be
is not the same as to be the Word or the Son, as we have already
sufficiently shown that these terms are spoken
relatively.</p>

by which all things are made; but created or made, as in men, when
they are converted to that Wisdom which is not created and made but

comes to be something which may be called their wisdom: even as the

wisdom, because He was made man. Is it on this account that wisdom
does not speak in these books, nor is anything spoken of it, except
to declare that it is born of God, or made by Him (although the
Father is Himself wisdom), namely, because wisdom ought to be
commended and imitated by us, by the imitation of which we are
fashioned [rightly]? For the Father speaks it, that it may be His
Word: yet not as a word producing a sound proceeds from the mouth,
or is thought before it is pronounced. For this word is completed
in certain spaces of time, but that is eternal, and speaks to us by
enlightening us, what ought to be spoken to men, both of itself and
of the Father. And therefore He says, &#8220;No man knoweth the Son,

Son, that is, by His Word. For if that word which we utter, and
which is temporal and transitory, declares both itself, and that of
which we speak, how much more the Word of God, by which all things
are made? For this Word so declares the Father as He is the Father;
because both itself so is, and is that which is the Father, in so
far as it is wisdom and essence. For in so far as it is the Word,
it is not what the Father is; because the Word is not the Father,
and Word is spoken relatively, as is also Son, which assuredly is
not the Father. And therefore Christ is the power and wisdom of
God, because He Himself, being also power and wisdom, is from the

is light, and the fountain of life with God the Father, who is

every man,&#8221; that very supreme wisdom itself who is God, of whom

Father singly is light, and the Son singly is light; and the Father
singly is God, and the Son singly is God: therefore the Father also
singly is wisdom, and the Son singly is wisdom. And as both
together are one light and one God, so both are one wisdom. But the

sanctification;&#8221;<note place="end" n="637" id="iv.i.ix.iii-p9.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.ix.iii-p10"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 30" id="iv.i.ix.iii-p10.2" parsed="|1Cor|1|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.30">1 Cor. i. 30</scripRef></p></note> because we turn ourselves to Him in

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ix.iii-p11">5. On this account, then, when
anything concerning wisdom is declared or narrated in the
Scriptures, whether as itself speaking, or where anything is spoken
of it, the Son chiefly is intimated to us. And by the example of
Him who is the image, let us also not depart from God, since we
also are the Image of God: not indeed that which is equal to Him,
since we are made so by the Father through the Son, and not born of
the Father, as that is. And we are so, because we are enlightened
with light; but that is so, because it is the light that
enlightens; and which, therefore, being without pattern, is to us a
pattern. For He does not imitate any one going before Him, in
respect to the Father, from whom He is never separable at all,
since He is the very same substance with Him from whom He is. But
we by striving imitate Him who abides, and follow Him who stands
still, and walking in Him, reach out towards Him; because He is
made for us a way in time by His humiliation, which is to us an
eternal abiding-place by His divinity. For since to pure
intellectual spirits, who have not fallen through pride, He gives
an example in the form of God and as equal with God and as God; so,
in order that He might also give Himself as an example of returning
to fallen man who on account of the uncleanness of sins and the
punishment of mortality cannot see God, &#8220;He emptied Himself;&#8221;

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p2">7. For the sake, then, of speaking
of things that cannot be uttered, that we may be able in some way
to utter what we are able in no way to utter fully, our Greek
friends have spoken of one essence, three substances; but the
Latins of one essence or substance, three persons; because, as we
have already said,<note place="end" n="646" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p3"> Bk. v. c. 28.</p></note> essence usually means nothing else
than substance in our language, that is, in Latin. And provided
that what is said is understood only in a mystery, such a way of
speaking was sufficient, in order that there might be something to
say when it was asked what the three are, which the true faith
pronounces to be three, when it both declares that the Father is
not the Son, and that the Holy Spirit, which is the gift of God, is
neither the Father nor the Son. When, then, it is asked what the
three are, or who the three are, we betake ourselves to the finding
out of some special or general name under which we may embrace
these three; and no such name occurs to the mind, because the
super-eminence of the Godhead surpasses the power of customary
speech. For God is more truly thought than He is altered, and
exists more truly than He is thought. For when we say that Jacob
was not the same as Abraham, but that Isaac was neither Abraham nor
Jacob, certainly we confess that they are three, Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob. But when it is asked what three, we reply three men,
calling them in the plural by a specific name; but if we were to
say three animals, then by a generic name; for man, as the ancients
have defined him, is a rational, mortal animal: or again, as our
Scriptures usually speak, three souls, since it is fitting to
denominate the whole from the better part, that is, to denominate
both body and soul, which is the whole man, from the soul; for so
it is said that seventy-five souls went down into Egypt with Jacob,
instead of saying so many men.<note place="end" n="647" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p4"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xlvi. 27" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p4.2" parsed="|Gen|46|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.46.27">Gen. xlvi. 27</scripRef>, and <scripRef passage="Deut. x. 22" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p4.3" parsed="|Deut|10|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.10.22">Deut. x.

is not mine, and that a third belonging to some one else is neither
mine nor yours, then we confess that there are three; and if any
one ask what three, we answer three horses by a specific name, but
three animals by a generic one. And yet again, when we say that an
ox is not a horse, but that a dog is neither an ox nor a horse, we
speak of a three; and if any one questions us what three, we do not
speak now by a specific name of three horses, or three oxen, or
three dogs, because the three are not contained under the same
species, but by a generic name, three animals; or if under a higher
genus, three substances, or three creatures, or three natures. But
whatsoever things are expressed in the plural number specifically
by one name, can also be expressed generically by one name. But all
things which are generically called by one name cannot also be
called specifically by one name. For three horses, which is a
specific name, we also call three animals; but, a horse, and an ox,
and a dog, we call only three animals or substances, which are
generic names, or anything else that can be spoken generically
concerning them; but we cannot speak of them as three horses, or
oxen, or dogs, which are specific names; for we express those
things by one name, although in the plural number, which have that
in common that is signified by the name. For Abraham, and Isaac,
and Jacob, have in common that which is man; therefore they are
called three men: a horse also, and an ox, and a dog, have in
common that which is animal; therefore they are called three
animals. So three several laurels we also call three trees; but a
laurel, and a myrtle, and an olive, we call only three trees, or
three substances, or three natures: and so three stones we call
also three bodies; but stone, and wood, and iron, we call only
three bodies, or by any other higher generic name by which they can
be called. Of the Father, therefore, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
seeing that they are three, let us ask what three they are, and
what they have in common. For the being the Father is not common to
them, so that they should be interchangeably fathers <pb n="110" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_110.html" id="iv.i.ix.iv-Page_110"/>to one
another: as friends, since they are so called relatively to each
other, can be called three friends, because they are so mutually to
each other. But this is not the case in the Trinity, since the
Father only is there father; and not Father of two, but of the Son
only. Neither are they three Sons, since the Father there is not
the Son, nor is the Holy Spirit. Neither three Holy Spirits,
because the Holy Spirit also, in that proper meaning by which He is
also called the gift of God, is neither the Father nor the Son.
What three therefore? For if three persons, then that which is
meant by person is common to them; therefore this name is either
specific or generic to them, according to the manner of speaking.
But where there is no difference of nature, there things that are
several in number are so expressed generically, that they can also
be expressed specifically. For the difference of nature causes,
that a laurel, and a myrtle, and an olive, or a horse, and an ox,
and a dog, are not called by the specific name, the former of three
laurels, or the latter of three oxen, but by the generic name, the
former of three trees, and the latter of three animals. But here,
where there is no difference of essence, it is necessary that these
three should have a specific name, which yet is not to be found.
For person is a generic name, insomuch that man also can be so
called, although there is so great a difference between man and
God.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p5">8. Further, in regard to that very
generic (<i>generalis</i>) word, if on this account we say three
persons, because that which person means is common to them
(otherwise they can in no way be so called, just as they are not
called three sons, because that which son means is not common to
them); why do we not also say three Gods? For certainly, since the
Father is a person, and the Son a person, and the Holy Spirit a
person, therefore there are three persons: since then the Father is
God, and the Son God, and the Holy Spirit God, why not three Gods?
Or else, since on account of their ineffable union these three are
together one God, why not also one person; so that we could not say
three persons, although we call each a person singly, just as we
cannot say three Gods, although we call each singly God, whether
the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit? Is it because Scripture
does not say three Gods? But neither do we find that Scripture
anywhere mentions three persons. Or is it because Scripture does
not call these three, either three persons or one person (for we
read of the person of the Lord, but not of the Lord as a person),
that therefore it was lawful through the mere necessity of speaking
and reasoning to say three persons, not because Scripture says it,
but because Scripture does not contradict it: whereas, if we were
to say three Gods, Scripture would contradict it, which says,
&#8220;Hear, O Israel; the Lord thy God is one God?&#8221;<note place="end" n="648" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p6"> <scripRef passage="Deut. vi. 4" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p6.2" parsed="|Deut|6|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.6.4">Deut. vi. 4</scripRef></p></note> Why then is
it not also lawful to say three essences; which, in like manner, as
Scripture does not say, so neither does it contradict? For if
essence is a specific (<i>specialis</i>) name common to three, why
are They not to be called three essences, as Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob are called three men, because man is the specific name common
to all men? But if essence is not a specific name, but a generic
one, since man, and cattle, and tree, and constellation, and angel,
are called essences; why are not these called three essences, as
three horses are called three animals, and three laurels are called
three trees, and three stones three bodies? Or if they are not
called three essences, but one essence, on account of the unity of
the Trinity, why is it not the case, that on account of the same
unity of the Trinity they are not to be called three substances or
three persons, but one substance and one person? For as the name of
essence is common to them, so that each singly is called essence,
so the name of either substance or person is common to them. For
that which must be understood of persons according to our usage,
this is to be understood of substances according to the Greek
usage; for they say three substances, one essence, in the same way
as we say three persons, one essence or substance.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p7">9. What therefore remains, except
that we confess that these terms sprang from the necessity of
speaking, when copious reasoning was required against the devices
or errors of the heretics? For when human weakness endeavored to
utter in speech to the senses of man what it grasps in the secret
places of the mind in proportion to its comprehension respecting
the Lord God its creator, whether by devout faith, or by any
discernment whatsoever; it feared to say three essences, lest any
difference should be understood to exist in that absolute equality.
Again, it could not say that there were not three somewhats
(<i>tria qu&#230;dam</i>), for it was because Sabellius said this that
he fell into heresy. For it must be devoutly believed, as most
certainly known from the Scriptures, and must be grasped by the
mental eye with undoubting perception, that there is both
<pb n="111" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_111.html" id="iv.i.ix.iv-Page_111"/>Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit; and that the Son is
not the same with the Father, nor the Holy Spirit the same with the
Father or the Son. It sought then what three it should call them,
and answered substances or persons; by which names it did not
intend diversity to be meant, but singleness to be denied: that not
only unity might be understood therein from the being called one
essence, but also Trinity from the being called three substances or
persons. For if it is the same thing with God to be (<i>esse</i>)
as to subsist (<i>subsistere</i>), they were not to be called three
substances, in such sense as they are not called three essences;
just as, because it is the same thing with God to be as to be wise,
as we do not say three essences, so neither three wisdoms. For so,
because it is the same thing to Him to be God as to be, it is not
right to say three essences, as it is not right to say three Gods.
But if it is one thing to God to be, another to subsist, as it is
one thing to God to be, another to be the Father or the Lord (for
that which He is, is spoken in respect to Himself, but He is called
Father in relation to the Son, and Lord in relation to the creature
which serves Him); therefore He subsists relatively, as He begets
relatively, and bears rule relatively: so then substance will be no
longer substance, because it will be relative. For as from being,
He is called essence, so from subsisting, we speak of substance.
But it is absurd that substance should be spoken relatively, for
everything subsists in respect to itself; how much more God?<note place="end" n="649" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.ix.iv-p8"> [Augustin&#8217;s meaning is, that the
term &#8220;substance&#8221; is not an adequate one whereby to denote a
trinitarian distinction, because in order to denote such a
distinction it must be employed relatively, while in itself it has
an absolute signification. In the next chapter he proceeds to show
this.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ix.v-p2">10. If, however, it is fitting that
God should be said to subsist&#8212;(For this word is rightly applied
to those things, in which as subjects those things are, which are
said to be in a subject, as color or shape in body. For body
subsists, and so is substance; but those things are in the body,
which subsists and is their subject, and they are not substances,
but are in a substance: and so, if either that color or that shape
ceases to be, it does not deprive the body of being a body, because
it is not of the being of body, that it should retain this or that
shape or color; therefore neither changeable nor simple things are
properly called substances.)&#8212;If, I say, God subsists so that He
can be properly called a substance, then there is something in Him
as it were in a subject, and He is not simple, <i>i.e.</i> such
that to Him to be is the same as is anything else that is said
concerning Him in respect to Himself; as, for instance, great,
omnipotent, good, and whatever of this kind is not unfitly said of
God. But it is an impiety to say that God subsists, and is a
subject in relation to His own goodness, and that this goodness is
not a substance or rather essence, and that God Himself is not His
own goodness, but that it is in Him as in a subject. And hence it
is clear that God is improperly called substance, in order that He
may be understood to be, by the more usual name essence, which He
is truly and properly called; so that perhaps it is right that God
alone should be called essence. For He is truly alone, because He
is unchangeable; and declared this to be His own name to His
servant Moses, when He says, &#8220;I am that I am;&#8221; and, &#8220;Thus
shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: He who is hath sent me
unto you.&#8221;<note place="end" n="650" id="iv.i.ix.v-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.ix.v-p3"> <scripRef passage="Ex. iii. 14" id="iv.i.ix.v-p3.2" parsed="|Exod|3|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.3.14">Ex. iii. 14</scripRef></p></note> However,
whether He be called essence, which He is properly called, or
substance, which He is called improperly, He is called both in
respect to Himself, not relatively to anything; whence to God to be
is the same thing as to subsist; and so the Trinity, if one
essence, is also one substance. Perhaps therefore they are more
conveniently called three persons than three
substances.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ix.vi-p2">11. But lest I should seem to favor
ourselves [the Latins], let us make this further inquiry. Although
they [the Greeks] also, if they pleased, as they call three
substances three hypostases, so might call three persons three
&#8220;prosopa,&#8221; yet they preferred that word which, perhaps, was
more in accordance with the usage of their language. For the case
is the same with the word persons also; for to God it is not one
thing to be, another to be a person, but it is absolutely the same
thing. For if to be is said in respect to Himself, but person
relatively; in this way we should say three persons, the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit; just as we speak of three friends, or three
relations, or three neighbors, in that they are so mutually, not
that each one of them is so in respect to himself. Wherefore any
one of these is the friend of the other two, <pb n="112" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_112.html" id="iv.i.ix.vi-Page_112"/>or the
relation, or the neighbor, because these names have a relative
signification. What then? Are we to call the Father the person of
the Son and of the Holy Spirit, or the Son the person of the Father
and of the Holy Spirit, or the Holy Spirit the person of the Father
and of the Son? But neither is the word person commonly so used in
any case; nor in this Trinity, when we speak of the person of the
Father, do we mean anything else than the substance of the Father.
Wherefore, as the substance of the Father is the Father Himself,
not as He is the Father, but as He is, so also the person of the
Father is not anything else than the Father Himself; for He is
called a person in respect to Himself, not in respect to the Son,
or the Holy Spirit: just as He is called in respect to Himself both
God and great, and good, and just, and anything else of the kind;
and just as to Him to be is the same as to be God, or as to be
great, or as to be good, so it is the same thing to Him to be, as
to be a person. Why, therefore, do we not call these three together
one person, as one essence and one God, but say three persons,
while we do not say three Gods or three essences; unless it be
because we wish some one word to serve for that meaning whereby the
Trinity is understood, that we might not be altogether silent, when
asked, what three, while we confessed that they are three? For if
essence is the genus, and substance or person the species, as some
think, then I must omit what I just now said, that they ought to be
called three essences, as they are called three substances or
persons; as three horses are called three horses, and the same are
called three animals, since horse is the species, animal the genus.
For in this case the species is not spoken of in the plural, and
the genus in the singular, as if we were to say that three horses
were one animal; but as they are three horses by the special name,
so they are three animals by the generic one. But if they say that
the name of substance or person does not signify species, but
something singular and individual; so that any one is not so called
a substance or person as he is called a man, for man is common to
all men, but in the same manner as he is called this or that man,
as Abraham, as Isaac, as Jacob, or anyone else who, if present,
could be pointed out with the finger: so will the same reason reach
these too. For as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, are called three
individuals, so are they called three men, and three souls. Why
then are both the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, if we are
to reason about them also according to genus and species and
individual, not so called three essences, as they are called three
substances or persons? But this, as I said, I pass over: but I do
affirm, that if essence is a genus, then a single essence has no
species; just as, because animal is a genus, a single animal has no
species. Therefore the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not three
species of one essence. But if essence is a species, as man is a
species, but those are three which we call substances or persons,
then they have the same species in common, in such way as Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob have in common the species which is called man;
not as man is subdivided into Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, so can one
man also be subdivided into several single men; for this is
altogether impossible, since one man is already a single man. Why
then is one essence subdivided into three substances or persons?
For if essence is a species, as man is, then one essence is as one
man is: or do we, as we say that any three human beings of the same
sex, of the same constitution of body, of the same mind, are one
nature,&#8212;for they are three human beings, but one nature,&#8212;so
also say in the Trinity three substances one essence, or three
persons one substance or essence? But this is somehow a parallel
case, since the ancients also who spoke Latin, before they had
these terms, which have not long come into use, that is, essence or
substance, used for them to say nature. We do not therefore use
these terms according to genus or species, but as if according to a
matter that is common and the same. Just as if three statues were
made of the same gold, we should say three statues one gold, yet
should neither call the gold genus, and the statues species; nor
the gold species, and the statues individuals. For no species goes
beyond its own individuals, so as to comprehend anything external
to them. For when I define what man is, which is a specific name,
every several man that exists is contained in the same individual
definition, neither does anything belong to it which is not a man.
But when I define gold, not statues alone, if they be gold, but
rings also, and anything else that is made of gold, will belong to
gold; and even if nothing were made of it, it would still be called
gold; since, even if there were no gold statues, there will not
therefore be no statues at all. Likewise no species goes beyond the
definition of its genus. For when I define animal, since horse is a
species of this genus, every horse is an animal; but every statue
is not gold. So, although in the case of three golden statues we
should rightly say three statues, one gold; yet we do not so say
it, as to understand gold to be the genus, and the statues to be
species. Therefore neither do we so call the Trinity <pb n="113" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_113.html" id="iv.i.ix.vi-Page_113"/>three
persons or substances, one essence and one God, as though three
somethings subsisted out of one matter [leaving a remainder, <i>i.
e.</i>]; although whatever that is, it is unfolded in these three.
For there is nothing else of that essence besides the Trinity. Yet
we say three persons of the same essence, or three persons one
essence; but we do not say three persons out of the same essence,
as though therein essence were one thing, and person another, as we
can say three statues out of the same gold; for there it is one
thing to be gold, another to be statues. And when we say three men
one nature, or three men of the same nature, they also can be
called three men out of the same nature, since out of the same
nature there can be also three other such men. But in that essence
of the Trinity, in no way can any other person whatever exist out
of the same essence. Further, in these things, one man is not as
much as three men together; and two men are something more than one
man: and in equal statues, three together amount to more of gold
than each singly, and one amounts to less of gold than two. But in
God it is not so; for the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
together is not a greater essence than the Father alone or the Son
alone; but these three substances or persons, if they must be so
called, together are equal to each singly: which the natural man
does not comprehend. For he cannot think except under the
conditions of bulk and space, either small or great, since
phantasms or as it were images of bodies flit about in his
mind.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.ix.vi-p3">12. And until he be purged from
this uncleanness, let him believe in the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit, one God, alone, great, omnipotent, good, just, merciful,
Creator of all things visible and invisible, and whatsoever can be
worthily and truly said of Him in proportion to human capacity. And
when he is told that the Father only is God, let him not separate
from Him the Son or the Holy Spirit; for together with Him He is
the only God, together with whom also He is one God; because, when
we are told that the Son also is the only God, we must needs take
it without any separation of the Father or the Holy Spirit. And let
him so say one essence, as not to think one to be either greater or
better than, or in any respect differing from, another. Yet not
that the Father Himself is both Son and Holy Spirit, or whatever
else each is singly called in relation to either of the others; as
Word, which is not said except of the Son, or Gift, which is not
said except of the Holy Spirit. And on this account also they admit

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.i-p2"><span class="c19" id="iv.i.x.i-p2.1">We</span> have
said elsewhere that those things are predicated specially in the
Trinity as belonging severally to each person, which are predicated
relatively the one to the other, as Father and Son, and the gift of
both, the Holy Spirit; for the Father is not the Trinity, nor the
Son the Trinity, nor the gift the Trinity: but what whenever each
is singly spoken of in respect to themselves, then they are not
spoken of as three in the plural number, but one, the Trinity
itself, as the Father God, the Son God, and the Holy Spirit God;
the Father good, the Son good, and the Holy Spirit good; and the
Father omnipotent, the Son omnipotent, and the Holy Spirit
omnipotent: yet neither three Gods, nor three goods, nor three
omnipotents, but one God, good, omnipotent, the Trinity itself; and
whatsoever else is said of them not relatively in respect to each
other, but individually in respect to themselves. For they are thus
spoken of according to essence, since in them to be is the same as
to be great, as to be good, as to be wise, and whatever else is
said of each person individually therein, or of the Trinity itself,
in respect to themselves. And that therefore they are called three
persons, or three substances, not in order that any difference of
essence may be understood, but that we may be able to answer by
some one word, should any one ask what three, or what three things?
And that there is so great an equality in that Trinity, that not
only the Father is not greater than the Son, as regards divinity,
but neither are the Father and Son together greater than the Holy
Spirit; nor is each individual person, whichever it be of the
three, less than the Trinity itself. This is what we have said; and
if it is handled and repeated frequently, it becomes, no doubt,
more familiarly known: yet some limit, too, must be put to the
discussion, and we must supplicate God with most devout piety, that
He will open our understanding, and take away the inclination of
disputing, in order that our minds may discern the essence of the
truth, that has neither bulk nor moveableness. Now, therefore, so
far as the Creator Himself aids us in His marvellous mercy, let us
consider these subjects, into which we will enter more deeply than
we entered into those which preceded, although they are in truth
the same; preserving the while this rule, that what has not yet
been made clear to our intellect, be nevertheless not loosened from
the firmness of our faith.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.ii-p2">2. For we say that in this Trinity
two or three persons are not anything greater than one of them;
which carnal perception does not receive, for no other reason
except because it perceives as it can the true things which are
created, but cannot discern the truth itself by which they are
created; for if it could, then the very corporeal light would in no
way be more clear than this which we have said. For in respect to
the substance of truth, since it alone truly is, nothing is
greater, unless because it more truly is.<note place="end" n="662" id="iv.i.x.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.x.ii-p3"> [In this and the following
chapter, the meaning of Augustin will be clearer, if the Latin
&#8220;<i>veritas</i>,&#8221; &#8220;<i>vera</i>,&#8221; and &#8220;<i>vere</i>,&#8221; are
rendered occasionally, by &#8220;reality,&#8221; &#8220;real,&#8221; and
&#8220;really.&#8221; He is endeavoring to prove the equality of the three
persons, by the fact that they are equally real (true), and the
degree of their reality (truth) is the same. Real being is true
being; reality is truth. In common phraseology, truth and reality
are synonymous.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> But in respect to whatsoever is
intelligible and unchangeable, no one thing is more truly than
another, since all alike are unchangeably eternal; and that which
therein is called great, is not great from any other source than
from that by which it truly is. Wherefore, where magnitude itself
is truth, whatsoever has more of magnitude must needs have more of
truth; whatsoever therefore has not more of truth, has not also
more of magnitude. Further, whatsoever has more of truth is
certainly more true, just as that is greater which has more of
magnitude; therefore in respect to the substance of truth that is
more great which is more true. But the Father and the Son together
are not more truly than the Father singly, or the Son singly. Both
together, therefore, are not anything greater than each of them
singly. And since also the Holy Spirit equally is truly, the Father
and Son together are not anything greater than He, since neither
are they more truly. The Father also and the Holy Spirit together,
since they do not surpass the Son in truth (for they are not more
truly), do not surpass Him either in magnitude. And so the Son and
the Holy Spirit together are just as great as the Father alone,
since they are as truly. So also the Trinity itself is as great as
each several person therein. For where truth itself is magnitude,
that is not more great which is not more true: since in regard to
the essence of truth, to be true is the same as to be, and to be is
the same as to be great; therefore to be great is the same as to be
true. And in regard to it, therefore, what is equally true must
needs also be equally great.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.iii-p2">3. But in respect to bodies, it may
be the case that this gold and that gold may be equally true
[real], but this may be greater than that, since magnitude is not
the same thing in this case as truth; and it is one thing for it to
be gold, another to be great. So also in the nature of the soul; a
soul is not called great in the same respect in which it is called
true. For he, too, has a true [real] soul who has not a great soul;
since the essence of body and soul is not the essence of the truth
[reality] itself; as is the Trinity, one God, alone, great, true,
truthful, the truth. Of whom if we endeavor to think, so far as He
Himself permits and grants, let us not think of any touch or
embrace in local space, as if of three bodies, or of any
compactness of conjunction, as fables tell of three-bodied Geryon;
but let whatsoever may occur to the mind, that is of such sort as
to be greater in three than in each singly, and less in one than in
two, be rejected without any doubt; for so everything corporeal is
rejected. But also in spiritual things let nothing changeable that
may have occurred to the mind be thought of God. For when we aspire
from this depth to that height, it is a step towards no small
knowledge, if, before we can know what God is, we can already know
what He is not. For certainly He is neither earth nor heaven; nor,
as it were, earth and heaven; nor any such thing as we see in the
heaven; nor any such thing as we do not see, but which perhaps is
in heaven. Neither if you were to magnify in the imagination of

The Mind Does Not Become Good Unless by Turning to God.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.iv-p2">4. Behold again, and see if thou
canst. Thou certainly dost not love anything except what is good,
since good is the earth, with the loftiness of its mountains, and
the due measure of its hills, and the level surface of its plains;
and good is an estate that is pleasant and fertile; and good is a
house that is arranged in due proportions, and is spacious and
bright; and good are animal and animate bodies; and good is air
that is temperate, and salubrious; and good is food that is
agreeable and fit for health; and good is health, without pains or
lassitude; and good is the countenance of man that is disposed in
fit proportions, and is cheerful in look, and bright in color; and
good is the mind of a friend, with the sweetness of agreement, and
with the confidence of love; and good is a righteous man; and good
are riches, since they are readily useful; and good is the heaven,
with its sun, and moon, and stars; and good are the angels, by
their holy obedience; and good is discourse that sweetly teaches
and suitably admonishes the hearer; and good is a poem that is
harmonious in its numbers and weighty in its sense. And why add yet
more and more? This thing is good and that good, but take away this
and that, and regard good itself if thou canst; so wilt thou see
God, not good by a good that is other than Himself, but the good of
all good. For in all these good things, whether those which I have
mentioned, or any else that are to be discerned or thought, we
could not say that one was better than another, when we judge
truly, unless a conception of the good itself had been impressed
upon us, such that according to it we might both approve some
things as good, and prefer one good to another. So God is to be
loved, not this and that good, but the good itself. For the good
that must be sought for the soul is not one above which it is to
fly by judging, but to which it is to cleave by loving; and what
can this be except God? Not a good mind, or a good angel, or the
good heaven, but the good good. For perhaps what I wish to say may
be more easily perceived in this way. For when, for instance, a
mind is called good, as there are two words, so from these words I
understand two things&#8212;one whereby it is mind, and another whereby
it is good. And itself had no share in making itself a mind, for
there was nothing as yet to make itself to be anything; but to make
itself to be a good mind, I see, must be brought about by the will:
not because that by which it is mind is not itself anything
good;&#8212;for how else is it already called, and most truly called,
better than the body?&#8212;but it is not yet called a good mind, for
this reason, that the action of the will still is wanted, by which
it is to become more excellent; and if it has neglected this, then
it is justly blamed, and is rightly called not a good mind. For it
then differs from the mind which does perform this; and since the
latter is praiseworthy, the former doubtless, which does not
perform, it is blameable. But when it does this of set purpose, and
becomes a good mind, it yet cannot attain to being so unless it
turn itself to something which itself is not. And to what can it
turn itself that it may become a good mind, except to the good
which it loves, and seeks, and obtains? And if it turns itself back
again from this, and becomes not good, then by the very act of
turning away from the good, unless that good remain in it from
which it turns away, it cannot again turn itself back thither if it
should wish to amend.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.iv-p3">5. Wherefore there would be no
changeable goods, unless there were the unchangeable good. Whenever
then thou art told of this good thing and that good thing, which
things can also in other respects be called not good, if thou canst
put aside those things which are good by the participation of the
good, and discern that good itself by the participation of which
they are good (for when this or that good thing is spoken of, thou
understandest together with them the good itself also): if, then, I
say thou canst remove these things, and canst discern the good in
itself, then thou wilt have discerned God. And if thou shalt cleave
to Him with love, thou shalt be forthwith blessed. But whereas
other things are not loved, except because they are good,
<pb n="118" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_118.html" id="iv.i.x.iv-Page_118"/>be
ashamed, in cleaving to them, not to love the good itself whence
they are good. That also, which is a mind, only because it is a
mind, while it is not yet also good by the turning itself to the
unchangeable good, but, as I said, is only a mind; whenever it so
pleases us, as that we prefer it even, if we understand aright, to
all corporeal light, does not please us in itself, but in that
skill by which it was made. For it is thence approved as made,
wherein it is seen to have been to be made. This is truth, and
simple good: for it is nothing else than the good itself, and for
this reason also the chief good. For no good can be diminished or
increased, except that which is good from some other good.
Therefore the mind turns itself, in order to be good, to that by
which it comes to be a mind. Therefore the will is then in harmony
with nature, so that the mind may be perfected in good, when that
good is loved by the turning of the will to it, whence that other
good also comes which is not lost by the turning away of the will
from it. For by turning itself from the chief good, the mind loses
the being a good mind; but it does not lose the being a mind. And
this, too, is a good already, and one better than the body. The
will, therefore, loses that which the will obtains. For the mind
already was, that could wish to be turned to that from which it
was: but that as yet was not, that could wish to be before it was.
And herein is our [supreme] good, when we see whether the thing
ought to be or to have been, respecting which we comprehend that it
ought to be or to have been, and when we see that the thing could
not have been unless it ought to have been, of which we also do not

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.v-p8">7. But it must needs be, that, when
by reading or hearing of them we believe in any corporeal things
which we have not seen, the mind frames for itself something under
bodily features and forms, just as it may occur to our thoughts;
which either is not true, or even if it be true, which can most
rarely happen, yet this is of no benefit to us to believe in by
faith, but it is useful for some other purpose, which is intimated
by means of it. For who is there that reads or hears what the
Apostle Paul has written, or what has been written of him, that
does not imagine to himself the countenance both of the apostle
himself, and of all those whose names are there mentioned? And
whereas, among such a multitude of men to whom these books are
known, each imagines in a different way those bodily features and
forms, it is assuredly uncertain which it is that imagines them
more nearly and more like the reality. Nor, indeed, is our faith
busied therein with the bodily countenance of those men; but only
that by the grace of God they so lived and so acted as that
Scripture witnesses: this it is which it is both useful to believe,
and which must not be despaired of, and must be sought. For even
the countenance of our Lord Himself in the flesh is variously
fancied by the diversity of countless imaginations, which yet was
one, whatever it was. Nor in our faith which we have of our
<pb n="119" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_119.html" id="iv.i.x.v-Page_119"/>Lord
Jesus Christ, is that wholesome which the mind imagines for itself,
perhaps far other than the reality, but that which we think of man
according to his kind: for we have a notion of human nature
implanted in us, as it were by rule, according to which we know
forthwith, that whatever such thing we see is a man or the form of
a man.</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.x.vi-p1.1">Chapter 5.&#8212;How the Trinity May Be Loved Though
Unknown.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.vi-p2">Our conception is framed according
to this notion, when we believe that God was made man for us, as an
example of humility, and to show the love of God towards us. For
this it is which it is good for us to believe, and to retain firmly
and unshakenly in our heart, that the humility by which God was
born of a woman, and was led to death through contumelies so great
by mortal men, is the chiefest remedy by which the swelling of our
pride may be cured, and the profound mystery by which the bond of
sin may be loosed. So also, because we know what omnipotence is, we
believe concerning the omnipotent God in the power of His miracles
and of His resurrection, and we frame conceptions respecting
actions of this kind, according to the species and genera of things
that are either ingrafted in us by nature, or gathered by
experience, that our faith may not be feigned. For neither do we
know the countenance of the Virgin Mary; from whom, untouched by a
husband, nor tainted in the birth itself, He was wonderfully born.
Neither have we seen what were the lineaments of the body of
Lazarus; nor yet Bethany; nor the sepulchre, and that stone which
He commanded to be removed when He raised Him from the dead; nor
the new tomb cut out in the rock, whence He Himself arose; nor the
Mount of Olives, from whence He ascended into heaven. And, in
short, whoever of us have not seen these things, know not whether
they are as we conceive them to be, nay judge them more probably
not to be so. For when the aspect either of a place, or a man, or
of any other body, which we happened to imagine before we saw it,
turns out to be the same when it occurs to our sight as it was when
it occurred to our mind, we are moved with no little wonder. So
scarcely and hardly ever does it happen. And yet we believe those
things most steadfastly, because we imagine them according to a
special and general notion, of which we are certain. For we believe
our Lord Jesus Christ to be born of a virgin who was called Mary.
But what a virgin is, or what it is to be born, and what is a
proper name, we do not believe, but certainly know. And whether
that was the countenance of Mary which occurred to the mind in
speaking of those things or recollecting them, we neither know at
all, nor believe. It is allowable, then, in this case to say
without violation of the faith, perhaps she had such or such a
countenance, perhaps she had not: but no one could say without
violation of the Christian faith, that perhaps Christ was born of a
virgin.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.vi-p3">8. Wherefore, since we desire to
understand the eternity, and equality, and unity of the Trinity, as
much as is permitted us, but ought to believe before we understand;
and since we must watch carefully, that our faith be not feigned;
since we must have the fruition of the same Trinity, that we may
live blessedly; but if we have believed anything false of it, our
hope would be worthless, and our charity not pure: how then can we
love, by believing, that Trinity which we do not know? Is it
according to the special or general notion, according to which we
love the Apostle Paul? In whose case, even if he was not of that
countenance which occurs to us when we think of him (and this we do
not know at all), yet we know what a man is. For not to go far
away, this <i>we</i> are; and it is manifest he, too, was this, and
that his soul joined to his body lived after the manner of mortals.
Therefore we believe this of him, which we find in ourselves,
according to the species or genus under which all human nature
alike is comprised. What then do we know, whether specially or
generally, of that most excellent Trinity, as if there were many
such trinities, some of which we had learned by experience, so that
we may believe that Trinity, too, to have been such as they,
through the rule of similitude, impressed upon us, whether a
special or a general notion; and thus love also that thing which we
believe and do not yet know, from the parity of the thing which we
do know? But this certainly is not so. Or is it that, as we love in
our Lord Jesus Christ, that He rose from the dead, although we
never saw any one rise from thence, so we can believe in and love
the Trinity which we do not see, and the like of which we never
have seen? But we certainly know what it is to die, and what it is
to live; because we both live, and from time to time have seen and
experienced both dead and dying persons. And what else is it to
rise again, except to live again, that is, to return to life from
death? When, therefore, we say and believe that there is a Trinity,
we know what a Trinity is, because we know what three are; but this
is not what we love. For we can easily have this whenever we will,
to pass over other things, by just hold<pb n="120" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_120.html" id="iv.i.x.vi-Page_120"/>ing up three
fingers. Or do we indeed love, not every trinity, but <i>the</i>
Trinity, that is God? We love then in the Trinity, that it is God:
but we never saw or knew any other God, because God is One; He
alone whom we have not yet seen, and whom we love by believing. But
the question is, from what likeness or comparison of known things
can we believe, in order that we may love God, whom we do not yet
know?</p>

<div4 type="Chapter" title="How the Man Not Yet Righteous Can Know the Righteous Man Whom He Loves." n="6" shorttitle="Chapter 6" progress="22.17%" prev="iv.i.x.vi" next="iv.i.x.viii" id="iv.i.x.vii"><p class="c39" id="iv.i.x.vii-p1">

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.x.vii-p1.1">Chapter 6.&#8212;How the
Man Not Yet Righteous Can Know the Righteous Man Whom He
Loves.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.vii-p2">9. Return then with me, and let us
consider why we love the apostle. Is it at all on account of his
human kind, which we know right well, in that we believe him to
have been a man? Assuredly not; for if it were so, he now is not
him whom we love, since he is no longer that man, for his soul is
separated from his body. But we believe that which we love in him
to be still living, for we love his righteous mind. From what
general or special rule then, except that we know both what a mind
is, and what it is to be righteous? And we say, indeed, not
unfitly, that we therefore know what a mind is, because we too have
a mind. For neither did we ever see it with our eyes, and gather a
special or general notion from the resemblance of more minds than
one, which we had seen; but rather, as I have said before, because
we too have it. For what is known so intimately, and so perceives
itself to be itself, as that by which also all other things are
perceived, that is, the mind itself? For we recognize the movements
of bodies also, by which we perceive that others live besides
ourselves, from the resemblance of ourselves; since we also so move
our body in living as we observe those bodies to be moved. For even
when a living body is moved, there is no way opened to our eyes to
see the mind, a thing which cannot be seen by the eyes; but we
perceive something to be contained in that bulk, such as is
contained in ourselves, so as to move in like manner our own bulk,
which is the life and the soul. Neither is this, as it were, the
property of human foresight and reason, since brute animals also
perceive that not only they themselves live, but also other brute
animals interchangeably, and the one the other, and that we
ourselves do so. Neither do they see our souls, save from the
movements of the body, and that immediately and most easily by some
natural agreement. Therefore we both know the mind of any one from
our own, and believe also from our own of him whom we do not know.
For not only do we perceive that there is a mind, but we can also
know what a mind is, by reflecting upon our own: for we have a
mind. But whence do we know what a righteous man is? For we said
above that we love the apostle for no other reason except that he
is a righteous mind. We know, then, what a righteous man also is,
just as we know what a mind is. But what a mind is, as has been
said, we know from ourselves, for there is a mind in us. But whence
do we know what a righteous man is, if we are not righteous? But if
no one but he who is righteous knows what is a righteous man, no
one but a righteous man loves a righteous man; for one cannot love
him whom one believes to be righteous, for this very reason that
one does believe him to be righteous, if one does not know what it
is to be righteous; according to that which we have shown above,
that no one loves what he believes and does not see, except by some
rule of a general or special notion. And if for this reason no one
but a righteous man loves a righteous man, how will any one wish to
be a righteous man who is not yet so? For no one wishes to be that
which he does not love. But, certainly, that he who is not
righteous may be so, it is necessary that he should wish to be
righteous; and in order that he may wish to be righteous, he loves
the righteous man. Therefore, even he who is not yet righteous,
loves the righteous man.<note place="end" n="673" id="iv.i.x.vii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.x.vii-p3"> [The &#8220;wish&#8221; and &#8220;love&#8221;
which Augustin here attributes to the non-righteous man is not true
and spiritual, but selfish. In chapter vii. 10, he speaks of true
love as distinct from that kind of desire which is a mere wish. The
latter he calls <i>cupiditas</i>. &#8220;That is to be called love
which is true, otherwise it is desire (<i>cupiditas</i>); and so
those who desire (<i>cupidi</i>) are improperly said to love
(<i>diligere</i>), just as they who love (<i>diligunt</i>) are said
improperly to desire (<i>cupere</i>).&#8221;&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> But he cannot love the righteous
man, who is ignorant what a righteous man is. Accordingly, even he
who is not yet righteous, knows what a righteous man is. Whence
then does he know this? Does he see it with his eyes? Is any
corporeal thing righteous, as it is white, or black, or square, or
round? Who could say this? Yet with one&#8217;s eyes one has seen
nothing except corporeal things. But there is nothing righteous in
a man except the mind; and when a man is called a righteous man, he
is called so from the mind, not from the body. For righteousness is
in some sort the beauty of the mind, by which men are beautiful;
very many too who are misshapen and deformed in body. And as the
mind is not seen with the eyes, so neither is its beauty. From
whence then does he who is not yet righteous know what a righteous
man is, and love the righteous man that he may become righteous? Do
certain signs shine forth by the motion of the body, by
<pb n="121" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_121.html" id="iv.i.x.vii-Page_121"/>which
this or that man is manifested to be righteous? But whence does any
one know that these are the signs of a righteous mind when he is
wholly ignorant what it is to be righteous? Therefore he does know.
But whence do we know what it is to be righteous, even when we are
not yet righteous? If we know from without ourselves, we know it by
some bodily thing. But this is not a thing of the body. Therefore
we know in ourselves what it is to be righteous. For I find this
nowhere else when I seek to utter it, except within myself; and if
I ask another what it is to be righteous, he seeks within himself
what to answer; and whosoever hence can answer truly, he has found
within himself what to answer. And when indeed I wish to speak of
Carthage, I seek within myself what to speak, and I find within
myself a notion or image of Carthage; but I have received this
through the body, that is, through the perception of the body,
since I have been present in that city in the body, and I saw and
perceived it, and retained it in my memory, that I might find
within myself a word concerning it, whenever I might wish to speak
of it. For its word is the image itself of it in my memory, not
that sound of two syllables when Carthage is named, or even when
that name itself is thought of silently from time to time, but that
which I discern in my mind, when I utter that dissyllable with my
voice, or even before I utter it. So also, when I wish to speak of
Alexandria, which I never saw, an image of it is present with me.
For whereas I had heard from many and had believed that city to be
great, in such way as it could be told me, I formed an image of it
in my mind as I was able; and this is with me its word when I wish
to speak of it, before I utter with my voice the five syllables
which make the name that almost every one knows. And yet if I could
bring forth that image from my mind to the eyes of men who know
Alexandria, certainly all either would say, It is not it; or if
they said, It is, I should greatly wonder; and as I gazed at it in
my mind, that is, at the image which was as it were its picture, I
should yet not know it to be it, but should believe those who
retained an image they had seen. But I do not so ask what it is to
be righteous, nor do I so find it, nor do I so gaze upon it, when I
utter it; neither am I so approved when I am heard, nor do I so
approve when I hear; as though I have seen such a thing with my
eyes, or learned it by some perception of the body, or heard it
from those who had so learned it. For when I say, and say
knowingly, that mind is righteous which knowingly and of purpose
assigns to every one his due in life and behavior, I do not think
of anything absent, as Carthage, or imagine it as I am able, as
Alexandria, whether it be so or not; but I discern something
present, and I discern it within myself, though I myself am not
that which I discern; and many if they hear will approve it. And
whoever hears me and knowingly approves, he too discerns this same
thing within himself, even though he himself be not what he
discerns. But when a righteous man says this, he discerns
and <pb n="122" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_122.html" id="iv.i.x.vii-Page_122"/>says that which he himself is. And whence also does he
discern it, except within himself? But this is not to be wondered
at; for whence should he discern himself except within himself? The
wonderful thing is, that the mind should see within itself that
which it has seen nowhere else, and should see truly, and should
see the very true righteous mind, and should itself be a mind, and
yet not a righteous mind, which nevertheless it sees within itself.
Is there another mind that is righteous in a mind that is not yet
righteous? Or if there is not, what does it there see when it sees
and says what is a righteous mind, nor sees it anywhere else but in
itself, when itself is not a righteous mind? Is that which it sees
an inner truth present to the mind which has power to behold it?
Yet all have not that power; and they who have power to behold it,
are not all also that which they behold, that is, they are not also
righteous minds themselves, just as they are able to see and to say
what is a righteous mind. And whence will they be able to be so,
except by cleaving to that very same form itself which they behold,
so that from thence they may be formed and may be righteous minds;
not only discerning and saying that the mind is righteous which
knowingly and of purpose assigns to every one that which is his due
in life and behavior, but so likewise that they themselves may live
righteously and be righteous in character, by assigning to every
one that which is his due, so as to owe no man anything, but to
love one another.<note place="end" n="674" id="iv.i.x.vii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.x.vii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Rom. xiii. 8" id="iv.i.x.vii-p4.2" parsed="|Rom|13|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.13.8">Rom. xiii. 8</scripRef></p></note> And whence
can any one cleave to that form but by loving it? Why then do we
love another whom we believe to be righteous, and do not love that
form itself wherein we see what is a righteous mind, that we also
may be able to be righteous? Is it that unless we loved that also,
we should not love him at all, whom through it we love; but whilst
we are not righteous, we love that form too little to allow of our
being able to be righteous? The man therefore who is believed to be
righteous, is loved through that form and truth which he who loves
discerns and understands within himself; but that very form and
truth itself cannot be loved from any other source than itself. For
we do not find any other such thing besides itself, so that by
believing we might love it when it is unknown, in that we here
already know another such thing. For whatsoever of such a kind one
may have seen, is itself; and there is not any other such thing,
since itself alone is such as itself is. He therefore who loves
men, ought to love them either because they are righteous, or that
they may become righteous. For so also he ought to love himself,
either because he is righteous, or that he may become righteous;
for in this way he loves his neighbor as himself without any risk.
For he who loves himself otherwise, loves himself wrongfully, since
he loves himself to this end that he may be unrighteous; therefore
to this end that he may be wicked; and hence it follows next that
he does not love himself; for, &#8220;He who loveth iniquity,<note place="end" n="675" id="iv.i.x.vii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.x.vii-p5"> Violence&#8212;A.V.</p></note> hateth his

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.viii-p11">11. Wherefore they who seek God
through those Powers which rule over the world, or parts of the
world, are removed and cast away far from Him; not by intervals of
space, but by difference of affections: for they endeavor to find a
path outwardly, and forsake their own inward things, within which
is God. Therefore, even although they may either have heard some
holy heavenly Power, or in some way or another may have thought of
it, yet they rather covet its deeds at which human weakness
marvels, but do not imitate the piety by which divine rest is
acquired. For they prefer, through pride, to be able to do that
which an angel does, more than, through devotion, to be that which
an angel is. For no holy being rejoices in his own power, but in
His from whom he has the power which he fitly can have; and he
knows it to be more a mark of power to be united to the Omnipotent
by a pious will, than to be able, by his own power and will, to do
what they may tremble at who are not able to do such things.
Therefore the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, in doing such things, in
order that He might teach better things to those who marvelled at
them, and might turn those who were intent and in doubt about
unusual temporal things to eternal and inner things, says, &#8220;Come
unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest. Take my yoke upon you.&#8221; And He does not say, Learn of me,
because I raise those <pb n="123" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_123.html" id="iv.i.x.viii-Page_123"/>who have been dead four days;
but He says, &#8220;Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart.&#8221;
For humility, which is most solid, is more powerful and safer than
pride, that is most inflated. And so He goes on to say, &#8220;And ye

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.ix-p2">12. Let no one say, I do not know
what I love. Let him love his brother, and he will love the same
love. For he knows the love with which he loves, more than the
brother whom he loves. So now he can know God more than he knows
his brother: clearly known more, because more present; known more,
because more within him; known more, because more certain. Embrace
the love of God, and by love embrace God. That is love itself,
which associates together all good angels and all the servants of
God by the bond of sanctity, and joins together us and them
mutually with ourselves, and joins us subordinately to Himself. In
proportion, therefore, as we are healed from the swelling of pride,
in such proportion are we more filled with love; and with what is
he full, who is full of love, except with God? Well, but you will
say, I see love, and, as far as I am able, I gaze upon it with my
mind, and I believe the Scripture, saying, that &#8220;God is love; and
he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God;&#8221;<note place="end" n="691" id="iv.i.x.ix-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.x.ix-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 John iv. 16" id="iv.i.x.ix-p3.2" parsed="|1John|4|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.4.16">1 John iv. 16</scripRef></p></note> but when I see love, I do not see
in it the Trinity. Nay, but thou dost see the Trinity if thou seest
love. But if I can I will put you in mind, that thou mayest see
that thou seest it; only let itself be present, that we may be
moved by love to something good. Since, when we love love, we love
one who loves something, and that on account of this very thing,
that he does love something; therefore what does love love, that
love itself also may be loved? For that is not love which loves
nothing. But if it loves itself it must love something, that it may
love itself as love. For as a word indicates something, and
indicates also itself, but does not indicate itself to be a word,
unless it indicates that it does indicate something; so love also
loves indeed itself, but except it love itself as loving something,
it loves itself not as love. What therefore does love love, except
that which we love with love? But this, to begin from that which is
nearest to us, is our brother. And listen how greatly the Apostle
John commends brotherly love: &#8220;He that loveth his brother abideth
in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.&#8221;<note place="end" n="692" id="iv.i.x.ix-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.x.ix-p4"> <scripRef passage="1 John ii. 10" id="iv.i.x.ix-p4.2" parsed="|1John|2|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.2.10">1 John ii. 10</scripRef></p></note> It is
manifest that he placed the perfection of righteousness in the love
of our brother; for he certainly is perfect in whom &#8220;there is no
occasion of stumbling.&#8221; And yet he seems to have passed by the
love of God in silence; which he never would have done, unless
because he intends God to be understood in brotherly love itself.
For in this same epistle, a little further on, he says most plainly
thus: &#8220;Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and
every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that
loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.&#8221; And this passage
declares sufficiently and plainly, that this same brotherly love
itself (for that is brotherly love by which we love each other) is
set forth by so great authority, not only to be from God, but also
to be God. When, therefore, we love our brother from love, we love
our brother from God; neither can it be that we do not love above
all else that same love by which we love our brother: whence it may
be gathered that these two commandments cannot exist unless
interchangeably. For since &#8220;God is love,&#8221; he who loves love
certainly loves God; but he must needs love love, who loves his
brother. And so a little after he says, &#8220;For he that loveth not
his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not
seen&#8221;?<note place="end" n="693" id="iv.i.x.ix-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.x.ix-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 John iv. 7, 8, 20" id="iv.i.x.ix-p5.2" parsed="|1John|4|7|4|8;|1John|4|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.4.7-1John.4.8 Bible:1John.4.20">1 John iv. 7, 8,
20</scripRef></p></note> because the
reason that he does not see God is, that he does not love his
brother. For he who does not love his brother, abideth not in love;
and he who abideth not in love, abideth not in God, because God is
love. Further, he who abideth not in God, abideth not in light; for
&#8220;God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.&#8221;<note place="end" n="694" id="iv.i.x.ix-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.x.ix-p6"> <scripRef passage="1 John i. 5" id="iv.i.x.ix-p6.2" parsed="|1John|1|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.1.5">1 John i. 5</scripRef></p></note> He therefore
who abideth not in light, what wonder is it if he does not see
light, that is, does not see God, because he is in darkness? But he
sees his brother with human sight, with which God cannot be seen.
But if he loved with spiritual love him whom he sees with human
sight, he would see God, who is love itself, with the inner sight
by which He can be seen. Therefore he who does not love his brother
whom <pb n="124" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_124.html" id="iv.i.x.ix-Page_124"/>he sees, how can he love God, whom on that account he
does not see, because God is love, which he has not who does not
love his brother? Neither let that further question disturb us, how
much of love we ought to spend upon our brother, and how much upon
God: incomparably more upon God than upon ourselves, but upon our
brother as much as upon ourselves; and we love ourselves so much
the more, the more we love God. Therefore we love God and our
neighbor from one and the same love; but we love God for the sake
of God, and ourselves and our neighbors for the sake of
God.</p>

left, by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report: as
deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying,
and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful,

love of the Apostle Paul, when we read these things, unless that we
believe him so to have lived? But we do not believe that the
ministers of God ought so to live because we have heard it from any
one, but because we behold it inwardly within ourselves, or rather
above ourselves, in the truth itself. Him, therefore, whom we
believe to have so lived, we love for that which we see. And except
we loved above all else that form which we discern as always
steadfast and unchangeable, we should not for that reason love him,
because we hold fast in our belief that his life, when he was
living in the flesh, was adapted to, and in harmony with, this
form. But somehow we are stirred up the more to the love of this
form itself, through the belief by which we believe some one to
have so lived; and to the hope by which we no more at all despair,
that we, too, are able so to live; we who are men, from this fact
itself, that some men have so lived, so that we both desire this
more ardently, and pray for it more confidently. So both the love
of that form, according to which they are believed to have lived,
makes the life of these men themselves to be loved by us; and their
life thus believed stirs up a more burning love towards that same
form; so that the more ardently we love God, the more certainly and
the more calmly do we see Him, because we behold in God the
unchangeable form of righteousness, according to which we judge
that man ought to live. Therefore faith avails to the knowledge and
to the love of God, not as though of one altogether unknown, or
altogether not loved; but so that thereby He may be known more
clearly, and loved more steadfastly.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.x.xi-p2">14. But what is love or charity,
which divine Scripture so greatly praises and proclaims, except the
love of good? But love is <i>of</i> some one that loves, and <i>
with</i> love something <i>is</i> loved. Behold, then, there are
three things: he that loves, and that which is loved, and love.
What, then, is love, except a certain life which couples or seeks
to couple together some two things, namely, him that loves, and
that which is loved? And this is so even in outward and carnal
loves. But that we may drink in something more pure and clear, let
us tread down the flesh and ascend to the mind. What does the mind
love in a friend except the mind? There, then, also are three
things: he that loves, and that which is loved, and love. It
remains to ascend also from hence, and to seek those things which
are above, as far as is given to man. But here for a little while
let our purpose rest, not that it may think itself to have found
already what it seeks; but just as usually the place has first to
be found where anything is to be sought, while the thing itself is
not yet found, but we have only found already where to look for it;
so let it suffice to have said thus much, that we may have, as it

most excellent which if He is not, either the Father is love, or
the Son, or the Trinity itself; since we cannot withstand the most

Which are Found in Love Must Be Considered.<note place="end" n="705" id="iv.i.xi.ii-p1.2"><p id="iv.i.xi.ii-p2"> [Augustin here begins his discussion of some ternaries
that are found in the Finite, that illustrate the trinality of the
Infinite. Like all finite analogies, they fail at certain points.
In the case chosen&#8212;namely, the lover, the loved, and love&#8212;the
first two are substances, the last is not. The mind is a substance,
but its activity in loving is not. In chapter iv. 5, Augustin
asserts that &#8220;love and knowledge exist substantially, as the mind
itself does.&#8221; But no psychology, ancient or modern, has ever
maintained that the agencies of a spiritual entity or substance are
themselves spiritual entity or substances. The activities of the
human mind in cognizing, loving, etc., are only its energizing, not
its substance.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.ii-p3">The ambiguity of the Latin
contributes to this error. The mind and its loving, and also the
mind and its cognizing, are denominated &#8220;<i>duo qu&#230;dam</i>&#8221;
the mind, love, and knowledge, are denominated &#8220;<i>tria
qu&#230;dem</i>.&#8221; By bringing the mind and its love and knowledge
under the one term &#8220;<i>qu&#230;dam</i>,&#8221; and then giving the
meaning of &#8220;substance&#8221; to &#8220;thing,&#8221; in &#8220;something,&#8221; the
result follows that all three are alike and equally
&#8220;substantial.&#8221;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.ii-p4">This analogy taken from the mind
and its activities illustrates the trinality of the Divine essence,
but fails to illustrate the substantiality of the three persons.
The three Divine persons are not the Divine essence together with
two of its activities (such, <i>e.g</i>., as creation and
redemption), but the essence in three modes, or &#8220;forms,&#8221; as St.
Paul denominates them in <scripRef passage="Phil. iii. 6" id="iv.i.xi.ii-p4.2" parsed="|Phil|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.3.6">Phil. iii.
6</scripRef></p>

<p class="MsoEndnoteText" id="iv.i.xi.ii-p5">If Augustin could
prove his assertion that the activities of the human spirit in
knowing and loving are strictly &#8220;substantial,&#8221; then this
ternary would illustrate not only the trinality of the essence, but
the essentiality and objectivity of the persons. The fact which he
mentions, that knowledge and love are <i>inseparable</i> from the
knowing and loving mind, does not prove their equal substantiality
with the mind.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note></span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.ii-p6">2. And this being so, let us direct
our attention to those three things which we fancy we have found.
We are not yet speaking of heavenly things, nor yet of God the
Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit, but of that inadequate image,
which yet is an image, that is, man; for our feeble mind perhaps
can gaze upon this more familiarly and more easily. Well then, when
I, who make this inquiry, love anything, there are three things
concerned&#8212;myself, and that which I love, and love itself. For I
do not love love, except I love a lover; for there is no love where
nothing is loved. Therefore there are three things&#8212;he who loves,
and that which is loved, and love. But what if I love none except
myself? Will there not then be two things&#8212;that which I love, and
love? For he who loves and that which is loved are the same when
any one loves himself; just as to love and to be loved, in the same
way, is the very same thing when any one loves himself. Since the
same thing is said, when it is said, he loves himself, and he is
loved by himself. For in that case to love and to be loved are not
two different things: just as he who loves and he who is loved are
not two different persons. But yet, even so, love and what is loved
are still two things. For there is no love when any one loves
himself, except when love itself is loved. But it is one thing to
love one&#8217;s self, another to love one&#8217;s own love. For love is
not loved, unless as already loving something; since where nothing
is loved there is no love. Therefore there are two things when any
one loves himself&#8212;love, and that which is loved. For then he that
loves and that which is loved are one. Whence it seems that it does
not follow that three things are to be understood wherever love is.
For let us put aside from the inquiry all the other many things of
which a man consists; and in order that we may discover clearly
what we are now seeking, as far as in such a subject is possible,
let us treat of the mind alone. The mind, then, when it loves
itself, discloses two things&#8212;mind and love. But what is to love
one&#8217;s self, except to wish to help one&#8217;s self to the enjoyment
of self? And when any one wishes himself to be just as much as he
is, then the will is on a par with the mind, and the love is equal
to him who loves. And if love is a substance, it is certainly not
body, but spirit; and the mind also is not body, but spirit. Yet
love and mind are not two spirits, but one spirit; nor yet two
essences, but one: and yet here are two things that are one, he
that loves and love; or, if you like so to put it, that which is
loved and love. And these two, indeed, are mutually said
relatively. Since he who loves is referred to love, and love to him
who loves. For he who loves, loves with some love, and love is the
love of some one who loves. But mind and spirit are not said
relatively, but express essence. For mind and spirit do not exist
because the mind and spirit of some particular man exists. For if
we subtract the body from that which is man, which is so called
with the conjunction of body, the mind and spirit remain. But if we
subtract him that loves, then there is no love; and if we subtract
love, then there is no one that loves. And therefore, in so far as
they are mutually referred to one another, they are two; but
whereas they are spoken in re<pb n="127" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_127.html" id="iv.i.xi.ii-Page_127"/>spect to themselves, each are
spirit, and both together also are one spirit; and each are mind,
and both together one mind. Where, then, is the trinity? Let us
attend as much as we can, and let us invoke the everlasting light,
that He may illuminate our darkness, and that we may see in
ourselves, as much as we are permitted, the image of
God.</p>

Trinity in the Mind of Man Who Knows Himself and Loves Himself. The
Mind Knows Itself Through Itself.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.iii-p2">3. For the mind cannot love itself,
except also it know itself; for how can it love what it does not
know? Or if any body says that the mind, from either general or
special knowledge, believes itself of such a character as it has by
experience found others to be and therefore loves itself, he speaks
most foolishly. For whence does a mind know another mind, if it
does not know itself? For the mind does not know other minds and
not know itself, as the eye of the body sees other eyes and does
not see itself; for we see bodies through the eyes of the body,
because, unless we are looking into a mirror, we cannot refract and
reflect the rays into themselves which shine forth through those
eyes, and touch whatever we discern,&#8212;a subject, indeed, which is
treated of most subtlely and obscurely, until it be clearly
demonstrated whether the fact be so, or whether it be not. But
whatever is the nature of the power by which we discern through the
eyes, certainly, whether it be rays or anything else, we cannot
discern with the eyes that power itself; but we inquire into it
with the mind, and if possible, understand even this with the mind.
As the mind, then, itself gathers the knowledge of corporeal things
through the senses of the body, so of incorporeal things through
itself. Therefore it knows itself also through itself, since it is
incorporeal; for if it does not know itself, it does not love
itself.</p>

<div4 type="Chapter" title="The Three are One, and Also Equal, Viz. The Mind Itself, and the Love, and the Knowledge of It. That the Same Three Exist Substantially, and are Predicated Relatively.

That the Same Three are Not Joined and Commingled Like Parts, But
that They are of One Essence, and are Relatives.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.iv-p2">4. But as there are two things
(<i>duo qu&#230;dam</i>), the mind and the love of it, when it loves
itself; so there are two things, the mind and the knowledge of it,
when it knows itself. Therefore the mind itself, and the love of
it, and the knowledge of it, are three things (<i>tria
qu&#230;dam</i>), and these three are one; and when they are perfect
they are equal. For if one loves himself less than as he is,&#8212;as
for example, suppose that the mind of a man only loves itself as
much as the body of a man ought to be loved, whereas the mind is
more than the body,&#8212;then it is in fault, and its love is not
perfect. Again, if it loves itself more than as it is,&#8212;as if, for
instance, it loves itself as much as God is to be loved, whereas
the mind is incomparably less than God,&#8212;here also it is
exceedingly in fault, and its love of self is not perfect. But it
is in fault more perversely and wrongly still, when it loves the
body as much as God is to be loved. Also, if knowledge is less than
that thing which is known, and which can be fully known, then
knowledge is not perfect; but if it is greater, then the nature
which knows is above that which is known, as the knowledge of the
body is greater than the body itself, which is known by that
knowledge. For knowledge is a kind of life in the reason of the
knower, but the body is not life; and any life is greater than any
body, not in bulk, but in power. But when the mind knows itself,
its own knowledge does not rise above itself, because itself knows,
and itself is known. When, therefore, it knows itself entirely, and
no other thing with itself, then its knowledge is equal to itself;
because its knowledge is not from another nature, since it knows
itself. And when it perceives itself entirely, and nothing more,
then it is neither less nor greater. We said therefore rightly,
that these three things, [mind, love, and knowledge], when they are
perfect, are by consequence equal.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.iv-p3">5. Similar reasoning suggests to
us, if indeed we can any way understand the matter, that these
things [<i>i.e.</i> love and knowledge] exist in the soul, and
that, being as it were involved in it, they are so evolved from it
as to be perceived and reckoned up substantially, or, so to say,
essentially. Not as though in a subject; as color, or shape, or any
other quality or quantity, are in the body. For anything of this
[material] kind does not go beyond the subject in which it is; for
the color or shape of this particular body cannot be also those of
another body. But the mind can also love something besides itself,
with that love with which it loves itself. And further, the mind
does not know itself only, but also many other things. Wherefore
love and knowledge are not contained in the mind as in a subject,
but these also exist <i>substantially, as the mind itself does</i>;
because, even if they are mutually predicated relatively,
yet <pb n="128" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_128.html" id="iv.i.xi.iv-Page_128"/>they exist each severally in their own substance. Nor
are they so mutually predicated relatively as color and the colored
subject are; so that color is in the colored subject, but has not
any proper substance in itself, since colored body is a substance,
but color is in a substance; but as two friends are also two men,
which are substances, while they are said to be men not relatively,
but friends relatively.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.iv-p4">6. But, further, although one who
loves or one who knows is a substance, and <i>knowledge is a
substance</i>, and <i>love is a substance</i>, but he that loves
and love, or, he that knows and knowledge, are spoken of relatively
to each other, as are friends: yet mind or spirit are not
relatives, as neither are men relatives: nevertheless he that loves
and love, or he that knows and knowledge, cannot exist separately
from each other, as men can that are friends. Although it would
seem that friends, too, can be separated in body, not in mind, in
as far as they are friends: nay, it can even happen that a friend
may even also begin to hate a friend and on this account cease to
be a friend while the other does not know it, and still loves him.
But if the love with which the mind loves itself ceases to be, then
the mind also will at the same time cease to love. Likewise, if the
knowledge by which the mind knows itself ceases to be, then the
mind will also at the same time cease to know itself. Just as the
head of anything that has a head is certainly a head, and they are
predicated relatively to each other, although they are also
substances: for both a head is a body, and so is that which has a
head; and if there be no head, then neither will there be that
which has a head. Only these things can be separated from each
other by cutting off, those cannot.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.iv-p5">7. And even if there are some
bodies which cannot be wholly separated and divided, yet they would
not be bodies unless they consisted of their own proper parts. A
part then is predicated relatively to a whole, since every part is
a part of some whole, and a whole is a whole by having all its
parts. But since both part and whole are bodies, these things are
not only predicated relatively, but exist also substantially.
Perhaps, then, the mind is a whole, and the love with which it
loves itself, and the knowledge with which it knows itself, are as
it were its parts, of which two parts that whole consists. Or are
there three equal parts which make up the one whole? But no part
embraces the whole, of which it is a part; whereas, when the mind
knows itself as a whole, that is, knows itself perfectly, then the
knowledge of it extends through the whole of it; and when it loves
itself perfectly, then it loves itself as a whole, and the love of
it extends through the whole of it. Is it, then, as one drink is
made from wine and water and honey, and each single part extends
through the whole, and yet they are three things (for there is no
part of the drink which does not contain these three things; for
they are not joined as if they were water and oil, but are entirely
commingled: and they are all substances, and the whole of that
liquor which is composed of the three is one substance),&#8212;is it, I
say, in some such way as this we are to think these three to be
together, mind, love, and knowledge? But water, wine, and honey are
not of one substance, although one substance results in the drink
made from the commingling of them. And I cannot see how those other
three are not of the same substance, since the mind itself loves
itself, and itself knows itself; and these three so exist, as that
the mind is neither loved nor known by any other thing at all.
These three, therefore, must needs be of one and the same essence;
and for that reason, if they were confounded together as it were by
a commingling, they could not be in any way three, neither could
they be mutually referred to each other. Just as if you were to
make from one and the same gold three similar rings, although
connected with each other, they are mutually referred to each
other, because they are similar. For everything similar is similar
to something, and there is a trinity of rings, and one gold. But if
they are blended with each other, and each mingled with the other
through the whole of their own bulk, then that trinity will fall
through, and it will not exist at all; and not only will it be
called one gold, as it was called in the case of those three rings,
but now it will not be called three things of gold at
all.</p>

These Three are Several in Themselves, and Mutually All in

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.v-p2">8. But in these three, when the
mind knows itself and loves itself, there remains a trinity: mind,
love, knowledge; and this trinity is not confounded together by any
commingling: although they are each severally in themselves and
mutually all in all, or each severally in each two, or each two in
each. Therefore all are in all. For certainly the mind is in
itself, since it is called mind in respect to itself: although it
is said to be knowing, or known, or knowable, relatively to its own
knowledge; and although also as <pb n="129" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_129.html" id="iv.i.xi.v-Page_129"/>loving, and loved, or lovable,
it is referred to love, by which it loves itself. And knowledge,
although it is referred to the mind that knows or is known,
nevertheless is also predicated both as known and knowing in
respect to itself: for the knowledge by which the mind knows itself
is not unknown to itself. And although love is referred to the mind
that loves, whose love it is; nevertheless it is also love in
respect to itself, so as to exist also in itself: since love too is
loved, yet cannot be loved with anything except with love, that is
with itself. So these things are severally in themselves. But so
are they in each other; because both the mind that loves is <i>
in</i> love, and love is in the knowledge of him that loves, and
knowledge is <i>in</i> the mind that knows. And each severally is
in like manner in each two, because the mind which knows and loves
itself, is in its own love and knowledge: and the love of the mind
that loves and knows itself, is in the mind and in its knowledge:
and the knowledge of the mind that knows and loves itself is in the
mind and in its love, because it loves itself that knows, and knows
itself that loves. And hence also each two is in each severally,
since the mind which knows and loves itself, is together with its
own knowledge in love, and together with its own love in knowledge;
and love too itself and knowledge are together in the mind, which
loves and knows itself. But in what way all are in all, we have
already shown above; since the mind loves itself as a whole, and
knows itself as a whole, and knows its own love wholly, and loves
its own knowledge wholly, when these three things are perfect in
respect to themselves. Therefore these three things are
marvellously inseparable from each other, and yet each of them is
severally a substance, and all together are one substance or
essence, whilst they are mutually predicated relatively.<note place="end" n="706" id="iv.i.xi.v-p2.1"><p id="iv.i.xi.v-p3"> [Augustin here illustrates, by the ternary of mind,

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.vi-p2">9. But when the human mind knows
itself and loves itself, it does not know and love anything
unchangeable: and each individual man declares his own particular
mind by one manner of speech, when he considers what takes place in
himself; but defines the human mind abstractly by special or
general knowledge. And so, when he speaks to me of his own
individual mind, as to whether he understands this or that, or does
not understand it, or whether he wishes or does not wish this or
that, I believe; but when he speaks the truth of the mind of man
generally or specially, I recognize and approve. Whence it is
manifest, that each sees a thing in himself, in such way that
another person may believe what he says of it, yet may not see it;
but another [sees a thing] in the truth itself, in such way that
another person also can gaze upon it; of which the former undergoes
changes at successive times, the latter consists in an unchangeable
eternity. For we do not gather a generic or specific knowledge of
the human mind by means of resemblance by seeing many minds with
the eyes of the body: but we gaze upon indestructible truth, from
which to define perfectly, as far as we can, not of what sort is
the mind of any one particular man, but of what sort it ought to be
upon the eternal plan.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.vi-p3">10. Whence also, even in the case
of the images of things corporeal which are drawn in through the
bodily sense, and in some way infused into the memory, from which
also those things which have not been seen are thought under a
fancied image, whether otherwise than they really are, or even
perchance as they are;&#8212;even here too, we are proved either to
accept or reject, within ourselves, by other rules which remain
altogether unchangeable above our mind, when we approve or reject
anything rightly. For both when I recall the walls of Carthage
which I have seen, and imagine to myself the walls of Alexandria
which I have not seen, and, in preferring this to that among forms
which in both cases are imaginary, make that preference upon
grounds of reason; the judgment of truth from above is still strong
and clear, and rests firmly upon the utterly indestructible rules
of its own right; and if it is covered as it were by cloudiness of
corporeal images, yet is not wrapt up and confounded in
them.</p>

whether, <pb n="130" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_130.html" id="iv.i.xi.vi-Page_130"/>under that or in that darkness, I am shut off as it were
from the clear heaven; or whether (as usually happens on lofty
mountains), enjoying the free air between both, I at once look up
above to the calmest light, and down below upon the densest clouds.
For whence is the ardor of brotherly love kindled in me, when I
hear that some man has borne bitter torments for the excellence and
steadfastness of faith? And if that man is shown to me with the
finger, I am eager to join myself to him, to become acquainted with
him, to bind him to myself in friendship. And accordingly, if
opportunity offers, I draw near, I address him, I converse with
him, I express my goodwill towards him in what words I can, and
wish that in him too in turn should be brought to pass and
expressed goodwill towards me; and I endeavor after a spiritual
embrace in the way of belief, since I cannot search out so quickly
and discern altogether his innermost heart. I love therefore the
faithful and courageous man with a pure and genuine love. But if he
were to confess to me in the course of conversation, or were
through unguardedness to show in any way, that either he believes
something unseemly of God, and desires also something carnal in
Him, and that he bore these torments on behalf of such an error, or
from the desire of money for which he hoped, or from empty
greediness of human praise: immediately it follows that the love
with which I was borne towards him, displeased, and as it were
repelled, and taken away from an unworthy man, remains in that
form, after which, believing him such as I did, I had loved him;
unless perhaps I have come to love him to this end, that he may
become such, while I have found him not to be such in fact. And in
that man, too, nothing is changed: although it can be changed, so
that he may become that which I had believed him to be already. But
in my mind there certainly is something changed, <i>viz</i>., the
estimate I had formed of him, which was before of one sort, and now
is of another: and the same love, at the bidding from above of
unchangeable righteousness, is turned aside from the purpose of
enjoying, to the purpose of taking counsel. But the form itself of
unshaken and stable truth, wherein I should have enjoyed the
fruition of the man, believing him to be good, and wherein likewise
I take counsel that he may be good, sheds in an immoveable eternity
the same light of incorruptible and most sound reason, both upon
the sight of my mind, and upon that cloud of images, which I
discern from above, when I think of the same man whom I had seen.
Again, when I call back to my mind some arch, turned beautifully
and symmetrically, which, let us say, I saw at Carthage; a certain
reality that had been made known to the mind through the eyes, and
transferred to the memory, causes the imaginary view. But I behold
in my mind yet another thing, according to which that work of art
pleases me; and whence also, if it displeased me, I should correct
it. We judge therefore of those particular things according to that
[form of eternal truth], and discern that form by the intuition of
the rational mind. But those things themselves we either touch if
present by the bodily sense, or if absent remember their images as
fixed in our memory, or picture, in the way of likeness to them,
such things as we ourselves also, if we wished and were able, would
laboriously build up: figuring in the mind after one fashion the
images of bodies, or seeing bodies through the body; but after
another, grasping by simple intelligence what is above the eye of
the mind, <i>viz</i>., the reasons and the unspeakably beautiful
skill of such forms.</p>

desire or by love: not that the creature ought not to be loved; but
if that love [of the creature] is referred to the Creator, then it
will not be desire (<i>cupiditas</i>), but love (<i>charitas</i>).
For it is desire when the creature is loved for itself. And then it
does not help a man through making use of it, but corrupts him in
the enjoying it. When, therefore, the creature is either equal to
us or inferior, we must use the inferior in order to God, but we
must enjoy the equal duly in God. For as thou oughtest to enjoy
thyself, not in thyself, but in Him who made thee, so also him whom
thou lovest as thyself. Let us enjoy, therefore, both ourselves and
our brethren in the Lord; and hence let us not dare to yield, and
as it were to relax, ourselves to ourselves in the direction
downwards. Now a word is born, when, being thought out, it pleases
us either to the effect of sinning, or to that of doing right.
Therefore love, as it were a mean, conjoins our word and the mind
from which it is conceived, and without any confusion binds itself
as a third with them, in an incorporeal embrace.</p>

But in the love of carnal and temporal things, as in the offspring

gold, except it also have it; nor to know and love to eat, or to

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.x-p2">15. It is rightly asked then,
whether all knowledge is a word, or only knowledge that is loved.
For we also know the things which we hate; but what we do not like,
cannot be said to be either conceived or brought forth by the mind.
For not all things which in anyway touch it, are conceived by it;
but some only reach the point of being known, but yet are not
spoken as words, as for instance those of which we speak now. For
those are called words in one way, which occupy spaces of time by
their syllables, whether they are pronounced or only thought; and
in another way, all that is known is called a word imprinted on the
mind, as long as it can be brought forth from the memory and
defined, even though we dislike the thing itself; and in another
way still, when we like that which is conceived in the mind. And
that which the apostle says, must be taken according to this last
kind of word, &#8220;No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the
Holy Ghost;&#8221;<note place="end" n="717" id="iv.i.xi.x-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xi.x-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xii. 3" id="iv.i.xi.x-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|12|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.3">1 Cor. xii. 3</scripRef></p></note> since those
also say this, but according to another meaning of the term
&#8220;word,&#8221; of whom the Lord Himself says, &#8220;Not every one that
saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of

the case of things which we hate, when we rightly dislike and
rightly censure them, we approve and like the censure bestowed upon
them, and it becomes a word. Nor is it the knowledge of vices that
displeases us, but the <pb n="132" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_132.html" id="iv.i.xi.x-Page_132"/>vices themselves. For I like to
know and define what intemperance is; and this is its word. Just as
there are known faults in art, and the knowledge of them is rightly
approved, when a connoisseur discerns the species or the privation
of excellence, as to affirm and deny that it is or that it is not;
yet to be without excellence and to fall away into fault, is worthy
of condemnation. And to define intemperance, and to say its word,
belongs to the art of morals; but to be intemperate belongs to that
which that art censures. Just as to know and define what a solecism
is, belongs to the art of speaking; but to be guilty of one, is a
fault which the same art reprehends. A word, then, which is the
point we wish now to discern and intimate, is knowledge together
with love. Whenever, then, the mind knows and loves itself, its
word is joined to it by love. And since it loves knowledge and
knows love, both the word is in love and love is in the word, and
both are in him who loves and speaks.<note place="end" n="719" id="iv.i.xi.x-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xi.x-p5"> [The meaning of this obscure
chapter seems to be, that only what the mind is pleased with, is
the real expression and index of the mind&#8212;its true &#8220;word.&#8221;
The true nature of the mind is revealed in its sympathies. But this
requires some qualification. For in the case of contrary qualities,
like right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, the real nature of the
mind is seen also in its antipathy as well as in its sympathy; in
its hatred of wrong as well as in its love of right. Each alike is
a true index of the mind, because each really implies the
other.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note></p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xi.xi-p1.1">Chapter 11.&#8212;That the Image or Begotten Word of the
Mind that Knows Itself is Equal to the Mind Itself.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.xi-p2">16. But all knowledge according to
species is like the thing which it knows. For there is another
knowledge according to privation, according to which we speak a
word only when we condemn. And this condemnation of a privation is
equivalent to praise of the species, and so is approved. The mind,
then, contains some likeness to a known species, whether when
liking that species or when disliking its privation. And hence, in
so far as we know God, we are like Him, but not like to the point
of equality, since we do not know Him to the extent of His own
being. And as, when we speak of bodies by means of the bodily
sense, there arises in our mind some likeness of them, which is a
phantasm of the memory; for the bodies themselves are not at all in
the mind, when we think them, but only the likenesses of those
bodies; therefore, when we approve the latter for the former, we
err, for the approving of one thing for another is an error; yet
the image of the body in the mind is a thing of a better sort than
the species of the body itself, inasmuch as the former is in a
better nature, <i>viz</i>. in a living substance, as the mind is:
so when we know God, although we are made better than we were
before we knew Him, and above all when the same knowledge being
also liked and worthily loved becomes a word, and so that knowledge
becomes a kind of likeness of God; yet that knowledge is of a lower
kind, since it is in a lower nature; for the mind is creature, but
God is Creator. And from this it may be inferred, that when the
mind knows and approves itself, this same knowledge is in such way
its word, as that it is altogether on a par and equal with it, and
the same; because it is neither the knowledge of a lower essence,
as of the body, nor of a higher, as of God. And whereas knowledge
bears a likeness to that which it knows, that is, of which it is
the knowledge; in this case it has perfect and equal likeness, when
the mind itself, which knows, is known. And so it is both image and
word; because it is uttered concerning that mind to which it is
equalled in knowing, and that which is begotten is equal to the
begetter.</p>

the Offspring of the Mind, as Knowledge is So. The Solution of the
Question. The Mind with the Knowledge of Itself and the Love of
Itself is the Image of the Trinity.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.xii-p2">17. What then is love? Will it not
be an image? Will it not be a word? Will it not be begotten? For
why does the mind beget its knowledge when it knows itself, and not
beget its love when it loves itself? For if it is the cause of its
own knowing, for the reason that it is knowable, it is also the
cause of its own love because it is lovable. It is hard, then, to
say why it does not beget both. For there is a further question
also respecting the supreme Trinity itself, the omnipotent God the
Creator, after whose image man is made, which troubles men, whom
the truth of God invites to the faith by human speech; <i>viz</i>.
why the Holy Spirit is not also to be either believed or understood
to be begotten by God the Father, so that He also may be called a
Son. And this question we are endeavoring in some way to
investigate in the human mind, in order that from a lower image, in
which our own nature itself as it were answers, upon being
questioned, in a way more familiar to ourselves, we may be able to
direct a more practised mental vision from the enlightened creature
to the unchangeable light; assuming, however, that the truth itself
has persuaded us, that as no Christian doubts the Word of God to be
the Son, so that the Holy Spirit is love. Let us return, then, to a
more careful questioning and consideration upon this subject of
that image which is the creature, that is, of the rational mind;
wherein the knowl<pb n="133" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_133.html" id="iv.i.xi.xii-Page_133"/>edge of some things coming into
existence in time, but which did not exist before, and the love of
some things which were not loved before, opens to us more clearly
what to say: because to speech also itself, which must be disposed
in time, that thing is easier of explanation which is comprehended
in the order of time.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xi.xii-p3">18. First, therefore, it is clear
that a thing may possibly be knowable, that is, such as can be
known, and yet that it may be unknown; but that it is not possible
for that to be known which is not knowable. Wherefore it must be
clearly held that everything whatsoever that we know begets at the
same time in us the knowledge of itself; for knowledge is brought
forth from both, from the knower and from the thing known. When,
therefore, the mind knows itself, it alone is the parent of its own
knowledge; for it is itself both the thing known and the knower of
it. But it was knowable to itself also before it knew itself, only
the knowledge of itself was not in itself so long as it did not
know itself. In knowing itself, then, it begets a knowledge of
itself equal to itself; since it does not know itself as less than
itself is, nor is its knowledge the knowledge of the essence of
some one else, not only because itself knows, but also because it
knows itself, as we have said above. What then is to be said of
love; why, when the mind loves itself, it should not seem also to
have begotten the love of itself? For it was lovable to itself even
before it loved itself since it could love itself; just as it was
knowable to itself even before it knew itself, since it could know
itself. For if it were not knowable to itself, it never could have
known itself; and so, if it were not lovable to itself, it never
could have loved itself. Why therefore may it not be said by loving
itself to have begotten its own love, as by knowing itself it has
begotten its own knowledge? Is it because it is thereby indeed
plainly shown that this is the principle of love, whence it
proceeds? for it proceeds from the mind itself, which is lovable to
itself before it loves itself, and so is the principle of its own
love by which it loves itself: but that this love is not therefore
rightly said to be begotten by the mind, as is the knowledge of
itself by which the mind knows itself, because in the case of
knowledge the thing has been found already, which is what we call
brought forth or discovered;<note place="end" n="720" id="iv.i.xi.xii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xi.xii-p4"> &#8220;<i>Partum</i>&#8221; or
&#8220;<i>repertum</i>.&#8221;</p></note> and this is commonly preceded by an
inquiry such as to find rest when that end is attained. For inquiry
is the desire of finding, or, what is the same thing, of
discovering.<note place="end" n="721" id="iv.i.xi.xii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xi.xii-p5"> 
&#8220;<i>Reperiendi</i>.&#8221;</p></note> But those
things which are discovered are as it were brought forth, whence
they are like offspring; but wherein, except in the case itself of
knowledge? For in that case they are as it were uttered and
fashioned. For although the things existed already which we found
by seeking, yet the knowledge of them did not exist, which
knowledge we regard as an offspring that is born. Further, the
desire (<i>appetitus</i>) which there is in seeking proceeds from
him who seeks, and is in some way in suspense, and does not rest in
the end whither it is directed, except that which is sought be
found and conjoined with him who seeks. And this desire, that is,
inquiry,&#8212;although it does not seem to be love, by which that
which is known is loved, for in this case we are still striving to
know,&#8212;yet it is something of the same kind. For it can be called
will (<i>voluntas</i>), since every one who seeks wills
(<i>vult</i>) to find; and if that is sought which belongs to
knowledge, every one who seeks wills to know. But if he wills
ardently and earnestly, he is said to study (<i>studere</i>): a
word that is most commonly employed in the case of pursuing and
obtaining any branches of learning. Therefore, the bringing forth
of the mind is preceded by some desire, by which, through seeking
and finding what we wish to know, the offspring, <i>viz</i>.
knowledge itself, is born. And for this reason, that desire by
which knowledge is conceived and brought forth, cannot rightly be
called the bringing forth and the offspring; and the same desire
which led us to long for the knowing of the thing, becomes the love
of the thing when known, while it holds and embraces its accepted
offspring, that is, knowledge, and unites it to its begetter. And
so there is a kind of image of the Trinity in the mind itself, and
the knowledge of it, which is its offspring and its word concerning
itself, and love as a third, and these three are one, and one
substance.<note place="end" n="722" id="iv.i.xi.xii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xi.xii-p6"> [It is not these three together
that <i>constitute</i> the one substance. The mind alone is the
substance&#8212;the knowledge and the love being only two activities of
it. When the mind is not cognizing or loving, it is still an entire
mind. As previously remarked in the annotation on IX. ii. this
ternary will completely illustrate a trinality of a certain kind,
but not that of the Trinity; in which the &#8220;<i>tria qu&#230;dam</i>&#8221;
are three subsistences, each of which is so substantial as to be
the subject of attributes, and to be able to employ them. The human
mind is substantial enough to possess and employ the attributes of
knowledge and love. We say that the mind knows and loves. But an
<i>activity</i> of the mind is not substantial enough to possess
and employ the attributes of knowledge and love. We cannot say that
the loving loves; or the loving knows; or the knowing loves,
etc.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> Neither is
the offspring less, since the mind knows itself according to the
measure of its own being; nor is the love less, since it loves
itself according to the measure both of its own knowledge and of
its own being.</p>

Studious Mind, that Is, of One Desirous to Know, is Not the Love of

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.i-p2">1. <span class="c19" id="iv.i.xii.i-p2.1">
Let</span> us now proceed, then, in due order,
with a more exact purpose, to explain this same point more
thoroughly. And first, since no one can love at all a thing of
which he is wholly ignorant, we must carefully consider of what
sort is the love of those who are studious, that is, of those who
do not already know, but are still desiring to know any branch of
learning. Now certainly, in those things whereof the word study is
not commonly used, love often arises from hearsay, when the
reputation of anything for beauty inflames the mind to the seeing
and enjoying it; since the mind knows generically wherein consist
the beauties of corporeal things, from having seen them very
frequently, and since there exists within a faculty of approving
that which outwardly is longed for. And when this happens, the love
that is called forth is not of a thing wholly unknown, since its
genus is thus known. But when we love a good man whose face we
never saw, we love him from the knowledge of his virtues, which
virtues we know [abstractly] in the truth itself. But in the case
of learning, it is for the most part the authority of others who
praise and commend it that kindles our love of it; although
nevertheless we could not burn with any zeal at all for the study
of it, unless we had already in our mind at least a slight
impression of the knowledge of each kind of learning. For who, for
instance, would devote any care and labor to the learning of
rhetoric, unless he knew before that it was the science of
speaking? Sometimes, again, we marvel at the results of learning
itself, which we have heard of or experienced; and hence burn to
obtain, by learning, the power of attaining these results. Just as
if it were said to one who did not know his letters, that there is
a kind of learning which enables a man to send words, wrought with
the hand in silence, to one who is ever so far absent, for him in
turn to whom they are sent to gather these words, not with his
ears, but with his eyes; and if the man were to see the thing
actually done, is not that man, since he desires to know how he can
do this thing, altogether moved to study with a view to the result
which he already knows and holds? So it is that the studious zeal
of those who learn is kindled: for that of which any one is utterly
ignorant, he can in no way love.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.i-p3">2. So also, if any one hear an
unknown sign, as, for instance, the sound of some word of which he
does not know the signification, he desires to know what it is;
that is, he desires to know what thing it is which it is agreed
shall be brought to mind by that sound: as if he heard the word <i>
temetum</i><note place="end" n="723" id="iv.i.xii.i-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xii.i-p4"> Wine.</p></note> uttered, and
not knowing, should ask what it is. He must then know already that
it is a sign, <i>i.e.</i> that the word is not an empty sound, but
that something is signified by it; for in other respects this
trisyllabic word is known to him already, and has already impressed
its articulate form upon his mind through the sense of hearing. And
then what more is to be required in him, that he may go on to a
greater knowledge of that of which all the letters and all the
spaces of its several sounds are already known, unless that it
shall at the same time have become known to him that it is a sign,
and shall have also moved him with the desire of knowing of what it
is the sign? The more, then, the thing is known, yet not fully
known, the more the mind desires to know concerning it what remains
to be known. For if he <pb n="135" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_135.html" id="iv.i.xii.i-Page_135"/>knew it to be only such and
such a spoken word, and did not know that it was the sign of
something, he would seek nothing further, since the sensible thing
is already perceived as far as it can be by the sense. But because
he knows it to be not only a spoken word, but also a sign, he
wishes to know it perfectly; and no sign is known perfectly, except
it be known of what it is the sign. He then who with ardent
carefulness seeks to know this, and inflamed by studious zeal
perseveres in the search; can such an one be said to be without
love? What then does he love? For certainly nothing can be loved
unless it is known. For that man does not love those three
syllables which he knows already. But if he loves this in them,
that he knows them to signify something, this is not the point now
in question, for it is not this which he seeks to know. But we are
now asking what it is he loves, in that which he is desirous to
know, but which certainly he does not yet know; and we are
therefore wondering why he loves, since we know most assuredly that
nothing can be loved unless it be known. What then does he love,
except that he knows and perceives in the reason of things what
excellence there is in learning, in which the knowledge of all
signs is contained; and what benefit there is in the being skilled
in these, since by them human fellowship mutually communicates its
own perceptions, lest the assemblies of men should be actually
worse than utter solitude, if they were not to mingle their
thoughts by conversing together? The soul, then, discerns this
fitting and serviceable species, and knows it, and loves it; and he
who seeks the meaning of any words of which he is ignorant, studies
to render that species perfect in himself as much as he can: for it
is one thing to behold it in the light of truth, another to desire
it as within his own capacity. For he beholds in the light of truth
how great and how good a thing it is to understand and to speak all
tongues of all nations, and so to hear no tongue and to be heard by
none as from a foreigner. The beauty, then, of this knowledge is
already discerned by thought, and the thing being known is loved;
and that thing is so regarded, and so stimulates the studious zeal
of learners, that they are moved with respect to it, and desire it
eagerly in all the labor which they spend upon the attainment of
such a capacity, in order that they may also embrace in practice
that which they know beforehand by reason. And so every one, the
nearer he approaches that capacity in hope, the more fervently
desires it with love; for those branches of learning are studied
the more eagerly, which men do not despair of being able to attain;
for when any one entertains no hope of attaining his end, then he
either loves lukewarmly or does not love at all, howsoever he may
see the excellence of it. Accordingly, because the knowledge of all
languages is almost universally felt to be hopeless, every one
studies most to know that of his own nation; but if he feels that
he is not sufficient even to comprehend this perfectly, yet no one
is so indolent in this knowledge as not to wish to know, when he
hears an unknown word, what it is, and to seek and learn it if he
can. And while he is seeking it, certainly he has a studious zeal
of learning, and seems to love a thing he does not know; but the
case is really otherwise. For that species touches the mind, which
the mind knows and thinks, wherein the fitness is clearly visible
which accrues from the associating of minds with one another, in
the hearing and returning of known and spoken words. And this
species kindles studious zeal in him who seeks what indeed he knows
not, but gazes upon and loves the unknown form to which that
pertains. If then, for example, any one were to ask, What is <i>
temetum</i> (for I had instanced this word already), and it were
said to him, What does this matter to you? he will answer, Lest
perhaps I hear some one speaking, and understand him not; or
perhaps read the word somewhere, and know not what the writer
meant. Who, pray, would say to such an inquirer, Do not care about
understanding what you hear; do not care about knowing what you
read? For almost every rational soul quickly discerns the beauty of
that knowledge, through which the thoughts of men are mutually made
known by the enunciation of significant words; and it is on account
of this fitness thus known, and because known therefore loved, that
such an unknown word is studiously sought out. When then he hears
and learns that wine was called &#8220;<i>temetum</i>&#8221; by our
forefathers, but that the word is already quite obsolete in our
present usage of language, he will think perhaps that he has still
need of the word on account of this or that book of those
forefathers. But if he holds these also to be superfluous, perhaps
he does now come to think the word not worth remembering, since he
sees it has nothing to do with that species of learning which he
knows with the mind, and gazes upon, and so loves.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.i-p5">3. Wherefore in all cases the love
of a studious mind, that is, of one that wishes to know what it
does not know, is not the love of that thing which it does not
know, but of that which it knows; on account of which it
<pb n="136" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_136.html" id="iv.i.xii.i-Page_136"/>wishes
to know what it does not know. Or if it is so inquisitive as to be
carried away, not for any other cause known to it, but by the mere
love of knowing things unknown; then such an inquisitive person is,
doubtless distinguishable from an ordinary student, yet does not,
any more than he, love things he does not know; nay, on the
contrary, he is more fitly said to hate things he knows not, of
which he wishes that there should be none, in wishing to know
everything. But lest any one should lay before us a more difficult
question, by declaring that it is just as impossible for any one to
hate what he does not know, as to love what he does not know, we
will not withstand what is true; but it must be understood that it
is not the same thing to say he loves to know things unknown, as to
say he loves things unknown. For it is possible that a man may love
to know things unknown; but it is not possible that he should love
things unknown. For the word to know is not placed there without
meaning; since he who loves to know things unknown, does not love
the unknown things themselves, but the knowing of them. And unless
he knew what knowing means, no one could say confidently, either
that he knew or that he did not know. For not only he who says I
know, and says so truly, must needs know what knowing is; but he
also who says, I do not know, and says so confidently and truly,
and knows that he says so truly, certainly knows what knowing is;
for he both distinguishes him who does not know from him who knows,
when he looks into himself and says truly I do not know; and
whereas he knows that he says this truly, whence should he know it,
if he did not know what knowing is?</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xii.ii-p1.1">Chapter 2.&#8212;No One at All Loves Things
Unknown.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.ii-p2">4. No studious person, then, no
inquisitive person, loves things he does not know, even while he is
urgent with the most vehement desire to know what he does not know.
For he either knows already generically what he loves, and longs to
know it also in some individual or individuals, which perhaps are
praised, but not yet known to him; and he pictures in his mind an
imaginary form by which he may be stirred to love. And whence does
he picture this, except from those things which he has already
known? And yet perhaps he will not love it, if he find that form
which was praised to be unlike that other form which was figured
and in thought most fully known to his mind. And if he has loved
it, he will begin to love it from that time when he learned it;
since a little before, that form which was loved was other than
that which the mind that formed it had been wont to exhibit to
itself. But if he shall find it similar to that form which report
had proclaimed, and to be such that he could truly say I was
already loving thee; yet certainly not even then did he love a form
he did not know, since he had known it in that likeness. Or else we
see somewhat in the species of the eternal reason, and therein love
it; and when this is manifested in some image of a temporal thing,
and we believe the praises of those who have made trial of it, and
so love it, then we do not love anything unknown, according to that
which we have already sufficiently discussed above. Or else, again,
we love something known, and on account of it seek something
unknown; and so it is by no means the love of the thing unknown
that possesses us, but the love of the thing known, to which we
know the unknown thing belongs, so that we know that too which we
seek still as unknown; as a little before I said of an unknown
word. Or else, again, every one loves the very knowing itself, as
no one can fail to know who desires to know anything. For these
reasons they seem to love things unknown who wish to know anything
which they do not know, and who, on account of their vehement
desire of inquiry, cannot be said to be without love. But how
different the case really is, and that nothing at all can be loved
which is not known, I think I must have persuaded every one who
carefully looks upon truth. But since the examples which we have
given belong to those who desire to know something which they
themselves are not, we must take thought lest perchance some new
notion appear, when the mind desires to know itself.</p>

<div4 type="Chapter" title="That When the Mind Loves Itself, It is Not Unknown to Itself." n="3" shorttitle="Chapter 3" progress="25.55%" prev="iv.i.xii.ii" next="iv.i.xii.iv" id="iv.i.xii.iii"><p class="c39" id="iv.i.xii.iii-p1">

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xii.iii-p1.1">Chapter 3.&#8212;That
When the Mind Loves Itself, It is Not Unknown to Itself.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.iii-p2">5. What, then, does the mind love,
when it seeks ardently to know itself, whilst it is still unknown
to itself? For, behold, the mind seeks to know itself, and is
excited thereto by studious zeal. It loves, therefore; but what
does it love? Is it itself? But how can this be when it does not
yet know itself, and no one can love what he does not know? Is it
that report has declared to it its own species, in like way as we
commonly hear of people who are absent? Perhaps, then, it does not
love itself, but loves that which it imagines of itself, which is
perhaps widely different from what itself is: or if the phantasy in
the mind is like the mind itself, and 
<pb n="137" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_137.html" id="iv.i.xii.iii-Page_137"/>so when it loves this
fancied image, it loves itself before it knew itself, because it
gazes upon that which is like itself; then it knew other minds from
which to picture itself, and so is known to itself generically.
Why, then, when it knows other minds, does it not know itself,
since nothing can possibly be more present to it than itself? But
if, as other eyes are more known to the eyes of the body, than
those eyes are to themselves; then let it not seek itself, because
it never will find itself. For eyes can never see themselves except
in looking-glasses; and it cannot be supposed in any way that
anything of that kind can be applied also to the contemplation of
incorporeal things, so that the mind should know itself, as it
were, in a looking-glass. Or does it see in the reason of eternal
truth how beautiful it is to know one&#8217;s self, and so loves this
which it sees, and studies to bring it to pass in itself? because,
although it is not known to itself, yet it is known to it how good
it is, that it should be known to itself. And this, indeed, is very
wonderful, that it does not yet know itself, and yet knows already
how excellent a thing it is to know itself. Or does it see some
most excellent end, <i>viz</i>. its own serenity and blessedness,
by some hidden remembrance, which has not abandoned it, although it
has gone far onwards, and believes that it cannot attain to that
same end unless it know itself? And so while it loves that, it
seeks this; and loves that which is known, on account of which it
seeks that which is unknown. But why should the remembrance of its
own blessedness be able to last, and the remembrance of itself not
be able to last as well; that so it should know itself which wishes
to attain, as well as know that to which it wishes to attain? Or
when it loves to know itself, does it love, not itself, which it
does not yet know, but the very act of knowing; and feel the more
annoyed that itself is wanting to its own knowledge wherewith it
wishes to embrace all things? And it knows what it is to know; and
whilst it loves this, which it knows, desires also to know itself.
Whereby, then, does it know its own knowing, if it does not know
itself? For it knows that it knows other things, but that it does
not know itself; for it is from hence that it knows also what
knowing is. In what way, then, does that which does not know
itself, know itself as knowing anything? For it does not know that
some other mind knows, but that itself does so. Therefore it knows
itself. Further, when it seeks to know itself, it knows itself now
as seeking. Therefore again it knows itself. And hence it cannot
altogether not know itself, when certainly it does so far know
itself as that it knows itself as not knowing itself. But if it
does not know itself not to know itself, then it does not seek to
know itself. And therefore, in the very fact that it seeks itself,
it is clearly convicted of being more known to itself than unknown.
For it knows itself as seeking and as not knowing itself, in that
it seeks to know itself.</p>

<div4 type="Chapter" title="How the Mind Knows Itself, Not in Part, But as a Whole." n="4" shorttitle="Chapter 4" progress="25.70%" prev="iv.i.xii.iii" next="iv.i.xii.v" id="iv.i.xii.iv"><p class="c39" id="iv.i.xii.iv-p1">

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xii.iv-p1.1">Chapter 4.&#8212;How the Mind
Knows Itself, Not in Part, But as a Whole.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.iv-p2">6. What then shall we say? Does
that which knows itself in part, not know itself in part? But it is
absurd to say, that it does not as a whole know what it knows. I do
not say, it knows wholly; but what it knows, it as a whole knows.
When therefore it knows anything about itself, which it can only
know as a whole, it knows itself as a whole. But it does know that
itself knows something, while yet except as a whole it cannot know
anything. Therefore it knows itself as a whole. Further, what in it
is so known to itself, as that it lives? And it cannot at once be a
mind, and not live, while it has also something over and above, <i>
viz</i>., that it understands: for the souls of beasts also live,
but do not understand. As therefore a mind is a whole mind, so it
lives as a whole. But it knows that it lives. Therefore it knows
itself as a whole. Lastly, when the mind seeks to know itself, it
already knows that it is a mind: otherwise it knows not whether it
seeks itself, and perhaps seeks one thing while intending to seek
another. For it might happen that itself was not a mind, and so, in
seeking to know a mind, that it did not seek to know itself.
Wherefore since the mind, when it seeks to know what mind is, knows
that it seeks itself, certainly it knows that itself is a mind.
Furthermore, if it knows this in itself, that it is a mind, and a
whole mind, then it knows itself as a whole. But suppose it did not
know itself to be a mind, but in seeking itself only knew that it
did seek itself. For so, too, it may possibly seek one thing for
another, if it does not know this: but that it may not seek one
thing for another, without doubt it knows what it seeks. But if it
knows what it seeks, and seeks itself, then certainly it knows
itself. What therefore more does it seek? But if it knows itself in
part, but still seeks itself in part, then it seeks not itself, but
part of itself. For when we speak of the mind itself, we speak of
it as a whole. Further, because it knows that it is not yet found
by itself as a whole, it knows how much the whole is. And so it
seeks that <pb n="138" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_138.html" id="iv.i.xii.iv-Page_138"/>which is wanting, as we are wont to seek to recall to
the mind something that has slipped from the mind, but has not
altogether gone away from it; since we can recognize it, when it
has come back, to be the same thing that we were seeking. But how
can mind come into mind, as though it were possible for the mind
not to be in the mind? Add to this, that if, having found a part,
it does not seek itself as a whole, yet it as a whole seeks itself.
Therefore as a whole it is present to itself, and there is nothing
left to be sought: for that is wanting which is sought, not the
mind which seeks. Since therefore it as a whole seeks itself,
nothing of it is wanting. Or if it does not as a whole seek itself,
but the part which has been found seeks the part which has not yet
been found then the mind does not seek itself, of which no part
seeks itself. For the part which has been found, does not seek
itself; nor yet does the part itself which has not yet been found,
seek itself; since it is sought by that part which has been already
found. Wherefore, since neither the mind as a whole seeks itself,
nor does any part of it seek itself, the mind does not seek itself
at all.</p>

Whence Come the Errors of the Mind Concerning Its Own

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.v-p2">7. Why therefore is it enjoined
upon it, that it should know itself? I suppose, in order that, it
may consider itself, and live according to its own nature; that is,
seek to be regulated according to its own nature, <i>viz</i>.,
under Him to whom it ought to be subject, and above those things to
which it is to be preferred; under Him by whom it ought to be
ruled, above those things which it ought to rule. For it does many
things through vicious desire, as though in forgetfulness of
itself. For it sees some things intrinsically excellent, in that
more excellent nature which is God: and whereas it ought to remain
steadfast that it may enjoy them, it is turned away from Him, by
wishing to appropriate those things to itself, and not to be like
to Him by His gift, but to be what He is by its own, and it begins
to move and slip gradually down into less and less, which it thinks
to be more and more; for it is neither sufficient for itself, nor
is anything at all sufficient for it, if it withdraw from Him who
is alone sufficient: and so through want and distress it becomes
too intent upon its own actions and upon the unquiet delights which
it obtains through them: and thus, by the desire of acquiring
knowledge from those things that are without, the nature of which
it knows and loves, and which it feels can be lost unless held fast
with anxious care, it loses its security, and thinks of itself so
much the less, in proportion as it feels the more secure that it
cannot lose itself. So, whereas it is one thing not to know
oneself, and another not to think of oneself (for we do not say of
the man that is skilled in much learning, that he is ignorant of
grammar, when he is only not thinking of it, because he is thinking
at the time of the art of medicine);&#8212;whereas, then, I say it is
one thing not to know oneself, and another not to think of oneself,
such is the strength of love, that the mind draws in with itself
those things which it has long thought of with love, and has grown
into them by the close adherence of diligent study, even when it
returns in some way to think of itself. And because these things
are corporeal which it loved externally through the carnal senses;
and because it has become entangled with them by a kind of daily
familiarity, and yet cannot carry those corporeal things themselves
with itself internally as it were into the region of incorporeal
nature; therefore it combines certain images of them, and thrusts
them thus made from itself into itself. For it gives to the forming
of them somewhat of its own substance, yet preserves the while
something by which it may judge freely of the species of those
images; and this something is more properly the mind, that is, the
rational understanding, which is preserved that it may judge. For
we see that we have those parts of the soul which are informed by
the likenesses of corporeal things, in common also with
beasts.</p>

lovingly and intimately connects itself with these images, as even
to consider itself to be something of the same kind. For so it is
conformed to them to some extent, not by being this, but by
thinking it is so: not that it thinks itself to be an image, but
outright that very thing itself of which it entertains the image.
For there still lives in it the power of distinguishing the
corporeal thing which it leaves without, from the image of that
corporeal thing which it contains therefrom within itself: except
when these images are so projected as if felt without and not
thought within, as in the case of people who are asleep, or mad, or
in a trance.</p>

itself to be something of this kind, it thinks itself to be a
corporeal thing; and since it is perfectly conscious of its own
superiority, by which it rules the body, it has hence come to pass
that the question has been raised what part of the body has the
greater power in the body; and the opinion has been held that this
is the mind, nay, that it is even the whole soul altogether. And
some accordingly think it to be the blood, others the brain, others

metaphor is transferred from the body to the soul; but they have
simply thought it to be that small part itself of the body, which
we see when the inward parts are rent asunder. Others, again, have
believed the soul to be made up of very minute and individual
corpustules, which they call atoms, meeting in themselves and
cohering. Others have said that its substance is air, others fire.
Others have been of opinion that it is no substance at all, since
they could not think any substance unless it is body, and they did
not find that the soul was body; but it was in their opinion the
tempering together itself of our body, or the combining together of
the elements, by which that flesh is as it were conjoined. And
hence all of these have held the soul to be mortal; since, whether
it were body, or some combination of body, certainly it could not
in either case continue always without death. But they who have
held its substance to be some kind of life the reverse of
corporeal, since they have found it to be a life that animates and
quickens every living body, have by consequence striven also,
according as each was able, to prove it immortal, since life cannot
be without life.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.vii-p4">For as to that fifth kind of body,
I know not what, which some have added to the four well-known
elements of the world, and have said that the soul was made of
this, I do not think we need spend time in discussing it in this
place. For either they mean by body what we mean by it, <i>
viz.</i>, that of which a part is less than the whole in extension
of place, and they are to be reckoned among those who have believed
the mind to be corporeal: or if they call either all substance, or
all changeable substance, body, whereas they know that not all
substance is contained in extension of place by any length and
breadth and height, we need not contend with them about a question
of words.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.vii-p5">10. Now, in the case of all these
opinions, any one who sees that the nature of the mind is at once
substance, and yet not corporeal,&#8212;that is, that it does not
occupy a less extension of place with a less part of itself, and a
greater with a greater,&#8212;must needs see at the same time that they

concerning mind, but because they associate with it qualities
without which they are not able to conceive any nature at all. For
if you bid them conceive of existence that is without corporeal
phantasms, they hold it merely nothing. And so the mind would not
seek itself, as though wanting to itself. For what is so present to
knowledge as that which is present to the mind? Or what is so
present to the mind as the mind itself? And hence what is called
&#8220;invention,&#8221; if we consider the origin of the word, what else
does it mean, unless that to find out<note place="end" n="726" id="iv.i.xii.vii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xii.vii-p7"> <i>Invenire</i></p></note> is to &#8220;come into&#8221; that which is

they may be said to be known; since we did not endeavor by seeking
to come into them, that is to invent or find them out. And
therefore, as the mind itself really seeks those things which are
sought by the eyes or by any other sense of the body (for the mind
directs even the carnal sense, and then finds out or invents, when
that sense comes to the things which are sought); so, too, it finds
out or invents other things which it ought to know, not with the
medium of corporeal sense, but through itself, when it &#8220;comes
into&#8221; them; and this, whether in the case of the higher substance
that is in God, or of the other parts of the soul; just as it does
when it judges of bodily images themselves, for it finds these
within, in the soul, impressed through the body.</p>

Inquires into Itself. Whence Comes the Error of the Soul Concerning
Itself.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.viii-p2">11. It is then a wonderful
question, in what manner the soul seeks and finds itself; at what
it aims in order to seek, or whither it comes, that it may come
into or find out. For what is so much in the mind as the mind
itself? But because it is <i>in</i> those things which it thinks of
with love, and is wont to be in sensible, that is, in corporeal
things with love, it is unable to be in itself without the images
of those corporeal things. And hence shameful error arises to block
its way, whilst it cannot separate from itself the images of
sensible things, so as to see itself alone. For they have
marvellously cohered with it by the close adhesion of love. And
herein consists its uncleanness; since, while it strives to think
of itself alone, it fancies itself to be that, without which it
cannot think of itself. When, therefore, it is bidden to become
acquainted with itself, let it not seek itself as though it were
withdrawn from itself; but let it withdraw that which it has added
to itself. For itself lies more deeply within, not only than those
sensible things, which are clearly without, but also than the
images of them; which are indeed in some part of the soul, <i>
viz</i>., that which beasts also have, although these want
understanding, which is proper to the mind. As therefore the mind
is within, it goes forth in some sort from itself, when it exerts
the affection of love towards these, as it were, footprints of many
acts of attention. And these footprints are, as it were, imprinted
on the memory, at the time when the corporeal things which are
without are perceived in such way, that even when those corporeal
things are absent, yet the images of them are at hand to those who
think of them. Therefore let the mind become acquainted with
itself, and not seek itself as if it were absent; but fix upon
itself the act of [voluntary] attention, by which it was wandering
among other things, and let it think of itself. So it will see that
at no time did it ever not love itself, at no time did it ever not
know itself; but by loving another thing together with itself it
has confounded itself with it, and in some sense has grown one with
it. And so, while it embraces diverse things, as though they were
one, it has come to think those things to be one which are
diverse.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.ix-p2">12. Let it not therefore seek to
discern itself as though absent, but take pains to discern itself
as present. Nor let it take knowledge of itself as if it did not
know itself, but let it distinguish itself from that which it knows
to be another. For how will it take pains to obey that very precept
which is given it, &#8220;Know thyself,&#8221; if it knows not either what
&#8220;know&#8221; means or what &#8220;thyself&#8221; means? But if it knows both,
then it knows also itself. Since &#8220;know thyself&#8221; is not so said
to the mind as is &#8220;Know the cherubim and the seraphim;&#8221; for
they are absent, and we believe concerning them, and according to
that belief they are declared to be certain celestial powers. Nor
yet again as it is said, Know the will of that man: for this it is
not within our reach to perceive at all, either by sense or
understanding, unless by corporeal signs actually set forth; and
this in such a way that we rather believe than understand. Nor
again as it is said to a man, Behold thy own face; which he can
only do in a looking-glass. For even our own face itself is out of
the reach of our own seeing it; because it is not there where our
look can be directed. But when it is said to the mind, Know
thyself; then it knows itself by that very act by which it
understands the word &#8220;thyself;&#8221; and this for no other reason
than that it is present to itself. But if it does not understand
what is said, then certainly it does not do as it is bid to do. And
therefore it is bidden to do that thing which it does do, when it
understands the very precept that bids it.</p>

<div4 type="Chapter" title="Every Mind Knows Certainly Three Things Concerning Itself&#8212;That It Understands, that It Is, and that It Lives." n="10" shorttitle="Chapter 10" progress="26.35%" prev="iv.i.xii.ix" next="iv.i.xii.xi" id="iv.i.xii.x"><p class="c39" id="iv.i.xii.x-p1">

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xii.x-p1.1">Chapter 10.&#8212;Every Mind
Knows Certainly Three Things Concerning Itself&#8212;That It
Understands, that It Is, and that It Lives.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.x-p2">13. Let it not then add anything to
that which it knows itself to be, when it is bidden to know itself.
For it knows, at any rate, that this is said to itself; namely, to
the self that is, and that lives, and that understands. But a dead
body also is, and cattle live; but neither a dead body nor cattle
understand. Therefore it so knows that it so is, and that it so
lives, as an understanding is and lives. When, therefore, for
example&#8217;s sake, the mind thinks itself air, it thinks that air
understands; it knows, however, that itself understands, but it
does not know itself to be air, but only thinks so. Let it separate
that which it thinks itself; let it discern that which it knows;
let this remain to it, about which not even have they doubted who
have thought the mind to be this corporeal thing or that. For
certainly every mind does not consider 
<pb n="141" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_141.html" id="iv.i.xii.x-Page_141"/>itself to be air; but
some think themselves fire, others the brain, and some one kind of
corporeal thing, others another, as I have mentioned before; yet
all know that they themselves understand, and are, and live; but
they refer understanding to that which they understand, but to be,
and to live, to themselves. And no one doubts, either that no one
understands who does not live, or that no one lives of whom it is
not true that he is; and that therefore by consequence that which
understands both is and lives; not as a dead body is which does not
live, nor as a soul lives which does not understand, but in some
proper and more excellent manner. Further, they know that they
will, and they equally know that no one can will who is not and who
does not live; and they also refer that will itself to something
which they will with that will. They know also that they remember;
and they know at the same time that nobody could remember, unless
he both was and lived; but we refer memory itself also to
something, in that we remember those things. Therefore the
knowledge and science of many things are contained in two of these
three, memory and understanding; but will must be present, that we
may enjoy or use them. For we enjoy things known, in which things
themselves the will finds delight for their own sake, and so
reposes; but we use those things, which we refer to some other
thing which we are to enjoy. Neither is the life of man vicious and
culpable in any other way, than as wrongly using and wrongly
enjoying. But it is no place here to discuss this.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.x-p3">14. But since we treat of the
nature of the mind, let us remove from our consideration all
knowledge which is received from without, through the senses of the
body; and attend more carefully to the position which we have laid
down, that all minds know and are certain concerning themselves.
For men certainly have doubted whether the power of living, of
remembering, of understanding, of willing, of thinking, of knowing,
of judging, be of air, or of fire, or of the brain, or of the
blood, or of atoms, or besides the usual four elements of a fifth
kind of body, I know not what; or whether the combining or
tempering together of this our flesh itself has power to accomplish
these things. And one has attempted to establish this, and another
to establish that. Yet who ever doubts that he himself lives, and
remembers, and understands, and wills, and thinks, and knows, and
judges? Seeing that even if he doubts, he lives; if he doubts, he
remembers why he doubts; if he doubts, he understands that he
doubts; if he doubts, he wishes to be certain; if he doubts, he
thinks; if he doubts, he knows that he does not know; if he doubts,
he judges that he ought not to assent rashly. Whosoever therefore
doubts about anything else, ought not to doubt of all these things;
which if they were not, he would not be able to doubt of
anything.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.x-p4">15. They who think the mind to be
either a body or the combination or tempering of the body, will
have all these things to seem to be in a subject, so that the
substance is air, or fire, or some other corporeal thing, which
they think to be the mind; but that the understanding
(<i>intelligentia</i>) is in this corporeal thing as its quality,
so that this corporeal thing is the subject, but the understanding
is in the subject: <i>viz</i>. that the mind is the subject, which
they judge to be a corporeal thing, but the understanding
[intelligence], or any other of those things which we have
mentioned as certain to us, is in that subject. They also hold
nearly the same opinion who deny the mind itself to be body, but
think it to be the combination or tempering together of the body;
for there is this difference, that the former say that the mind
itself is the substance, in which the understanding [intelligence]
is, as in a subject; but the latter say that the mind itself is in
a subject, <i>viz.</i> in the body, of which it is the combination
or tempering together. And hence, by consequence, what else can
they think, except that the understanding also is in the same body
as in a subject?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.x-p5">16. And all these do not perceive
that the mind knows itself, even when it seeks for itself, as we
have already shown. But nothing is at all rightly said to be known
while its substance is not known. And therefore, when the mind
knows itself, it knows its own substance; and when it is certain
about itself, it as certain about its own substance. But it is
certain about itself, as those things which are said above prove
convincingly; although it is not at all certain whether itself is
air, or fire, or some body, or some function of body. Therefore it
is not any of these. And to that whole which is bidden to know
itself, belongs this, that it is certain that it is not any of
those things of which it is uncertain, and is certain that it is
that only, which only it is certain that it is. For it thinks in
this way of fire, or air, and whatever else of the body it thinks
of. Neither can it in any way be brought to pass that it should so
think that which itself is, as it thinks that which itself is not.
Since it thinks all these things through an imaginary phantasy,
whether fire, or air, or this or that body, or that part or
combination and tempering together of the body: nor assuredly is it
said to be all those things, but <pb n="142" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_142.html" id="iv.i.xii.x-Page_142"/>some one of them. But if it
were any one of them, it would think this one in a different manner
from the rest <i>viz</i>. not through an imaginary phantasy, as
absent things are thought, which either themselves or some of like
kind have been touched by the bodily sense; but by some inward, not
feigned, but true presence (for nothing is more present to it than
itself); just as it thinks that itself lives, and remembers, and
understands, and wills. For it knows these things in itself, and
does not imagine them as though it had touched them by the sense
outside itself, as corporeal things are touched. And if it attaches
nothing to itself from the thought of these things, so as to think
itself to be something of the kind, then whatsoever remains to it
from itself that alone is itself.</p>

Relatively.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.xi-p2">17. Putting aside, then, for a
little while all other things, of which the mind is certain
concerning itself, let us especially consider and discuss these
three&#8212;memory, understanding, will. For we may commonly discern in
these three the character of the abilities of the young also; since
the more tenaciously and easily a boy remembers, and the more
acutely he understands, and the more ardently he studies, the more
praiseworthy is he in point of ability. But when the question is
about any one&#8217;s learning, then we ask not how solidly and easily
he remembers, or how shrewdly he understands; but what it is that
he remembers, and what it is that he understands. And because the
mind is regarded as praiseworthy, not only as being learned, but
also as being good, one gives heed not only to what he remembers
and what he understands, but also to what he wills (<i>velit</i>);
not how ardently he wills, but first what it is he wills, and then
how greatly he wills it. For the mind that loves eagerly is then to
be praised, when it loves that which ought to be loved eagerly.
Since, then, we speak of these three&#8212;ability, knowledge,
use&#8212;the first of these is to be considered under the three heads,
of what a man can do in memory, and understanding, and will. The
second of them is to be considered in regard to that which any one
has in his memory and in his understanding, which he has attained
by a studious will. But the third, <i>viz</i>. use, lies in the
will, which handles those things that are contained in the memory
and understanding, whether it refer them to anything further, or
rest satisfied with them as an end. For to use, is to take up
something into the power of the will; and to enjoy, is to use with
joy, not any longer of hope, but of the actual thing. Accordingly,
every one who enjoys, uses; for he takes up something into the
power of the will, wherein he also is satisfied as with an end. But
not every one who uses, enjoys, if he has sought after that, which
he takes up into the power of the will, not on account of the thing
itself, but on account of something else.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xii.xi-p3">18. Since, then, these three,
memory, understanding, will, are not three lives, but one life; nor
three minds, but one mind; it follows certainly that neither are
they three substances, but one substance. Since memory, which is
called life, and mind, and substance, is so called in respect to
itself; but it is called memory, relatively to something. And I
should say the same also of understanding and of will, since they
are called understanding and will relatively to something; but each
in respect to itself is life, and mind, and essence. And hence
these three are one, in that they are one life, one mind, one
essence; and whatever else they are severally called in respect to
themselves, they are called also together, not plurally, but in the
singular number. But they are three, in that wherein they are
mutually referred to each other; and if they were not equal, and
this not only each to each, but also each to all, they certainly
could not mutually contain each other; for not only is each
contained by each, but also all by each. For I remember that I have
memory and understanding, and will; and I understand that I
understand, and will, and remember; and I will that I will, and
remember, and understand; and I remember together my whole memory,
and understanding, and will. For that of my memory which I do not
remember, is not in my memory; and nothing is so much in the memory
as memory itself. Therefore I remember the whole memory. Also,
whatever I understand I know that I understand, and I know that I
will whatever I will; but whatever I know I remember. Therefore I
remember the whole of my understanding, and the whole of my will.
Likewise, when I understand these three things, I understand them
together as whole. For there is none of things intelligible which I
do not understand, except what I do not know; but what I do not
know, I neither remember, nor will. Therefore, whatever of things
intelligible I do not understand, it follows also that I neither
remember nor will. And whatever of things intelligible I remember
and will, it fol<pb n="143" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_143.html" id="iv.i.xii.xi-Page_143"/>lows that I understand. My will
also embraces my whole understanding and my whole memory whilst I
use the whole that I understand and remember. And, therefore, while
all are mutually comprehended by each, and as wholes, each as a
whole is equal to each as a whole, and each as a whole at the same
time to all as wholes; and these three are one, one life, one mind,
one essence.<note place="end" n="728" id="iv.i.xii.xi-p3.1"><p id="iv.i.xii.xi-p4"> [This ternary of memory, understanding, and will, is a
better analogue to the Trinity than the preceding one in chapter
IX&#8212;namely, mind, knowledge, and love. Memory, understanding, and
will have equal substantiality, while mind, knowledge, and love
have not. The former are three <i>faculties</i>, in each of which
is the whole mind or spirit. The memory is the whole mind as
remembering; the understanding is the whole mind as cognizing; and
the will is the whole mind as determining. The one essence of the
mind is in each of these three modes, each of which is distinct
from the others; and yet there are not three essences or minds. In
the other ternary, of mind, knowledge, and love, the last two are
not faculties but single <i>acts</i> of the mind. A particular act
of cognition is not the whole mind in the <i>general</i> mode of
cognition. This would make it a faculty. A particular act of
loving, or of willing, is not the whole mind in the <i>general</i>
mode of loving, or of willing. This would make the momentary and
transient act a permanent faculty. This ternary fails, as we have
noticed in a previous annotation (IX. ii. 2), in that only the mind
is a substance.</p>

<p class="MsoEndnoteText" id="iv.i.xii.xi-p5">The ternary of
memory, understanding, and will is an adequate analogue to the
Trinity in respect to equal substantiality. But it fails when the
separate <i>consciousness</i> of the Trinitarian distinctions is
brought into consideration. The three faculties of memory,
understanding, and will, are not so objective to each other as to
admit of three forms of consciousness, of the use of the personal
pronouns, and of the personal actions that are ascribed to the
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It also fails, in that these three
are not <i>all</i> the modes of the mind. There are other
faculties: <i>e. g.</i>, the imagination. The whole essence of the
mind is in this also.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note></p>

with whatever strength of purpose we may, to that chiefest and
highest essence, of which the human mind is an inadequate image,
yet an image? Or are these same three things to be yet more
distinctly made plain in the soul, by means of those things which
we receive from without, through the bodily sense, wherein the
knowledge of corporeal things is impressed upon us in time? Since
we found the mind itself to be such in its own memory, and
understanding, and will, that since it was understood always to
know and always to will itself, it was understood also at the same
time always to remember itself, always to understand and love
itself, although not always to think of itself as <i>separate</i>
from those things which are not itself; and hence its memory of
itself, and understanding of itself, are with difficult discerned
in it. For in this case, where these two things are very closely
conjoined, and one is not preceded by the other by any time at all,
it looks as if they were not two things, but one called by two
names; and love itself is not so plainly felt to exist when the
sense of need does not disclose it, since what is loved is always
at hand. And hence these things may be more lucidly set forth, even
to men of duller minds, if such topics are treated of as are
brought within reach of the mind in time, and happen to it in time;
while it remembers what it did not remember before, and sees what
it did not see before, and loves what it did not love before. But
this discussion demands now another beginning, by reason of the
measure of the present book.</p>

which are perceived from without, viz. in the bodily object that is
seen, and in the form that is impressed by it upon the sight of the
seer, and in the purpose of the will that combines the two;
although these three are neither mutually equal, nor of one
substance. Next, a kind of trinity, in three somewhats of one
substance, is observed to exist in the mind itself, as it were
introduced there from those things that are perceived from without;
viz. the image of the bodily object which is in the memory, and the
impression formed therefrom when the mind&#8217;s eye of the thinker is
turned to it, and the purpose of the will combining both. And this
latter trinity is also said to pertain to the outer man, in that it
is introduced into the mind from bodily objects, which are
perceived from without.</p>

No</span> one doubts that, as the inner man is
endued with understanding, so is the outer with bodily sense. Let
us try, then, if we can, to discover in this outer man also, some
trace, however slight, of the Trinity, not that itself also is in
the same manner the image of God. For the opinion of the apostle is
evident, which declares the <i>inner</i> man to be renewed in the
knowledge of God after the image of Him that created him:<note place="end" n="729" id="iv.i.xiii.i-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiii.i-p3"> <scripRef passage="Col. iii. 10" id="iv.i.xiii.i-p3.2" parsed="|Col|3|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.3.10">Col. iii. 10</scripRef></p></note> whereas he

then, so far as we can, in that which perishes, some image of the
Trinity, if not so express, yet perhaps more easy to be discerned.
For that outer man also is not called man to no purpose, but
because there is in it some likeness of the inner man. And owing to
that very order of our condition whereby we are made mortal and
fleshly, we handle things visible more easily and more familiarly
than things intelligible; since the former are outward, the latter
inward; and the former are perceived by the bodily sense, the
latter are understood by the mind; and we ourselves, <i>i.e.</i>
our minds, are not sensible things, that is, bodies, but
intelligible things, since we are life. And yet, as I said, we are
so familiarly occupied with bodies, and our thought has projected
itself outwardly with so wonderful a proclivity towards bodies,
that, when it has been withdrawn from the uncertainty of things
corporeal, that it may be fixed with a much more certain and stable
knowledge in that which is spirit, it flies back to those bodies,
and seeks rest there whence it has drawn weakness. And to this its
feebleness we must suit our argument; so that, if we would endeavor
at any time to distinguish more aptly, and intimate more readily,
the inward spiritual thing, we must take examples of likenesses
from outward things pertaining to the body. The outer man, then,
endued as he is with the bodily sense, is conversant with bodies.
And this bodily sense, as is easily observed, is fivefold; seeing,
hearing, smelling, tasting, touching. But it is both a good deal of
trouble, and is not necessary, that we should inquire of all these
five senses about that which we seek. For that which one of them
declares to us, holds also good in the rest. Let us use, then,
principally the testimony of the eyes. For this bodily <pb n="145" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_145.html" id="iv.i.xiii.i-Page_145"/>sense far
surpasses the rest; and in proportion to its difference of kind, is
nearer to the sight of the mind.</p>

2.&#8212;A Certain Trinity in the Sight. That There are Three Things in
Sight, Which Differ in Their Own Nature. In What Manner from a
Visible Thing Vision is Produced, or the Image of that Thing Which
is Seen. The Matter is Shown More Clearly by an Example. How These
Three Combine in One.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.ii-p2">2. When, then, we see any corporeal
object, these three things, as is most easy to do, are to be
considered and distinguished: First, the object itself which we
see; whether a stone, or flame, or any other thing that can be seen
by the eyes; and this certainly might exist also already before it
was seen; next, vision or the act of seeing, which did not exist
before we perceived the object itself which is presented to the
sense; in the third place, that which keeps the sense of the eye in
the object seen, so long as it is seen, <i>viz</i>. the attention
of the mind. In these three, then, not only is there an evident
distinction, but also a diverse nature. For, first, that visible
body is of a far different nature from the sense of the eyes,
through the incidence of which sense upon it vision arises. And
what plainly is vision itself other than perception informed by
that thing which is perceived? Although there is no vision if the
visible object be withdrawn, nor could there be any vision of the
kind at all if there were no body that could be seen; yet the body
by which the sense of the eyes is informed, when that body is seen,
and the form itself which is imprinted by it upon the sense, which
is called vision, are by no means of the same substance. For the
body that is seen is, in its own nature, separable; but the sense,
which was already in the living subject, even before it saw what it
was able to see, when it fell in with something visible,&#8212;or the
vision which comes to be in the sense from the visible body when
now brought into connection with it and seen,&#8212;the sense, then, I
say, or the vision, that is, the sense informed from without,
belongs to the nature of the living subject, which is altogether
other than that body which we perceive by seeing, and by which the
sense is not so formed as to be sense, but as to be vision. For
unless the sense were also in us before the presentation to us of
the sensible object, we should not differ from the blind, at times
when we are seeing nothing, whether in darkness, or when our eyes
are closed. But we differ from them in this, that there is in us,
even when we are not seeing, that whereby we are able to see, which
is called the sense; whereas this is not in them, nor are they
called blind for any other reason than because they have it not.
Further also, that attention of the mind which keeps the sense in
that thing which we see, and connects both, not only differs from
that visible thing in its nature; in that the one is mind, and the
other body; but also from the sense and the vision itself: since
this attention is the act of the mind alone; but the sense of the
eyes is called a bodily sense, for no other reason than because the
eyes themselves also are members of the body; and although an
inanimate body does not perceive, yet the soul commingled with the
body perceives through a corporeal instrument, and that instrument
is called sense. And this sense, too, is cut off and extinguished
by suffering on the part of the body, when any one is blinded;
while the mind remains the same; and its attention, since the eyes
are lost, has not, indeed, the sense of the body which it may join,
by seeing, to the body without it, and so fix its look thereupon
and see it, yet by the very effort shows that, although the bodily
sense be taken away, itself can neither perish nor be diminished.
For there remains unimpaired a desire [<i>appetitus</i>] of seeing,
whether it can be carried into effect or not. These three, then,
the body that is seen, and vision itself, and the attention of mind
which joins both together, are manifestly distinguishable, not only
on account of the properties of each, but also on account of the
difference of their natures.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.ii-p3">3. And since, in this case, the
sensation does not proceed from that body which is seen, but from
the body of the living being that perceives, with which the soul is
tempered together in some wonderful way of its own; yet vision is
produced, that is, the sense itself is informed, by the body which
is seen; so that now, not only is there the power of sense, which
can exist also unimpaired even in darkness, provided the eyes are
sound, but also a sense actually informed, which is called vision.
Vision, then, is produced from a thing that is visible; but not
from that alone, unless there be present also one who sees.
Therefore vision is produced from a thing that is visible, together
with one who sees; in such way that, on the part of him who sees,
there is the sense of seeing and the intention of looking and
gazing at the object; while yet that information of the sense,
which is called vision, is imprinted only by the body which is
seen, that is, by some visible thing; which being taken away, that
form <pb n="146" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_146.html" id="iv.i.xiii.ii-Page_146"/>remains no more which was in the sense so long as that
which was seen was present: yet the sense itself remains, which
existed also before anything was perceived; just as the trace of a
thing in water remains so long as the body itself, which is
impressed on it, is in the water; but if this has been taken away,
there will no longer be any such trace, although the water remains,
which existed also before it took the form of that body. And
therefore we cannot, indeed, say that a visible thing produces the
sense; yet it produces the form, which is, as it were, its own
likeness, which comes to be in the sense, when we perceive anything
by seeing. But we do not distinguish, through the same sense, the
form of the body which we see, from the form which is produced by
it in the sense of him who sees; since the union of the two is so
close that there is no room for distinguishing them. But we
rationally infer that we could not have sensation at all, unless
some similitude of the body seen was wrought in our own sense. For
when a ring is imprinted on wax, it does not follow that no image
is produced, because we cannot discern it unless when it has been
separated. But since, after the wax is separated, what was made
remains, so that it can be seen; we are on that account easily
persuaded that there was already also in the wax a form impressed
from the ring before it was separated from it. But if the ring were
imprinted upon a fluid, no image at all would appear when it was
withdrawn; and yet none the less for this ought the reason to
discern that there was in that fluid before the ring was withdrawn
a form of the ring produced from the ring, which is to be
distinguished from that form which is in the ring, whence that form
was produced which ceases to be when the ring is withdrawn,
although that in the ring remains, whence the other was produced.
And so the [sensuous] perception of the eyes may not be supposed to
contain no image of the body, which is seen as long as it is seen,
[merely] because when that is withdrawn the image does not remain.
And hence it is very difficult to persuade men of duller mind that
an image of the visible thing is formed in our sense, when we see
it, and that this same form is vision.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.ii-p4">4. But if any perhaps attend to
what I am about to mention, they will find no such trouble in this
inquiry. Commonly, when we have looked for some little time at a
light, and then shut our eyes, there seem to play before our eyes
certain bright colors variously changing themselves, and shining
less and less until they wholly cease; and these we must understand
to be the remains of that form which was wrought in the sense,
while the shining body was seen, and that these variations take
place in them as they slowly and step by step fade away. For the
lattices, too, of windows, should we happen to be gazing at them,
appear often in these colors; so that it is evident that our sense
is affected by such impressions from that thing which is seen. That
form therefore existed also while we were seeing, and at that time
it was more clear and express. But it was then closely joined with
the species of that thing which was being perceived, so that it
could not be at all distinguished from it; and this was vision
itself. Why, even when the little flame of a lamp is in some way,
as it were, doubled by the divergent rays of the eyes, a twofold
vision comes to pass, although the thing which is seen is one. For
the same rays, as they shoot forth each from its own eye, are
affected severally, in that they are not allowed to meet evenly and
conjointly, in regarding that corporeal thing, so that one combined
view might be formed from both. And so, if we shut one eye, we
shall not see two flames, but one as it really is. But why, if we
shut the left eye, that appearance ceases to be seen, which was on
the right; and if, in turn, we shut the right eye, that drops out
of existence which was on the left, is a matter both tedious in
itself, and not necessary at all to our present subject to inquire
and discuss. For it is enough for the business in hand to consider,
that unless some image, precisely like the thing we perceive, were
produced in our sense, the appearance of the flame would not be
doubled according to the number of the eyes; since a certain way of
perceiving has been employed, which could separate the union of
rays. Certainly nothing that is really single can be seen as if it
were double by one eye, draw it down, or press, or distort it as
you please, if the other is shut.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.ii-p5">5. The case then being so, let us
remember how these three things, although diverse in nature, are
tempered together into a kind of unity; that is, the form of the
body which is seen, and the image of it impressed on the sense,
which is vision or sense informed, and the will of the mind which
applies the sense to the sensible thing, and retains the vision
itself in it. The first of these, that is, the visible thing
itself, does not belong to the nature of the living being, except
when we discern our own body. But the second belongs to that nature
to this extent, that it is wrought in the body, and through the
body in the soul; for it is wrought in the sense, which is neither
without the body nor without the soul. But the third is of the soul
alone, <pb n="147" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_147.html" id="iv.i.xiii.ii-Page_147"/>because it is the will. Although then the substances of
these three are so different, yet they coalesce into such a unity
that the two former can scarcely be distinguished, even with the
intervention of the reason as judge, namely the form of the body
which is seen, and the image of it which is wrought in the sense,
that is, vision. And the will so powerfully combines these two, as
both to apply the sense, in order to be informed, to that thing
which is perceived, and to retain it when informed in that thing.
And if it is so vehement that it can be called love, or desire, or
lust, it vehemently affects also the rest of the body of the living
being; and where a duller and harder matter does not resist,
changes it into like shape and color. One may see the little body
of a chameleon vary with ready change, according to the colors
which it sees. And in the case of other animals, since their
grossness of flesh does not easily admit change, the offspring, for
the most part, betray the particular fancies of the mothers,
whatever it is that they have beheld with special delight. For the
more tender, and so to say, the more formable, are the primary
seeds, the more effectually and capably they follow the bent of the
soul of the mother, and the phantasy that is wrought in it through
that body, which it has greedily beheld. Abundant instances might
be adduced, but one is sufficient, taken from the most trustworthy
books; <i>viz</i>. what Jacob did, that the sheep and goats might
give birth to offspring of various colors, by placing variegated
rods before them in the troughs of water for them to look at as
they drank, at the time they had conceived.<note place="end" n="731" id="iv.i.xiii.ii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiii.ii-p6"> <scripRef passage="Gen. xxx. 37-41" id="iv.i.xiii.ii-p6.2" parsed="|Gen|30|37|30|41" osisRef="Bible:Gen.30.37-Gen.30.41">Gen. xxx. 37&#8211;41</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.iii-p2">6. The rational soul, however,
lives in a degenerate fashion, when it lives according to a trinity
of the <i>outer</i> man; that is, when it applies to those things
which form the bodily sense from without, not a praiseworthy will,
by which to refer them to some useful end, but a base desire, by
which to cleave to them. Since even if the form of the body, which
was corporeally perceived, be withdrawn, its likeness remains in
the memory, to which the will may again direct its eye, so as to be
formed thence from within, as the sense was formed from without by
the presentation of the sensible body. And so that trinity is
produced from memory, from internal vision, and from the will which
unites both. And when these three things are combined into one,
from that combination<note place="end" n="732" id="iv.i.xiii.iii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiii.iii-p3"> <i>Coactus</i></p></note> itself they are called
conception.<note place="end" n="733" id="iv.i.xiii.iii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiii.iii-p4"> <i>Cogitatio</i></p></note> And in these
three there is no longer any diversity of substance. For neither is
the sensible body there, which is altogether distinct from the
nature of the living being, nor is the bodily sense there informed
so as to produce vision, nor does the will itself perform its
office of applying the sense, that is to be informed, to the
sensible body, and of retaining it in it when informed; but in
place of that bodily species which was perceived from without,
there comes the memory retaining that species which the soul has
imbibed through the bodily sense; and in place of that vision which
was outward when the sense was informed through the sensible body,
there comes a similar vision within, while the eye of the mind is
informed from that which the memory retains, and the corporeal
things that are thought of are absent; and the will itself, as
before it applied the sense yet to be informed to the corporeal
thing presented from without, and united it thereto when informed,
so now converts the vision of the recollecting mind to memory, in
order that the mental sight may be informed by that which the
memory has retained, and so there may be in the conception a like
vision. And as it was the reason that distinguished the visible
appearance by which the bodily sense was informed, from the
similitude of it, which was wrought in the sense when informed in
order to produce vision (otherwise they had been so united as to be
thought altogether one and the same); so, although that phantasy
also, which arises from the mind thinking of the appearance of a
body that it has seen, consists of the similitude of the body which
the memory retains, together with that which is thence formed in
the eye of the mind that recollects; yet it so seems to be one and
single, that it can only be discovered to be two by the judgment of
reason, by which we understand that which remains in the memory,
even when we think it from some other source, to be a different
thing from that which is brought into being when we remember, that
is, come back again to the memory, and there find the same
appearance. And if this were not now there, we should say that we
had so forgotten as to be altogether unable to recollect. And if
the eye of him who recollects were not informed from that thing
which was in the memory, the vision of the thinker could in no way
take place; but the conjunction of both, that is, of that which the
memory retains, and of that which is thence expressed so as to
inform the eye of him who recollects, makes them ap<pb n="148" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_148.html" id="iv.i.xiii.iii-Page_148"/>pear as if
they were one, because they are exceedingly like. But when the eye
of the concipient is turned away thence, and has ceased to look at
that which was perceived in the memory, then nothing of the form
that was impressed thereon will remain in that eye, and it will be
informed by that to which it had again been turned, so as to bring
about another conception. Yet that remains which it has left in the
memory, to which it may again be turned when we recollect it, and
being turned thereto may be informed by it, and become one with
that whence it is informed.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.iv-p2">7. But if that will which moves to
and fro, hither and thither, the eye that is to be informed, and
unites it when formed, shall have wholly converged to the inward
phantasy, and shall have absolutely turned the mind&#8217;s eye from
the presence of the bodies which lie around the senses, and from
the very bodily senses themselves, and shall have wholly turned it
to that image, which is perceived within; then so exact a likeness
of the bodily species expressed from the memory is presented, that
not even reason itself is permitted to discern whether the body
itself is seen without, or only something of the kind thought of
within. For men sometimes either allured or frightened by over-much
thinking of visible things, have even suddenly uttered words
accordingly, as if in real fact they were engaged in the very midst
of such actions or sufferings. And I remember some one telling me
that he was wont to perceive in thought, so distinct and as it were
solid, a form of a female body, as to be moved, as though it were a
reality. Such power has the soul over its own body, and such
influence has it in turning and changing the quality of its
[corporeal] garment; just as a man may be affected when clothed, to
whom his clothing sticks. It is the same kind of affection, too,
with which we are beguiled through imaginations in sleep. But it
makes a very great difference, whether the senses of the body are
lulled to torpor, as in the case of sleepers, or disturbed from
their inward structure, as in the case of madmen, or distracted in
some other mode, as in that of diviners or prophets; and so from
one or other of these causes, the intention of the mind is forced
by a kind of necessity upon those images which occur to it, either
from memory, or by some other hidden force through certain
spiritual commixtures of a similarly spiritual substance: or
whether, as sometimes happens to people in health and awake, that
the will occupied by thought turns itself away from the senses, and
so informs the eye of the mind by various images of sensible
things, as though those sensible things themselves were actually
perceived. But these impressions of images not only take place when
the will is directed upon such things by desiring them, but also
when, in order to avoid and guard against them, the mind is carried
away to look upon these very thing so as to <i>flee</i> from them.
And hence, not only desire, but fear, causes both the bodily eye to
be informed by the sensible things themselves, and the mental eye
(<i>acies</i>) by the images of those sensible things. Accordingly,
the more vehement has been either fear or desire, the more
distinctly is the eye informed, whether in the case of him who
[sensuously] perceives by means of the body that which lies close
to him in place, or in the case of him who conceives from the image
of the body which is contained in the memory. What then a body in
place is to the bodily sense, that, the similitude of a body in
memory is to the eye of the mind; and what the vision of one who
looks at a thing is to that appearance of the body from which the
sense is informed, that, the vision of a concipient is to the image
of the body established in the memory, from which the eye of the
mind is informed; and what the intention of the will is towards a
body seen and the vision to be combined with it, in order that a
certain unity of three things may therein take place, although
their nature is diverse, that, the same intention of the will is
towards combining the image of the body which is in the memory, and
the vision of the concipient, that is, the form which the eye of
the mind has taken in returning to the memory, in order that here
too a certain unity may take place of three things, not now
distinguished by diversity of nature, but of one and the same
substance; because this whole is within, and the whole is one
mind.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.v-p2">8. But as, when [both] the form and
species of a body have perished, the will cannot recall to it the
sense of perceiving; so, when the image which memory bears is
blotted out by forgetfulness, the will will be unable to
force <pb n="149" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_149.html" id="iv.i.xiii.v-Page_149"/>back the eye of the mind by recollection, so as to be
formed thereby. But because the mind has great power to imagine not
only things forgotten, but also things that it never saw, or
experienced, either by increasing, or diminishing, or changing, or
compounding, after its pleasure, those which have not dropped out
of its remembrance, it often imagines things to be such as either
it knows they are not, or does not know that they are. And in this
case we have to take care, lest it either speak falsely that it may
deceive, or hold an opinion so as to be deceived. And if it avoid
these two evils, then imagined phantasms do not hinder it: just as
sensible things experienced or retained by memory do not hinder it,
if they are neither passionately sought for when pleasant, nor
basely shunned when unpleasant. But when the will leaves better
things, and greedily wallows in these, then it becomes unclean; and
they are so thought of hurtfully, when they are present, and also
more hurtfully when they are absent. And he therefore lives badly
and degenerately who lives according to the trinity of the <i>
outer</i> man; because it is the purpose of using things sensible
and corporeal, that has begotten also that trinity, which although
it imagines within, yet imagines things without. For no one could
use those things even well, unless the images of things perceived
by the senses were retained in the memory. And unless the will for
the greatest part dwells in the higher and interior things, and
unless that will itself, which is accommodated either to bodies
without, or to the images of them within, refers whatever it
receives in them to a better and truer life, and rests in that end

the form which is wrought in the sense of him who sees; the form of
the bodily thing from which it is wrought, is, as it were, the
parent. But it is not a true parent; whence neither is that a true
offspring; for it is not altogether born therefrom, since something
else is applied to the bodily thing in order that it may be formed
from it, namely, the sense of him who sees. And for this reason, to

both, <i>viz</i>. the quasi-parent and the quasi-child, is more
spiritual than either of them. For that bodily thing which is
discerned, is not spiritual at all. But the vision which comes into
existence in the sense, has something spiritual mingled with it,
since it cannot come into existence without the soul. But it is not
wholly spiritual; since that which is formed is a sense of the
body. Therefore the will which unites both is confessedly more
spiritual, as I have said; and so it begins to suggest
(<i>insinuare</i>), as it were, the person of the Spirit in the
Trinity. But it belongs more to the sense that is formed, than to
the bodily thing whence it is formed. For the sense and will of an
animate being belongs to the soul, not to the stone or other bodily
thing that is seen. It does not therefore proceed from that bodily
thing as from a parent; yet neither does it proceed from that other
as it were offspring, namely, the vision and form that is in the
sense. For the will existed before the vision came to pass, which
will applied the sense that was to be formed to the bodily thing
that was to be discerned; but it was not yet satisfied. For how
could that which was not yet seen satisfy? And satisfaction means a
will that rests content. And, therefore, we can neither call the
will the quasi-offspring of vision, since it existed before vision;
nor the quasi-parent, since that vision was not formed and
expressed <pb n="150" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_150.html" id="iv.i.xiii.v-Page_150"/>from the will, but from the bodily thing that was

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.vi-p2">10. Perhaps we can rightly call
vision the end and rest of the will, only with respect to this one
object [namely, the bodily thing that is visible]. For it will not
will nothing else merely because it sees something which it is now
willing. It is not therefore the whole will itself of the man, of
which the end is nothing else than blessedness; but the will
provisionally directed to this one object, which has as its end in
seeing, nothing but vision, whether it refer the thing seen to any
other thing or not. For if it does not refer the vision to anything
further, but wills only to see this, there can be no question made
about showing that the end of the will is the vision; for it is
manifest. But if it does refer it to anything further, then
certainly it does will something else, and it will not be now a
will merely to see; or if to see, not one to see the particular
thing. Just as, if any one wished to see the scar, that from thence
he might learn that there had been a wound; or wished to see the
window, that through the window he might see the passers-by: all
these and other such acts of will have their own proper [proximate]
ends, which are referred to that [final] end of the will by which
we will to live blessedly, and to attain to that life which is not
referred to anything else, but suffices of itself to him who loves
it. The will then to see, has as its end vision; and the will to
see this particular thing, has as its end the vision of this
particular thing. Therefore the will to see the scar, desires its
own end, that is, the vision of the scar, and does not reach beyond
it; for the will to prove that there had been a wound, is a
distinct will, although dependent upon that, of which the end also
is to prove that there had been a wound. And the will to see the
window, has as its end the vision of the window; for that is
another and further will which depends upon it, <i>viz</i>. to see
the passers-by through the window, of which also the end is the
vision of the passers-by. But all the several wills that are bound
to each other, are at once right, if that one is good, to which all
are referred; and if that is bad, then all are bad. And so the
connected series of right wills is a sort of road which consists as
it were of certain steps, whereby to ascend to blessedness; but the
entanglement of depraved and distorted wills is a bond by which he
will be bound who thus acts, so as to be cast into outer
darkness.<note place="end" n="738" id="iv.i.xiii.vi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiii.vi-p3"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 22.13" id="iv.i.xiii.vi-p3.1" parsed="|Matt|22|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.13">Matt. xxii. 13</scripRef></p></note> Blessed

the will being in repose, which we call its end, if it is still
referred to something further, as if we should say that the foot is
at rest in walking, when it is placed there, whence yet another
foot may be planted in the direction of the man&#8217;s steps. But if
something so satisfies, that the will acquiesces in it with a
certain delight; it is nevertheless not yet that to which the man
ultimately tends; but this too is referred to something further, so
as to be regarded not as the native country of a citizen, but as a
place of refreshment, or even of stopping, for a

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xiii.vii-p1.1">Chapter 7.&#8212;There is Another Trinity in the Memory of
Him Who Thinks Over Again What He Has Seen.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.vii-p2">11. But yet again, take the case of
another trinity, more inward indeed than that which is in things
sensible, and in the senses, but which is yet conceived from
thence; while now it is no longer the sense of the body that is
informed from the body, but the eye of the mind that is informed
from the memory, since the species of the body which we perceived
from without has inhered in the memory itself. And that species,
which is in the memory, we call the quasi-parent of that which is
wrought in the phantasy of one who conceives. For it was in the
memory also, before we conceived it, just as the body was in place
also before we [sensuously] perceived it, in order that vision
might take place. But when it is conceived, then from that form
which the memory retains, there is copied in the mind&#8217;s eye
(<i>acie</i>) of him who conceives, and by remembrance is formed,
that species, which is the quasi-offspring of that which the memory
retains. But neither is the one a true parent, nor the other a true
offspring. For the mind&#8217;s vision which is formed from memory when
we think anything by recollection, does not proceed from that
species which we remember as seen; since we could not indeed have
remembered those things, unless we had seen them; yet the mind&#8217;s
eye, which is informed by the recollection, existed also before we
saw the body that we remember; and therefore how much more before
we committed it to memory? Although therefore the form which is
wrought in the mind&#8217;s eye of him who remembers, is wrought
<pb n="151" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_151.html" id="iv.i.xiii.vii-Page_151"/>from
that form which is in the memory; yet the mind&#8217;s eye itself does
not exist from thence, but existed before it. And it follows, that
if the one is not a true parent, neither is the other a true
offspring. But both that quasi-parent and that quasi-offspring
suggest something, whence the inner and truer things may appear
more practically and more certainly.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.vii-p3">12. Further, it is more difficult
to discern clearly, whether the will which connects the vision to
the memory is not either the parent or the offspring of some one of
them; and the likeness and equality of the same nature and
substance cause this difficulty of distinguishing. For it is not
possible to do in this case, as with the sense that is formed from
without (which is easily discerned from the sensible body, and
again the will from both), on account of the difference of nature
which is mutually in all three, and of which we have treated
sufficiently above. For although this trinity, of which we at
present speak, is introduced into the mind from without; yet it is
transacted within, and there is no part of it outside of the nature
of the mind itself. In what way, then, can it be demonstrated that
the will is neither the quasi-parent, nor the quasi-offspring,
either of the corporeal likeness which is contained in the memory,
or of that which is copied thence in recollecting; when it so
unites both in the act of conceiving, as that they appear singly as
one, and cannot be discerned except by reason? It is then first to
be considered that there cannot be any will to remember, unless we
retain in the recesses of the memory either the whole, or some
part, of that thing which we wish to remember. For the very will to
remember cannot arise in the case of a thing which we have
forgotten altogether and absolutely; since we have already
remembered that the thing which we wish to remember is or has been,
in our memory. For example, if I wish to remember what I supped on
yesterday, either I have already remembered that I did sup, or if
not yet this, at least I have remembered something about that time
itself, if nothing else; at all events, I have remembered
yesterday, and that part of yesterday in which people usually sup,
and what supping is. For if I had not remembered anything at all of
this kind, I could not wish to remember what I supped on yesterday.
Whence we may perceive that the will of remembering proceeds,
indeed, from those things which are retained in the memory, with
the addition also of those which, by the act of discerning, are
copied thence through recollection; that is, from the combination
of something which we have remembered, and of the vision which was
thence wrought, when we remembered, in the mind&#8217;s eye of him who
thinks. But the will itself which unites both requires also some
other thing, which is, as it were, close at hand, and adjacent to
him who remembers. There are, then, as many trinities of this kind
as there are remembrances; because there is no one of them wherein
there are not these three things, <i>viz</i>. that which was stored
up in the memory also before it was thought, and that which takes
place in the conception when this is discerned, and the will that
unites both, and from both and itself as a third, completes one
single thing. Or is it rather that we so recognize some one trinity
in this kind, as that we are to speak generally, of whatever
corporeal species lie hidden in the memory, as of a single unity,
and again of the general vision of the mind which remembers and
conceives such things, as of a single unity, to the combination of
which two there is to be joined as a third the will that combines
them, that this whole may be a certain unity made up from
three?</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xiii.viii-p1.1">Chapter 8.&#8212;Different Modes of Conceiving.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.viii-p2">But since the eye of the mind
cannot look at all things together, in one glance, which the memory
retains, these trinities of thought alternate in a series of
withdrawals and successions, and so that trinity becomes most
innumerably numerous; and yet not infinite, if it pass not beyond
the number of things stored up in the memory. For, although we
begin to reckon from the earliest perception which any one has of
material things through any bodily sense, and even take in also
those things which he has forgotten, yet the number would
undoubtedly be certain and determined, although innumerable. For we
not only call infinite things innumerable, but also those, which,
although finite, exceed any one&#8217;s power of reckoning.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.viii-p3">13. But we can hence perceive a
little more clearly that what the memory stores up and retains is a
different thing from that which is thence copied in the conception
of the man who remembers, although, when both are combined
together, they appear to be one and the same; because we can only
remember just as many species of bodies as we have actually seen,
and so great, and such, as we have actually seen; for the mind
imbibes them into the memory from the bodily sense; whereas the
things seen in conception, although drawn from those things which
are in the memory, yet are multiplied 
<pb n="152" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_152.html" id="iv.i.xiii.viii-Page_152"/>and varied innumerably,
and altogether without end. For I remember, no doubt, but one sun,
because according to the fact, I have seen but one; but if I
please, I conceive of two, or three, or as many as I will; but the
vision of my mind, when I conceive of many, is formed from the same
memory by which I remember one. And I remember it just as large as
I saw it. For if I remember it as larger or smaller than I saw it,
then I no longer remember what I saw, and so I do not remember it.
But because I remember it, I remember it as large as I saw it; yet
I conceive of it as greater or as less according to my will. And I
remember it as I saw it; but I conceive of it as running its course
as I will, and as standing still where I will, and as coming whence
I will, and whither I will. For it is in my power to conceive of it
as square, although I remember it as round; and again, of what
color I please, although I have never seen, and therefore do not
remember, a green sun; and as the sun, so all other things. But
owing to the corporeal and sensible nature of these forms of
things, the mind falls into error when it imagines them to exist
without, in the same mode in which it conceives them within, either
when they have already ceased to exist without, but are still
retained in the memory, or when in any other way also, that which
we remember is formed in the mind, not by faithful recollection,
but after the variations of thought.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.viii-p4">14. Yet it very often happens that
we believe also a true narrative, told us by others, of things
which the narrators have themselves perceived by their senses. And
in this case, when we conceive the things narrated to us, as we
hear them, the eye of the mind does not seem to be turned back to
the memory, in order to bring up visions in our thoughts; for we do
not conceive these things from our own recollection, but upon the
narration of another; and that trinity does not here seem to come
to its completion, which is made when the species lying hid in the
memory, and the vision of the man that remembers, are combined by
will as a third. For I do not conceive that which lay hid in my
memory, but that which I hear, when anything is narrated to me. I
am not speaking of the words themselves of the speaker, lest any
one should suppose that I have gone off to that other trinity,
which is transacted without, in sensible things, or in the senses:
but I am conceiving of those species of material things, which the
narrator signifies to me by words and sounds; which species
certainly I conceive of not by remembering, but by hearing. But if
we consider the matter more carefully, even in this case, the limit
of the memory is not overstepped. For I could not even understand
the narrator, if I did not remember generically the individual
things of which he speaks, even although I then hear them for the
first time as connected together in one tale. For he who, for
instance, describes to me some mountain stripped of timber, and
clothed with olive trees, describes it to me who remembers the
species both of mountains, and of timber, and of olive trees; and
if I had forgotten these, I should not know at all of what he was
speaking, and therefore could not conceive that description. And so
it comes to pass, that every one who conceives things corporeal,
whether he himself imagine anything, or hear, or read, either a
narrative of things past, or a foretelling of things future, has
recourse to his memory, and finds there the limit and measure of
all the forms at which he gazes in his thought. For no one can
conceive at all, either a color or a form of body, which he never
saw, or a sound which he never heard, or a flavor which he never
tasted, or a scent which he never smelt, or any touch of a
corporeal thing which he never felt. But if no one conceives
anything corporeal except what he has [sensuously] perceived,
because no one remembers anything corporeal except what he has thus
perceived, then, as is the limit of perceiving in bodies, so is the
limit of thinking in the memory. For the sense receives the species
from that body which we perceive, and the memory from the sense;
but the mental eye of the concipient, from the memory.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.viii-p5">15. Further, as the will applies
the sense to the bodily object, so it applies the memory to the
sense, and the eye of the mind of the concipient to the memory. But
that which harmonizes those things and unites them, itself also
disjoins and separates them, that is, the will. But it separates
the bodily senses from the bodies that are to be perceived, by
movement of the body, either to hinder our perceiving the thing, or
that we may cease to perceive it: as when we avert our eyes from
that which we are unwilling to see, or shut them; so, again, the
ears from sounds, or the nostrils from smells. So also we turn away
from tastes, either by shutting the mouth, or by casting the thing
out of the mouth. In touch, also, we either remove the bodily
thing, that we may not touch what we do not wish, or if we were
already touching it, we fling or push it away. Thus the will acts
by movement of the body, so that the bodily sense shall not be
joined to the sensible things. And it does this according to
its <pb n="153" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_153.html" id="iv.i.xiii.viii-Page_153"/>power; for when it endures hardship in so doing, on
account of the condition of slavish mortality, then torment is the
result, in such wise that nothing remains to the will save
endurance. But the will averts the memory from the sense; when,
through its being intent on something else, it does not suffer
things present to cleave to it. As any one may see, when often we
do not seem to ourselves to have heard some one who was speaking to
us, because we were thinking of something else. But this is a
mistake; for we did hear, but we do not remember, because the words
of the speaker presently slipped out of the perception of our ears,
through the bidding of the will being diverted elsewhere, by which
they are usually fixed in the memory. Therefore, we should say more
accurately in such a case, we do not remember, than, we did not
hear; for it happens even in reading, and to myself very
frequently, that when I have read through a page or an epistle, I
do not know what I have read, and I begin it again. For the purpose
of the will being fixed on something else, the memory was not so
applied to the bodily sense, as the sense itself was applied to the
letters. So, too, any one who walks with the will intent on
something else, does not know where he has got to; for if he had
not seen, he would not have walked thither, or would have felt his
way in walking with greater attention, especially if he was passing
through a place he did not know; yet, because he walked easily,
certainly he saw; but because the memory was not applied to the
sense itself in the same way as the sense of the eyes was applied
to the places through which he was passing, he could not remember
at all even the last thing he saw. Now, to will to turn away the
eye of the mind from that which is in the memory, is nothing else
but not to think thereupon.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.ix-p2">16. In this arrangement, then,
while we begin from the bodily species and arrive finally at the
species which comes to be in the intuition (<i>contuitu</i>) of the
concipient, we find four species born, as it were, step by step one
from the other, the second from the first, the third from the
second, the fourth from the third: since from the species of the
body itself, there arises that which comes to be in the sense of
the percipient; and from this, that which comes to be in the
memory; and from this, that which comes to be in the mind&#8217;s eye
of the concipient. And the will, therefore, thrice combines as it
were parent with offspring: first the species of the body with that
to which it gives birth in the sense of the body; and that again
with that which from it comes to be in the memory; and this also,
thirdly, with that which is born from it in the intuition of the
concipient&#8217;s mind. But the intermediate combination which is the
second, although it is nearer to the first, is yet not so like the
first as the third is. For there are two kinds of vision, the one
of [sensuous] perception (<i>sentientis</i>), the other of
conception (<i>cogitantis</i>). But in order that the vision of
conception may come to be, there is wrought for the purpose, in the
memory, from the vision of [sensuous] perception something like it,
to which the eye of the mind may turn itself in conceiving, as the
glance (<i>acies</i>) of the eyes turns itself in [sensuously]
perceiving to the bodily object. I have, therefore, chosen to put
forward two trinities in this kind: one when the vision of
[sensuous] perception is formed from the bodily object, the other
when the vision of conception is formed from the memory. But I have
refrained from commending an intermediate one; because we do not
commonly call it vision, when the form which comes to be in the
sense of him who perceives, is entrusted to the memory. Yet in all
cases the will does not appear unless as the combiner as it were of
parent and offspring; and so, proceed from whence it may, it can be
called neither parent nor offspring.<note place="end" n="741" id="iv.i.xiii.ix-p2.1"><p id="iv.i.xiii.ix-p3"> [Augustin&#8217;s map of consciousness is as follows: (1).

The mental species in its second form=remembered perception. These
three &#8220;species&#8221; or appearances of the object: namely,

already taken pains to show as much as I can to be the uniter and
the separater of things of this kind) leads the vision of the
conceiver that is to be formed, after its own will and
pleasure, <pb n="154" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_154.html" id="iv.i.xiii.x-Page_154"/>through the hidden stores of the memory; and, in order
to conceive [imagine] those things which we do not remember, impels
it to take one thing from hence, and another from thence, from
those which we do remember; and these things combining into one
vision make something which is called false, because it either does
not exist externally in the nature of corporeal things, or does not
seem copied from the memory, in that we do not remember that we
ever saw such a thing. For who ever saw a black swan? And therefore
no one remembers a black swan; yet who is there that cannot
conceive it? For it is easy to apply to that shape which we have
come to know by seeing it, a black color, which we have not the
less seen in other bodies; and because we have seen both, we
remember both. Neither do I remember a bird with four feet, because
I never saw one; but I contemplate such a phantasy very easily, by
adding to some winged shape such as I have seen, two other feet,
such as I have likewise seen.<note place="end" n="742" id="iv.i.xiii.x-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiii.x-p3"> <i>Vid. Retract</i>. 11. xv. 2. [Augustin here says that when he wrote the

conjointly, what we remember to have seen singly, we seem not to
conceive that which we remember; while we really do this under the
law of the memory, whence we take everything which we join together
after our own pleasure in manifold and diverse ways. For we do not
conceive even the very magnitudes of bodies, which magnitudes we
never saw, without help of the memory; for the measure of space to
which our gaze commonly reaches through the magnitude of the world,
is the measure also to which we enlarge the bulk of bodies,
whatever they may be, when we conceive them as great as we can. And
reason, indeed, proceeds still beyond, but phantasy does not follow
her; as when reason announces the infinity of number also, which no
vision of him who conceives according to corporeal things can
apprehend. The same reason also teaches that the most minute atoms
are infinitely divisible; yet when we have come to those slight and
minute particles which we remember to have seen, then we can no
longer behold phantasms more slender and more minute, although
reason does not cease to continue to divide them. So we conceive no
corporeal things, except either those we remember, or from those
things which we remember.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiii.xi-p2">18. But because those things which
are impressed on the memory singly, can be conceived according to
number, measure seems to belong to the memory, but number to the
vision; because, although the multiplicity of such visions is
innumerable, yet a limit not to be transgressed is prescribed for
each in the memory. Therefore, measure appears in the memory,
number in the vision of things: as there is some measure in visible
bodies themselves, to which measure the sense of those who see is
most numerously adjusted, and from one visible object is formed the
vision of many beholders, so that even a single person sees
commonly a single thing under a double appearance, on account of
the number of his two eyes, as we have laid down above. Therefore
there is some measure in those things whence visions are copied,
but in the visions themselves there is number. But the will which
unites and regulates these things, and combines them into a certain
unity, and does not quietly rest its desire of [sensuously]
perceiving or of conceiving, except in those things from whence the
visions are formed, resembles weight. And therefore I would just
notice by way of anticipation these three things, measure, number,
weight, which are to be perceived in all other things also. In the
meantime, I have now shown as much as I can, and to whom I can,
that the will is the uniter of the visible thing and of the vision;
as it were, of parent and of offspring; whether in [sensuous]
perception or in conception, and that it cannot be called either
parent or offspring. Wherefore time admonishes us to seek for this
same trinity in the inner man, and to strive to pass inwards from
that animal and carnal and (as he is called) outward man, of whom I
have so long spoken. And here we hope to be able to find an image
of God according to the Trinity, He Himself helping our efforts,
who as things themselves show, and as Holy Scripture also
witnesses, has regulated all things in measure, and number, and
weight.<note place="end" n="743" id="iv.i.xiii.xi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiii.xi-p3"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. xi. 21" id="iv.i.xiii.xi-p3.2" parsed="|Wis|11|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.11.21">Wisd. xi. 21</scripRef></p></note></p>

now, and let us see where lies, as it were, the boundary line
between the outer and inner man. For whatever we have in the mind
common with the beasts, thus much is rightly said to belong to the
outer man. For the outer man is not to be considered to be the body
only, but with the addition also of a certain peculiar life of the
body, whence the structure of the body derives its vigor, and all
the senses with which he is equipped for the perception of outward
things; and when the images of these outward things already
perceived, that have been fixed in the memory, are seen again by
recollection, it is still a matter pertaining to the outer man. And
in all these things we do not differ from the beasts, except that
in shape of body we are not prone, but upright. And we are
admonished through this, by Him who made us, not to be like the
beasts in that which is our better part&#8212;that is, the mind&#8212;while
we differ from them by the uprightness of the body. Not that we are
to throw our mind into those bodily things which are exalted; for
to seek rest for the will, even in such things, is to prostrate the
mind. But as the body is naturally raised upright to those bodily
things which are most elevated, that is, to things celestial; so
the mind, which is a spiritual substance, must be raised upright to
those things which are most elevated in spiritual things, not by
the elation of pride, but by the dutifulness of
righteousness.</p>

both to perceive things corporeal from without, through the senses
of the body, and to fix them in the memory, and remember them, and
in them to seek after things suitable, and shun things
inconvenient. But to note these things, and to retain them not only
as caught up naturally but also as deliberately committed to
memory, and to imprint them again by recollection and conception
when now just slipping away into forgetfulness; in order that as
conception is formed from that which the memory contains, so also
the contents themselves of the memory may be fixed firmly by
thought: to combine again imaginary objects of sight, by taking
this or that of what the memory remembers, and, as it were, tacking
them to one another: to examine after what manner it is that in
this kind things like the true are to be distinguished from the
true, and this not in things spiritual, but in corporeal things
themselves;&#8212;these acts, and the like, although performed in
reference to things sensible, and those which the mind has deduced
through the bodily senses, yet, as they are combined with reason,
so are not common to men and beasts. But it is the part of the
higher reason to judge of these corporeal things according to
incorporeal and eternal reasons; which, unless they were above the
human mind, would certainly not be unchangeable; and yet, unless
something of our own were subjoined to them, we should not be able
to employ them as our measures by which to judge of corporeal
things. But we judge of corporeal things from the rule of
dimensions and figures, which the mind knows to remain
unchangeably.<note place="end" n="744" id="iv.i.xiv.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.ii-p3"> [The distinction drawn here is

has to do with the handling of corporeal and temporal things, is
indeed rational, in that it is not common to us with the beasts;
but it is drawn, as it were, out of that rational substance of our
mind, by which we depend upon and cleave to the intelligible and
unchangeable truth, and which is deputed to handle and direct the
inferior things. For as among all the beasts there was not found
for the man a help like unto him, unless one were taken from
himself, and formed to be his consort: so for that mind, by which
we consult the supernal and inward truth, there is no like help for
such employment as man&#8217;s nature requires among things corporeal
out of those parts of the soul which we have in common with the
beasts. And so a certain part of our reason, not separated so as to
sever unity, but, as it were, diverted so as to be a help to
fellowship, is parted off for the performing of its proper work.
And as the twain is one flesh in the case of male and female, so in
the mind one nature embraces our intellect and action, or our
counsel and performance, or our reason and rational appetite, or

nature of the human mind, we discuss a single subject, and do not
double it into those two which I have mentioned, except in respect
to its functions. Therefore, when we seek the trinity in the mind,
we seek it in the whole mind, without separating the action of the
reason in things temporal from the contemplation of things eternal,
so as to have further to seek some third thing, by which a trinity
may be completed. But this trinity must needs be so discovered in
the whole nature of the mind, as that even if action upon temporal
things were to be withdrawn, for which work that help is necessary,
with a view to which some part of the mind is diverted in order to
deal with these inferior things, yet a trinity would still be found
in the one mind that is no where parted off; and that when this
distribution has been already made, not only a trinity may be
found, but also an image of God, in that alone which belongs to the
contemplation of eternal things; while in that other which is
diverted from it in the dealing with temporal things, although
there may be a trinity, yet there cannot be found an image of

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.v-p2">5. Accordingly they do not seem to
me to advance a probable opinion, who lay it down that a trinity of
the image of God in three persons, so far as regards human nature,
can so be discovered as to be completed in the marriage of male and
female and in their offspring; in that the man himself, as it were,
indicates the person of the Father, but that which has so proceeded
from him as to be born, that of the Son; and so the third person as
of the Spirit, is, they say, the woman, who has so proceeded from
the man as not herself to be either son or daughter,<note place="end" n="746" id="iv.i.xiv.v-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.v-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. ii. 22" id="iv.i.xiv.v-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|2|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.2.22">Gen. ii. 22</scripRef></p></note> although it
was by her conception that the offspring was born. For the Lord
hath said of the Holy Spirit that He proceedeth from the Father,<note place="end" n="747" id="iv.i.xiv.v-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.v-p4"> <scripRef passage="John xv. 26" id="iv.i.xiv.v-p4.2" parsed="|John|15|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.15.26">John xv. 26</scripRef></p></note> and yet he
is not a son. In this erroneous opinion, then, the only point
probably alleged, and indeed sufficiently shown according to the
faith of the Holy Scripture, is this,&#8212;in the account of the
original creation of the woman,&#8212;that what so comes into existence
from some person as to make another person, cannot in every case be
called a son; since the person of the woman came into existence
from the person of the man, and yet she is not called his daughter.
All the rest of this opinion is in truth so absurd, nay indeed so
false, that it is most easy to refute it. For I pass over such a
thing, as to think the Holy Spirit to be the mother of the Son of
God, and the wife of the Father; since perhaps it may be answered
that these things offend us in carnal things, because we think of
bodily conceptions and births. Although these very things
themselves are most chastely thought of by the pure, to whom all
things are pure; but to the defiled and unbelieving, of whom
<pb n="157" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_157.html" id="iv.i.xiv.v-Page_157"/>both
the mind and conscience are polluted, nothing is pure;<note place="end" n="748" id="iv.i.xiv.v-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.v-p5"> <scripRef passage="Tit. i. 15" id="iv.i.xiv.v-p5.2" parsed="|Titus|1|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Titus.1.15">Tit. i. 15</scripRef></p></note> so that even
Christ, born of a virgin according to the flesh, is a
stumbling-block to some of them. But yet in the case of those
supreme spiritual things, after the likeness of which those kinds
of the inferior creature also are made although most remotely, and
where there is nothing that can be injured and nothing corruptible,
nothing born in time, nothing formed from that which is formless,
or whatever like expressions there may be; yet they ought not to
disturb the sober prudence of any one, lest in avoiding empty
disgust he run into pernicious error. Let him accustom himself so
to find in corporeal things the traces of things spiritual, that
when he begins to ascend upwards from thence, under the guidance of
reason, in order to attain to the unchangeable truth itself through
which these things were made, he may not draw with himself to
things above what he despises in things below. For no one ever
blushed to choose for himself wisdom as a wife, because the name of
wife puts into a man&#8217;s thoughts the corruptible connection which
consists in begetting children; or because in truth wisdom itself
is a woman in sex, since it is expressed in both Greek and Latin
tongues by a word of the feminine gender.</p>

unchangeable Love, as the spouse of God the Father, existing as it
does from Him, but not as an offspring in order to beget the Word
by which all things are made; but because divine Scripture
evidently shows it to be false. For God said, &#8220;Let us make man in
our image, after our likeness;&#8221; and a little after it is said,
&#8220;So God created man in the image of God.&#8221;<note place="end" n="749" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. i. 26, 27" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|1|26|1|27" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.26-Gen.1.27">Gen. i. 26, 27</scripRef></p></note> Certainly, in that it is of the
plural number, the word &#8220;our&#8221; would not be rightly used if man
were made in the image of one person, whether of the Father, or of
the Son, or of the Holy Spirit; but because he was made in the
image of the Trinity, on that account it is said, &#8220;After our
image.&#8221; But again, lest we should think that three Gods were to
be believed in the Trinity, whereas the same Trinity is one God, it
is said, &#8220;So God created man in the image of God,&#8221; instead of
saying, &#8220;In His own image.&#8221;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p4">7. For such expressions are
customary in the Scriptures; and yet some persons, while
maintaining the Catholic faith, do not carefully attend to them, in
such wise that they think the words, &#8220;God made man in the image
of God,&#8221; to mean that the Father made man after the image of the
Son; and they thus desire to assert that the Son also is called God
in the divine Scriptures, as if there were not other most true and
clear proofs wherein the Son is called not only God, but also the
true God. For whilst they aim at explaining another difficulty in
this text, they become so entangled that they cannot extricate
themselves. For if the Father made man after the image of the Son,
so that he is not the image of the Father, but of the Son, then the
Son is unlike the Father. But if a pious faith teaches us, as it
does, that the Son is like the Father after an equality of essence,
then that which is made in the likeness of the Son must needs also
be made in the likeness of the Father. Further, if the Father made
man not in His own image, but in the image of His Son, why does He
not say, &#8220;Let us make man after Thy image and likeness,&#8221;
whereas He does say, &#8220;our;&#8221; unless it be because the image of
the Trinity was made in man, that in this way man should be the
image of the one true God, because the Trinity itself is the one
true God? Such expressions are innumerable in the Scriptures, but
it will suffice to have produced these. It is so said in the
Psalms, &#8220;Salvation belongeth unto the Lord; Thy blessing is upon

own image, yet we are not compelled to understand any other person
in the Trinity, but the one and selfsame Trinity itself, who is one
God, and after whose image man is made.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p9">8. And since the case stands thus,
if we are to accept the same image of the Trinity, as not in one,
but in three human beings, father and mother and son, then the man
was not made after the image of God before a wife was made for him,
and before they procreated a son; because there was not yet a
trinity. Will any one say there was already a trinity, because,
although not yet in their proper form, yet in their original
nature, both the woman was already in the side of the man, and the
son in the loins of his father? Why then, when Scripture had said,
&#8220;God made man after the image of God,&#8221; did it go on to say,
&#8220;God created him; male and female created He them: and God
blessed them&#8221;?<note place="end" n="754" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p10"> <scripRef passage="Gen. i. 27, 28" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p10.2" parsed="|Gen|1|27|1|28" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.27-Gen.1.28">Gen. i. 27, 28</scripRef></p></note> (Or if it is
to be so divided, &#8220;And God created man,&#8221; so that thereupon is

them;&#8221; for some have feared to say, He made him male and female,
lest something monstrous, as it were, should be understood, as are
those whom they call hermaphrodites, although even so both might be
understood not falsely in the singular number, on account of that
which is said, &#8220;Two in one flesh.&#8221;) Why then, as I began by
saying, in regard to the nature of man made after the image of God,
does Scripture specify nothing except male and female? Certainly,
in order to complete the image of the Trinity, it ought to have
added also son, although still placed in the loins of his father,
as the woman was in his side. Or was it perhaps that the woman also
had been already made, and that Scripture had combined in a short
and comprehensive statement, that of which it was going to explain
afterwards more carefully, how it was done; and that therefore a
son could not be mentioned, because no son was yet born? As if the
Holy Spirit could not have comprehended this, too, in that brief
statement, while about to narrate the birth of the son afterwards
in its own place; as it narrated afterwards in its own place, that
the woman was taken from the side of the man,<note place="end" n="755" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p10.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p11"> <scripRef passage="Gen. ii. 24, 22" id="iv.i.xiv.vi-p11.2" parsed="|Gen|2|24|0|0;|Gen|2|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.2.24 Bible:Gen.2.22">Gen. ii. 24, 22</scripRef></p></note> and yet has not omitted here to

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p2">9. We ought not therefore so to
understand that man is made in the image of the supreme Trinity,
that is, in the image of God, as that the same image should be
understood to be in three human beings; especially when the apostle
says that the man is the image of God, and on that account removes
the covering from his head, which he warns the woman to use,
speaking thus: &#8220;For a man indeed ought not to cover his head,
forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the
glory of the man.&#8221; What then shall we say to this? If the woman
fills up the image of the trinity after the measure of her own
person, why is the man still called that image after she has been
taken out of his side? Or if even one person of a human being out
of three can be called the image of God, as each person also is God
in the supreme Trinity itself, why is the woman also not the image
of God? For she is instructed for this very reason to cover her
head, which he is forbidden to do because he is the image of God.<note place="end" n="756" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 7, 5" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|11|7|0|0;|1Cor|11|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.7 Bible:1Cor.11.5">1 Cor. xi. 7, 5</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p4">10. But we must notice how that
which the apostle says, that not the woman but the man is the image
of God, is not contrary to that which is written in Genesis, &#8220;God
created man: in the image of God created He him; male and female
created He them: and He blessed them.&#8221; For this text says that
human nature itself, which is complete [only] in both sexes, was
made in the image of God; and it does not separate the woman from
the image of God which it signifies. For after <pb n="159" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_159.html" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-Page_159"/>saying that
God made man in the image of God, &#8220;He created him,&#8221; it says,
&#8220;male and female:&#8221; or at any rate, punctuating the words
otherwise, &#8220;male and female created He them.&#8221; How then did the
apostle tell us that the man is the image of God, and therefore he
is forbidden to cover his head; but that the woman is not so, and
therefore is commanded to cover hers? Unless, forsooth, according
to that which I have said already, when I was treating of the
nature of the human mind, that the woman together with her own
husband is the image of God, so that that whole substance may be
one image; but when she is referred separately to her quality of
<i>help-meet</i>, which regards the woman herself alone, then she
is not the image of God; but as regards the man alone, he is the
image of God as fully and completely as when the woman too is
joined with him in one. As we said of the nature of the human mind,
that both in the case when as a whole it contemplates the truth it
is the image of God; and in the case when anything is divided from
it, and diverted in order to the cognition of temporal things;
nevertheless on that side on which it beholds and consults truth,
here also it is the image of God, but on that side whereby it is
directed to the cognition of the lower things, it is not the image
of God. And since it is so much the more formed after the image of
God, the more it has extended itself to that which is eternal, and
is on that account not to be restrained, so as to withhold and
refrain itself from thence; therefore the man ought not to cover
his head. But because too great a progression towards inferior
things is dangerous to that rational cognition that is conversant
with things corporeal and temporal; this ought to have power on its
head, which the covering indicates, by which it is signified that
it ought to be restrained. For a holy and pious meaning is pleasing
to the holy angels.<note place="end" n="757" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 10" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p5.2" parsed="|1Cor|11|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.10">1 Cor. xi. 10</scripRef></p></note> For God sees not after the way of

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p6">11. For that the Apostle Paul, when
speaking outwardly of the sex of male and female, figured the
mystery of some more hidden truth, may be understood from this,
that when he says in another place that she is a widow indeed who
is desolate, without children and nephews, and yet that she ought
to trust in God, and to continue in prayers night and day,<note place="end" n="758" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p7"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 5" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p7.2" parsed="|1Tim|5|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.5">1 Tim. v. 5</scripRef></p></note> he here
indicates, that the woman having been brought into the
transgression by being deceived, is brought to salvation by
child-bearing; and then he has added, &#8220;If they continue in faith,

widow, if either she had not sons, or if those whom she had did not
choose to continue in good works. But because those things which
are called good works are, as it were, the sons of our life,
according to that sense of life in which it answers to the
question, What is a man&#8217;s life? that is, How does he act in these
temporal things? which life the Greeks do not call <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p8.3">&#958;&#969;&#8053;</span> but
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p8.4">&#946;&#8055;&#959;&#962;</span>; and
because these good works are chiefly performed in the way of
offices of mercy, while works of mercy are of no profit, either to
Pagans, or to Jews who do not believe in Christ, or to any heretics
or schismstics whatsoever in whom faith and charity and sober
holiness are not found: what the apostle meant to signify is plain,
and in so far figuratively and mystically, because he was speaking
of covering the head of the woman, which will remain mere empty
words, unless referred to some hidden sacrament.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p9">12. For, as not only most true
reason but also the authority of the apostle himself declares, man
was not made in the image of God according to the shape of his
body, but according to his rational mind. For the thought is a
debased and empty one, which holds God to be circumscribed and
limited by the lineaments of bodily members. But further, does not
the same blessed apostle say, &#8220;Be renewed in the spirit of your
mind, and put on the new man, which is created after God;&#8221;<note place="end" n="760" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p10"> <scripRef passage="Eph. iv. 23, 24" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p10.2" parsed="|Eph|4|23|4|24" osisRef="Bible:Eph.4.23-Eph.4.24">Eph. iv. 23, 24</scripRef></p></note> and in
another place more clearly, &#8220;Putting off the old man,&#8221; he says,

are renewed in the spirit of our mind, and he is the new man who is
renewed to the knowledge of God after the image of Him that created
him; no one can doubt, that man was made after the image of Him
that created him, not according to the body, nor indiscriminately
according to any part of the mind, but according to the rational
mind, wherein the knowledge of God can exist. And it is according
to this renewal, also, that we are made sons of God by the baptism
of Christ; and putting on the new man, certainly put on Christ
through faith. Who is there, then, <pb n="160" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_160.html" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-Page_160"/>who will hold women to be alien
from this fellowship, whereas they are fellow-heirs of grace with
us; and whereas in another place the same apostle says, &#8220;For ye
are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus; for as many
as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ: there is
neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is
neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus?&#8221;<note place="end" n="762" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p11.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p12"> <scripRef passage="Gal. iii. 26-28" id="iv.i.xiv.vii-p12.2" parsed="|Gal|3|26|3|28" osisRef="Bible:Gal.3.26-Gal.3.28">Gal. iii. 26&#8211;28</scripRef></p></note> Pray, have
faithful women then lost their bodily sex? But because they are
there renewed after the image of God, where there is no sex; man is
there made after the image of God, where there is no sex, that is,
in the spirit of his mind. Why, then, is the man on that account
not bound to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of
God, while the woman is bound to do so, because she is the glory of
the man; as though the woman were not renewed in the spirit of her
mind, which spirit is renewed to the knowledge of God after the
image of Him who created him? But because she differs from the man
in bodily sex, it was possible rightly to represent under her
bodily covering that part of the reason which is diverted to the
government of temporal things; so that the image of God may remain
on that side of the mind of man on which it cleaves to the
beholding or the consulting of the eternal reasons of things; and
this, it is clear, not men only, but also women have.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p2">17. Let us now complete, so far as
the Lord helps us, the discussion which we have undertaken,
respecting that part of reason to which knowledge belongs, that is,
the cognizance of things temporal and changeable, which is
necessary for managing the affairs of this life. For as in the case
of that visible wedlock of the two human beings who were made
first, the serpent did not eat of the forbidden tree, but only
persuaded them to eat of it; and the woman did not eat alone, but
gave to her husband, and they eat together; although she alone
spoke with the serpent, and she alone was led away by him:<note place="end" n="775" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 1-6" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|3|1|3|6" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.1-Gen.3.6">Gen. iii. 1&#8211;6</scripRef></p></note> so also in
the case of that hidden and secret kind of wedlock, which is
transacted and discerned in a single human being, the carnal, or as
I may say, since it is directed to the senses of the body, the
sensuous movement of the soul, which is common to us with beasts,
is shut off from the reason of wisdom. For certainly bodily things
are perceived by the sense of the body; but spiritual things, which
are eternal and unchangeable, are understood by the reason of
wisdom. But the reason of knowledge has appetite very near to it:
seeing that what is called the science or knowledge of actions
reasons concerning the bodily things which are perceived by the
bodily sense; if well, in order that it may refer that knowledge to
the end of the chief good; but if ill, in order that it may enjoy
them as being such good things as those wherein it reposes with a
false blessedness. Whenever, then, that carnal or animal sense
introduces into this purpose of the mind which is conversant about
things temporal and corporeal, <pb n="162" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_162.html" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-Page_162"/>with a view to the offices of a
man&#8217;s actions, by the living force of reason, some inducement to
enjoy itself, that is, to enjoy itself as if it were some private
good of its own, not as the public and common, which is the
unchangeable, good; then, as it were, the serpent discourses with
the woman. And to consent to this allurement, is to eat of the
forbidden tree. But if that consent is satisfied by the pleasure of
thought alone, but the members are so restrained by the authority
of higher counsel that they are not yielded as instruments of
unrighteousness unto sin;<note place="end" n="776" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Rom. vi. 13" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p4.2" parsed="|Rom|6|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.6.13">Rom. vi. 13</scripRef></p></note> this, I think, is to be considered
as if the woman alone should have eaten the forbidden food. But if,
in this consent to use wickedly the things which are perceived
through the senses of the body, any sin at all is so determined
upon, that if there is the power it is also fulfilled by the body;
then that woman must be understood to have given the unlawful food
to her husband with her, to be eaten together. For it is not
possible for the mind to determine that a sin is not only to be
thought of with pleasure, but also to be effectually committed,
unless also that intention of the mind yields, and serves the bad
action, with which rests the chief power of applying the members to
an outward act, or of restraining them from one.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p5">18. And yet, certainly, when the
mind is pleased in thought alone with unlawful things, while not
indeed determining that they are to be done, but yet holding and
pondering gladly things which ought to have been rejected the very
moment they touched the mind, it cannot be denied to be a sin, but
far less than if it were also determined to accomplished it in
outward act. And therefore pardon must be sought for such thoughts
too, and the breast must be smitten, and it must be said,
&#8220;Forgive us our debts;&#8221; and what follows must be done, and must
be joined in our prayer, &#8220;As we also forgive our debtors.&#8221;<note place="end" n="777" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p6"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 6.12" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p6.1" parsed="|Matt|6|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.12">Matt. vi. 12</scripRef></p></note> For it is
not as it was with those two first human beings, of which each one
bare his own person; and so, if the woman alone had eaten the
forbidden food, she certainly alone would have been smitten with
the punishment of death: it cannot, I say, be so said also in the
case of a single human being now, that if the thought, remaining
alone, be gladly fed with unlawful pleasures, from which it ought
to turn away directly, while yet there is no determination that the
bad actions are to be done, but only that they are retained with
pleasure in remembrance, the woman as it were can be condemned
without the man. Far be it from us to believe this. For here is one
person, one human being, and he as a whole will be condemned,
unless those things which, as lacking the will to do, and yet
having the will to please the mind with them, are perceived to be
sins of thought alone, are pardoned through the grace of the
Mediator.<note place="end" n="778" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p6.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.xii-p7"> [Augustin here teaches that the

some who before us were eminent defenders of the Catholic faith and
expounders of the word of God, while they looked for these two
things in one human being, whose entire soul they perceived to be a

that the woman was the bodily sense. And according to this
distribution, by which the man is assumed to be the mind, but the
woman the bodily sense, all things seem aptly to agree together if
they are handled with due attention: unless that it is written,
that in all the beasts and flying things there was not found for
man an helpmate like to himself; and then the woman was made out of
his side.<note place="end" n="780" id="iv.i.xiv.xiii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.xiii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. ii. 20-22" id="iv.i.xiv.xiii-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|2|20|2|22" osisRef="Bible:Gen.2.20-Gen.2.22">Gen. ii. 20&#8211;22</scripRef></p></note> And on this

received in this, or that, or in any other way; yet it is clear,
that when we live according to God, our mind which is intent on the

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-p4">22. Yet action, by which we use
temporal things well, differs from contemplation of eternal things;
and the latter is reckoned to wisdom, the former to knowledge. For
although that which is wisdom can also be called knowledge, as the
apostle too speaks, where he says, &#8220;Now I know in part, but then
shall I know even as also I am known;&#8221;<note place="end" n="786" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiii. 12" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-p5.2" parsed="|1Cor|13|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.12">1 Cor. xiii. 12</scripRef></p></note> when doubtless he meant his words
to be understood of the knowledge of the contemplation of God,

doubt these two things, although he does not there explain the
difference, nor in what way one may be discerned from the other.
But having examined a great number of passages from the Holy
Scriptures, I find it written in the Book of Job, that holy man
being the speaker, &#8220;Behold, piety, that is wisdom; but to depart
from evil is knowledge.&#8221;<note place="end" n="788" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-p7"> <scripRef passage="Job 28.28" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-p7.1" parsed="|Job|28|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.28.28">Job xxviii. 28</scripRef></p></note> In thus distinguishing, it must be
understood that wisdom belongs to contemplation, knowledge to
action. For in this place he meant by piety the worship of God,
which in Greek is called 
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-p7.2">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#963;&#8051;&#946;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span>. For the sentence
in the Greek <span class="c19" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-p7.3">mss.</span> has that word. And what
is there in eternal things more excellent than God, of whom alone
the nature is unchangeable? And what is the worship of Him except
the love of Him, by which we now desire to see Him, and we believe
and hope that we shall see Him; and in proportion as we make
progress, see now through a glass in an enigma, but then in
clearness? For this is what the Apostle Paul means by &#8220;face to
face.&#8221;<note place="end" n="789" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-p7.4"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-p8"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiii. 12" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-p8.2" parsed="|1Cor|13|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.12">1 Cor. xiii. 12</scripRef></p></note> This is also
what John says, &#8220;Beloved, now we are the sons of God, and it doth
not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that, when He shall
appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.&#8221;<note place="end" n="790" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-p9"> <scripRef passage="1 John iii. 2" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-p9.2" parsed="|1John|3|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.3.2">1 John iii. 2</scripRef></p></note> Discourse
about these and the like subjects seems to me to be the discourse
itself of wisdom. But to depart from evil, which Job says is
knowledge, is without doubt of temporal things. Since it is in
reference to time [and this world] that we are in evil, from which
we ought to abstain that we may come to those good eternal things.
And therefore, whatsoever we do prudently, boldly, temperately, and
justly, belongs to that knowledge or discipline wherewith our
action is conversant in avoiding evil and desiring good; and so
also, whatsoever we gather by the knowledge that comes from
inquiry, in the way of examples either to be guarded against or to
be imitated, and in the way of necessary proofs respecting any
subject, accommodated to our use.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-p10">23. When a discourse then relates
to these things, I hold it to be a discourse belonging to
knowledge, and to be distinguished from a discourse belonging to
wisdom, to which those things belong, which neither have
been, <pb n="164" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_164.html" id="iv.i.xiv.xiv-Page_164"/>nor shall be, but are; and on account of that eternity
in which they are, are said to have been, and to be, and to be
about to be, without any changeableness of times. For neither have
they been in such way as that they should cease to be, nor are they
about to be in such way as if they were not now; but they have
always had and always will have that very absolute being. And they
abide, but not as if fixed in some place as are bodies; but as
intelligible things in incorporeal nature, they are so at hand to
the glance of the mind, as things visible or tangible in place are
to the sense of the body. And not only in the case of sensible
things posited in place, there abide also intelligible and
incorporeal reasons of them apart from local space; but also of
motions that pass by in successive times, apart from any transit in
time, there stand also like reasons, themselves certainly
intelligible, and not sensible. And to attain to these with the eye
of the mind is the lot of few; and when they are attained as much
as they can be, he himself who attains to them does not abide in
them, but is as it were repelled by the rebounding of the eye
itself of the mind, and so there comes to be a transitory thought
of a thing not transitory. And yet this transient thought is
committed to the memory through the instructions by which the mind
is taught; that the mind which is compelled to pass from thence,
may be able to return thither again; although, if the thought
should not return to the memory and find there what it had
committed to it, it would be led thereto like an uninstructed
person, as it had been led before, and would find it where it had
first found it, that is to say, in that incorporeal truth, whence
yet once more it may be as it were written down and fixed in the
mind. For the thought of man, for example, does not so abide in
that incorporeal and unchangeable reason of a square body, as that
reason itself abides: if, to be sure, it could attain to it at all
without the phantasy of local space. Or if one were to apprehend
the rhythm of any artificial or musical sound, passing through
certain intervals of time, as it rested without time in some secret
and deep silence, it could at least be thought as long as that song
could be heard; yet what the glance of the mind, transient though
it was, caught from thence, and, absorbing as it were into a belly,
so laid up in the memory, over this it will be able to rumiuate in
some measure by recollection, and to transfer what it has thus
learned into systematic knowledge. But if this has been blotted out
by absolute forgetfulness, yet once again, under the guidance of
teaching, one will come to that which had altogether dropped away,
and it will be found such as it was.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.xv-p2">24. And hence that noble
philosopher Plato endeavored to persuade us that the souls of men
lived even before they bare these bodies; and that hence those
things which are learnt are rather remembered, as having been known
already, than taken into knowledge as things new. For he has told
us that a boy, when questioned I know not what respecting geometry,
replied as if he were perfectly skilled in that branch of learning.
For being questioned step by step and skillfully, he saw what was
to be seen, and said that which he saw.<note place="end" n="791" id="iv.i.xiv.xv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xiv.xv-p3"> [This fine specimen of the
&#8220;obstetric method&#8221; of Socrates is given in Plato&#8217;s dialogue,
Meno.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> But if this had been a recollecting
of things previously known, then certainly every one, or almost
every one, would not have been able so to answer when questioned.
For not every one was a geometrician in the former life, since
geometricians are so few among men that scarcely one can be found
anywhere. But we ought rather to believe, that the intellectual
mind is so formed in its nature as to see those things, which by
the disposition of the Creator are subjoined to things intelligible
in a natural order, by a sort of incorporeal light of an unique
kind; as the eye of the flesh sees things adjacent to itself in
this bodily light, of which light it is made to be receptive, and
adapted to it. For none the more does this fleshly eye, too,
distinguish black things from white without a teacher, because it
had already known them before it was created in this flesh. Why,
lastly, is it possible only in intelligible things that any one
properly questioned should answer according to any branch of
learning, although ignorant of it? Why can no one do this with
things sensible, except those which he has seen in this his present
body, or has believed the information of others who knew them,
whether somebody&#8217;s writings or words? For we must not acquiesce
in their story, who assert that the Samian Pythagoras recollected
some things of this kind, which he had experienced when he was
previously here in another body; and others tell yet of others,
that they experienced something of the same <pb n="165" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_165.html" id="iv.i.xiv.xv-Page_165"/>sort in
their minds: but it may be conjectured that these were untrue
recollections, such as we commonly experience in sleep, when we
fancy we remember, as though we had done or seen it, what we never
did or saw at all; and that the minds of these persons, even though
awake, were affected in this way at the suggestion of malignant and
deceitful spirits, whose care it is to confirm or to sow some false
belief concerning the changes of souls, in order to deceive men.
This, I say, may be conjectured from this, that if they really
remembered those things which they had seen here before, while
occupying other bodies, the same thing would happen to many, nay to
almost all; since they suppose that as the dead from the living,
so, without cessation and continually, the living are coming into
existence from the dead; as sleepers from those that are awake, and
those that are awake from them that sleep.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xiv.xv-p4">25. If therefore this is the right
distinction between wisdom and knowledge, that the intellectual
cognizance of eternal things belongs to wisdom, but the rational
cognizance of temporal things to knowledge, it is not difficult to
judge which is to be preferred or postponed to which. But if we
must employ some other distinction by which to know these two
apart, which without doubt the apostle teaches us are different,
saying, &#8220;To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to
another the word of knowledge, by the same Spirit:&#8221; still the
difference between those two which we have laid down is a most
evident one, in that the intellectual cognizance of eternal things
is one thing, the rational cognizance of temporal things another;
and no one doubts but that the former is to be preferred to the
latter. As then we leave behind those things which belong to the
outer man, and desire to ascend within from those things which we
have in common with beasts, before we come to the cognizance of
things intelligible and supreme, which are eternal, the rational
cognizance of temporal things presents itself. Let us then find a
trinity in this also, if we can, as we found one in the senses of
the body, and in those things which through them entered in the way
of images into our soul or spirit; so that instead of corporeal
things which we touch by corporeal sense, placed as they are
without us, we might have resemblances of bodies impressed within
on the memory from which thought might be formed, while the will as
a third united them; just as the sight of the eyes was formed from
without, which the will applied to the visible thing in order to
produce vision, and united both, while itself also added itself
thereto as a third. But this subject must not be compressed into
this book; so that in that which follows, if God help, it may be
suitably examined, and the conclusions to which we come may be
unfolded.</p>

<p class="c38" id="iv.i.xv-p3">The inquiry is prosecuted
respecting knowledge, in which, as distinguished from wisdom,
Augustin had begun in the former book to look for a kind of
trinity. And occasion is taken of commending Christian faith, and
of explaining how the faith of believers is one and common. Next,
that all desire blessedness, yet that all have not the faith
whereby we arrive at blessedness; and that this faith is defined in
Christ, who in the flesh rose from the dead; and that no one is set
free from the dominion of the devil through forgiveness of sins,
save through Him. It is shown also at length that it was needful
that the devil should be conquered by Christ, not by power, but by
righteousness. Finally, that when the words of this faith are
committed to memory, there is in the mind a kind of trinity, since
there are, first, in the memory the sounds of the words, and this
even when the man is not thinking of them; and next, the mind&#8217;s
eye of his recollection is formed thereupon when he thinks of them;
and, lastly, the will, when he so thinks and remembers, combines
both.</p>

book before this, <i>viz</i>. the twelfth of this work, we have
done enough to distinguish the office of the rational mind in
temporal things, wherein not only our knowing but our action is
concerned, from the more excellent office of the same mind, which
is employed in contemplating eternal things, and is limited to
knowing alone. But I think it more convenient that I should insert
somewhat out of the Holy Scriptures, by which the two may more
easily be distinguished.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.i-p3">2. John the Evangelist has thus
begun his Gospel: &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning
with God. All things were made by Him; and without Him was not
anything made that was made. In Him was life; and the life was the
light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness
comprehended it not. There was a man sent from God, whose name was
John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light,
that all men through Him might believe. He was not that Light, but
was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the true Light,
which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the
world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not.
He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. But as many as
received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even
to them that believe on His name: which were born, not of blood,
nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld His
glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father), full of
grace and truth.&#8221;<note place="end" n="792" id="iv.i.xv.i-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.i-p4"> <scripRef passage="John i. 1-14" id="iv.i.xv.i-p4.2" parsed="|John|1|1|1|14" osisRef="Bible:John.1.1-John.1.14">John i. 1&#8211;14</scripRef></p></note> This entire passage, which I
have <pb n="167" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_167.html" id="iv.i.xv.i-Page_167"/>here taken from the Gospel, contains in its earlier
portions what is immutable and eternal, the contemplation of which
makes us blessed; but in those which follow, eternal things are
mentioned in conjunction with temporal things. And hence some
things there belong to knowledge, some to wisdom, according to our
previous distinction in the twelfth book. For the words,&#8212;&#8220;In
the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were
made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made.
In Him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light
shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it
not:&#8221;&#8212;require a contemplative life, and must be discerned by
the intellectual mind; and the more any one has profited in this,
the wiser without doubt will he become. But on account of the
verse, &#8220;The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness
comprehended it not,&#8221; faith certainly was necessary, whereby that
which was not seen might be believed. For by &#8220;darkness&#8221; he
intended to signify the hearts of mortals turned away from light of
this kind, and hardly able to behold it; for which reason he
subjoins, &#8220;There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all
men through Him might believe.&#8221; But here we come to a thing that
was done in time, and belongs to knowledge, which is comprised in
the cognizance of facts. And we think of the man John under that
phantasy which is impressed on our memory from the notion of human
nature. And whether men believe or not, they think this in the same
manner. For both alike know what man is, the outer part of whom,
that is, his body, they have learned through the eyes of the body;
but of the inner, that is, the soul, they possess the knowledge in
themselves, because they also themselves are men, and through
intercourse with men; so that they are able to think what is said,
&#8220;There was a man, whose name was John,&#8221; because they know the
names also by interchange of speech. But that which is there also,
<i>viz</i>. &#8220;sent from God,&#8221; they who hold at all, hold by
faith; and they who do not hold it by faith, either hesitate
through doubt, or deride it through unbelief. Yet both, if they are
not in the number of those over-foolish ones, who say in their
heart &#8220;There is no God,&#8221;<note place="end" n="793" id="iv.i.xv.i-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.i-p5"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xiv. 1" id="iv.i.xv.i-p5.2" parsed="|Ps|14|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.14.1">Ps. xiv. 1</scripRef></p></note> when they hear these words, think
both things, <i>viz</i>. both what God is, and what it is to be
sent from God; and if they do not do this as the things themselves
really are, they do it at any rate as they can.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.i-p6">3. Further, we know from other
sources the faith itself which a man sees to be in his own heart,
if he believes, or not to be there, if he does not believe: but not
as we know bodies, which we see with the bodily eyes, and think of
even when absent through the images of themselves which we retain
in memory; nor yet as those things which we have not seen, and
which we frame howsoever we can in thought from those which we have
seen, and commit them to memory, that we may recur to them when we
will, in order that therein we may similarly by recollection
discern them, or rather discern the images of them, of what sort
soever these are which we have fixed there; nor again as a living
man, whose soul we do not indeed see, but conjecture from our own,
and from corporeal motions gaze also in thought upon the living
man, as we have learnt him by sight. Faith is not so seen in the
heart in which it is, by him whose it is; but most certain
knowledge holds it fast, and conscience proclaims it. Although
therefore we are bidden to believe on this account, because we
cannot see what we are bidden to believe; nevertheless we see faith
itself in ourselves, when that faith is in us; because faith even
in absent things is present, and faith in things which are without
us is within, and faith in things which are not seen is itself
seen, and itself none the less comes into the hearts of men in
time; and if any cease to be faithful and become unbelievers, then
it perishes from them. And sometimes faith is accommodated even to
falsehoods; for we sometimes so speak as to say, I put faith in
him, and he deceived me. And this kind of faith, if indeed it too
is to be called faith, perishes from the heart without blame, when
truth is found and expels it. But faith in things that are true,
passes, as one should wish it to pass, into the things themselves.
For we must not say that faith perishes, when those things which
were believed are seen. For is it indeed still to be called faith,
when faith, according to the definition in the Epistle to the
Hebrews, is the evidence of things not seen?<note place="end" n="794" id="iv.i.xv.i-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.i-p7"> <scripRef passage="Heb. xi. 1" id="iv.i.xv.i-p7.2" parsed="|Heb|11|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.11.1">Heb. xi. 1</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.i-p8">4. In the words which follow next,
&#8220;The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that
all men through him might believe;&#8221; the action, as we have said,
is one done in time. For to bear witness even to that which is
eternal, as is that light that is intelligible, is a thing done in
time. And <pb n="168" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_168.html" id="iv.i.xv.i-Page_168"/>of this it was that John came to bear witness who &#8220;was
not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.&#8221; For
he adds &#8220;That was the true Light that lighteth every man that
cometh into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made
by Him, and the world knew Him not. He came unto His own, and His
own received Him not.&#8221; Now they who know the Latin language,
understand all these words, from those things which they know: and
of these, some have become known to us through the senses of the
body, as man, as the world itself, of which the greatness is so
evident to our sight; as again the sounds of the words themselves,
for hearing also is a sense of the body; and some through the
reason of the mind, as that which is said, &#8220;And His own received
Him not;&#8221; for this means, that they did not believe in Him; and
what belief is, we do not know by any sense of the body, but by the
reason of the mind. We have learned, too, not the sounds, but the
meanings of the words themselves, partly through the sense of the
body, partly through the reason of the mind. Nor have we now heard
those words for the first time, but they are words we had heard
before. And we were retaining in our memory as things known, and we
here recognized, not only the words themselves, but also what they
meant. For when the bisyllabic word <i>mundus</i> is uttered, then
something that is certainly corporeal, for it is a sound, has
become known through the body, that is, through the ear. But that
which it means also, has become known through the body, that is,
through the eyes of the flesh. For so far as the world is known to
us at all, it is known through sight. But the quadri-syllabic word
<i>crediderunt</i> reaches us, so far as its sound, since that is a
corporeal thing, through the ear of the flesh; but its meaning is
discoverable by no sense of the body, but by the reason of the
mind. For unless we knew through the mind what the word <i>
crediderunt</i> meant, we should not understand what they did not
do, of whom it is said, &#8220;And His own received Him not.&#8221; The
sound then of the word rings upon the ears of the body from
without, and reaches the sense which is called hearing. The species
also of man is both known to us in ourselves, and is presented to
the senses of the body from without, in other men; to the eyes,
when it is seen; to the ears, when it is heard; to the touch, when
it is held and touched; and it has, too, its image in our memory,
incorporeal indeed, but like the body. Lastly, the wonderful beauty
of the world itself is at hand from without, both to our gaze, and
to that sense which is called touch, if we come in contact with any
of it: and this also has its image within in our memory, to which
we revert, when we think of it either in the enclosure of a room,
or again in darkness. But we have already sufficiently spoken in
the eleventh book of these images of corporeal things; incorporeal
indeed, yet having the likeness of bodies, and belonging to the
life of the outer man. But we are treating now of the inner man,
and of his knowledge, namely, that knowledge which is of things
temporal and changeable; into the purpose and scope of which, when
anything is assumed, even of things belonging to the outer man, it
must be assumed for this end, that something may thence be taught
which may help rational knowledge. And hence the rational use of
those things which we have in common with irrational animals
belongs to the inner man; neither can it rightly be said that this
is common to us with the irrational animals.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.ii-p2">5. But faith, of which we are
compelled, by reason of the arrangement of our subject, to dispute
somewhat more at length in this book: faith I say, which they who
have are called the faithful, and they who have not, unbelievers,
as were those who did not receive the Son of God coming to His own;
although it is wrought in us by hearing, yet does not belong to
that sense of the body which is called hearing, since it is not a
sound; nor to the eyes of this our flesh, since it is neither color
nor bodily form; nor to that which is called touch, since it has
nothing of bulk; nor to any sense of the body at all, since it is a
thing of the heart, not of the body; nor is it without apart from
us, but deeply seated within us; nor does any man see it in
another, but each one in himself. Lastly, it is a thing that can
both be feigned by pretence, and be thought to be in him in whom it
is not. Therefore every one sees his own faith in himself; but does
not see, but believes, that it is in another; and believes this the
more firmly, the more he knows the fruits of it, which faith is
wont to work by love.<note place="end" n="795" id="iv.i.xv.ii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.ii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gal. v. 6" id="iv.i.xv.ii-p3.2" parsed="|Gal|5|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.5.6">Gal. v. 6</scripRef></p></note> And therefore this faith is common
to all of whom the evangelist subjoins, &#8220;But as many as received

of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God;&#8221;
common I say, not as any form of a bodily object is common, as
regards sight, to the eyes of all to whom it is present, for in
some way the gaze of all that behold it is informed by the same one
form; but as the human countenance can be said to be common to all
men; for this is so said that yet each certainly has his own. We
say certainly with perfect truth, that the faith of believers is
impressed from one doctrine upon the heart of each several person
who believes the same thing. But that which is believed is a
different thing from the faith by which it is believed. For the
former is in things which are said either to be, or to have been or
to be about to be; but the latter is in the mind of the believer,
and is visible to him only whose it is; although not indeed itself
but a faith like it, is also in others. For it is not one in
number, but in kind; yet on account of the likeness, and the
absence of all difference, we rather call it one than many. For
when, too, we see two men exceedingly alike, we wonder, and say
that both have one countenance. It is therefore more easily said
that the souls were many,&#8212;a several soul, of course, for each
several person&#8212;of whom we read in the Acts of the Apostles, that
they were of one soul,<note place="end" n="796" id="iv.i.xv.ii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.ii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Acts iv. 32" id="iv.i.xv.ii-p4.2" parsed="|Acts|4|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.4.32">Acts iv. 32</scripRef></p></note>&#8212;than it is, where the apostle

faith. But the like faith of believers is said to be one, in the
same way as a like will of those who will is said to be one; since
in the case also of those who have the same will, the will of each
is visible to himself, but that of the other is not visible,
although he wills the same thing; and if it intimate itself by any
signs, it is believed rather than seen. But each being conscious of
his own mind certainly does not believe, but manifestly sees
outright, that this is his own will.</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xv.iii-p1.1">Chapter
3.&#8212;Some Desires Being the Same in All, are Known to Each. The
Poet Ennius.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.iii-p2">6. There is, indeed, so closely
conspiring a harmony in the same nature living and using reason,
that although one knows not what the other wills, yet there are
some wills of all which are also known to each; and although each
man does not know what any other one man wills, yet in some things
he may know what all will. And hence comes that story of the comic
actor&#8217;s witty joke, who promised that he would say in the
theatre, in some other play, what all had in their minds, and what
all willed; and when a still greater crowd had come together on the
day appointed, with great expectation, all being in suspense and
silent, is affirmed to have said: You will to buy cheap, and sell
dear. And mean actor though he was, yet all in his words recognized
what themselves were conscious of, and applauded him with wonderful
goodwill, for saying before the eyes of all what was confessedly
true, yet what no one looked for. And why was so great expectation
raised by his promising that he would say what was the will of all,
unless because no man knows the wills of other men? But did not he
know that will? Is there any one who does not know it? Yet why,
unless because there are some things which not unfitly each
conjectures from himself to be in others, through sympathy or
agreement either in vice or virtue? But it is one thing to see
one&#8217;s own will; another to conjecture, however certainly, what is
another&#8217;s. For, in human affairs, I am as certain that Rome was
built as that Constantinople was, although I have seen Rome with my
eyes, but know nothing of the other city, except what I have
believed on the testimony of others. And truly that comic actor
believed it to be common to all to will to buy cheap and sell dear,
either by observing himself or by making experiment also of others.
But since such a will is in truth a fault, every one can attain the
counter virtue, or run into the mischief of some other fault which
is contrary to it, whereby to resist and conquer it. For I myself
know a case where a manuscript was offered to a man for purchase,
who perceived that the vendor was ignorant of its value, and was
therefore asking something very small, and who thereupon gave him,
though not expecting it, the just price, which was much more.
Suppose even the case of a man possessed with wickedness so great
as to sell cheap what his parents left to him, and to buy dear, in
order to waste it on his own lusts? Such wanton extravagance, I
fancy, is not incredible; and if such men are sought, they may be
found, or even fall in one&#8217;s way although not sought; who, by a
wickedness more than that of the theatre, make a mock of the
theatrical proposition or declaration, by buying dishonor at a
great price, while selling lands at a small one. We have heard,
too, of persons that, for the sake of distribution, have bought
corn at a higher <pb n="170" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_170.html" id="iv.i.xv.iii-Page_170"/>price, and sold it to their
fellow-citizens at a lower one. And note also what the old poet
Ennius has said: that &#8220;all mortals wish themselves to be
praised;&#8221; wherein, doubtless, he conjectured what was in others,
both by himself, and by those whom he knew by experience; and so
seems to have declared what it is that all men will. Lastly, if
that comic actor himself, too, had said, You all will to be
praised, no one of you wills to be abused; he would have seemed in
like manner to have expressed what all will. Yet there are some who
hate their own faults, and do not desire to be praised by others
for that for which they are displeased with themselves; and who
thank the kindness of those who rebuke them, when the purpose of
that rebuke is their own amendment. But if he had said, You all
will to be blessed, you do not will to be wretched; he would have
said something which there is no one that would not recognize in
his own will. For whatever else a man may will secretly, he does
not withdraw from that will, which is well known to all men, and
well known to be in all men.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.iv-p2">7. It is wonderful, however, since
the will to obtain and retain blessedness is one in all, whence
comes, on the other hand, such a variety and diversity of wills
concerning that blessedness itself; not that any one is unwilling
to have it, but that all do not know it. For if all knew it, it
would not be thought by some to be in goodness of mind; by others,
in pleasure of body; by others, in both; and by some in one thing,
by others in another. For as men find special delight in this thing
or that, so have they placed in it their idea of a blessed life.
How, then, do all love so warmly what not all know? Who can love
what he does not know?&#8212;a subject which I have already discussed
in the preceding books.<note place="end" n="800" id="iv.i.xv.iv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.iv-p3"> Bks. viii. c. 4, etc., x. c.

loved by all, when it is not known by all? Is it perhaps that all

the business was about some place in this world, where every one
ought to will to live who wills to live blessedly; and as if the
question where blessedness is were not implied in the question what
it is. For certainly, if it is in the pleasure of the body, he is
blessed who enjoys the pleasure of the body; if in goodness of
mind, he has it who enjoys this; if in both, he who enjoys both.
When, therefore, one says, to live blessedly is to enjoy the
pleasure of the body; but another, to live blessedly is to enjoy
goodness of mind; is it not, that either both know, or both do not
know, what a blessed life is? How, then, do both love it, if no one
can love what he does not know? Or is that perhaps false which we
have assumed to be most true and most certain, <i>viz</i>. that all
men will to live blessedly? For if to live blessedly is, for
argument&#8217;s sake, to live according to goodness of mind, how does
he will to live blessedly who does not will this? Should we not say
more truly, That man does not will to live blessedly, because he
does not wish to live according to goodness, which alone is to live
blessedly? Therefore all men do not will to live blessedly; on the
contrary, few wish it; if to live blessedly is nothing else but to
live according to goodness of mind, which many do not will to do.
Shall we, then, hold that to be false of which the Academic Cicero
himself did not doubt (although Academics doubt every thing), who,
when he wanted in the dialogue <i>Hortensius</i> to find some
certain thing, of which no one doubted, from which to start his
argument, says, We certainly all will to be blessed? Far be it from
me to say this is false. But what then? Are we to say that,
although there is no other way of living blessedly than living
according to goodness of mind, yet even he who does not will this,
wills to live blessedly? This, indeed, seems too absurd. For it is
much as if we should say, Even he who does not will to live
blessedly, wills to live blessedly. Who could listen to, who could
endure, such a contradiction? And yet necessity thrusts us into
this strait, if it is both true that all will to live blessedly,
and yet all do not will to live in that way in which alone one can
live blessedly.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.v-p2">8. Or is, perhaps, the deliverance
from our difficulties to be found in this, that, since we have said
that every one places his idea of a blessed life in that which has
most pleased him, as pleasure pleased Epicurus, and goodness Zeno,
and something else pleased other people, we say that to live
blessedly is nothing else but to live according to one&#8217;s own
pleasure: so that it is not false that all will to live blessedly,
because all will that which pleases each? For if this, too, had
been proclaimed to the people in the theatre, all would have found
it in their own wills. But <pb n="171" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_171.html" id="iv.i.xv.v-Page_171"/>when Cicero, too, had
propounded this in opposition to himself, he so refuted it as to
make them blush who thought so. For he says: &#8220;But, behold! people
who are not indeed philosophers, but who yet are prompt to dispute,
say that all are blessed, whoever live as they will;&#8221; which is
what we mean by, as pleases each. But by and by he has subjoined:
&#8220;But this is indeed false. For to will what is not fitting, is
itself most miserable; neither is it so miserable not to obtain
what one wills, as to will to obtain what one ought not.&#8221; Most
excellently and altogether most truly does he speak. For who can be
so blind in his mind, so alienated from all light of decency, and
wrapped up in the darkness of indecency, as to call him blessed,
because he lives as he will, who lives wickedly and disgracefully;
and with no one restraining him, no one punishing, and no one
daring even to blame him, nay more, too, with most people praising
him, since, as divine Scripture says, &#8220;The wicked is praised in
his heart&#8217;s desire: and he who works iniquity is blessed,&#8221;<note place="end" n="801" id="iv.i.xv.v-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.v-p3"> <scripRef passage="Ps. x. 3" id="iv.i.xv.v-p3.2" parsed="|Ps|10|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.10.3">Ps. x. 3</scripRef></p></note> gratifies
all his most criminal and flagitious desires; when, doubtless,
although even so he would be wretched, yet he would be less
wretched, if he could have had nothing of those things which he had
wrongly willed? For every one is made wretched by a wicked will
also, even though it stop short with will but more wretched by the
power by which the longing of a wicked will is fulfilled. And,
therefore, since it is true that all men will to be blessed, and
that they seek for this one thing with the most ardent love, and on
account of this seek everything which they do seek; nor can any one
love that of which he does not know at all what or of what sort it
is, nor can be ignorant what that is which he knows that he wills;
it follows that all know a blessed life. But all that are blessed
have what they will, although not all who have what they will are
forewith blessed. But they are forewith wretched, who either have
not what they will, or have that which they do not rightly will.
Therefore he only is a blessed man, who both has all things which
he wills, and wills nothing ill.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.vi-p2">9. Since, then, a blessed life
consists of these two things, and is known to all, and dear to all;
what can we think to be the cause why, when they cannot have both,
men choose, out of these two, to have all things that they will,
rather than to will all things well, even although they do not have
them? Is it the depravity itself of the human race, in such wise
that, while they are not unaware that neither is he blessed who has
not what he wills, nor he who has what he wills wrongly, but he who
both has whatsoever good things he wills, and wills no evil ones,
yet, when both are not granted of those two things in which the
blessed life consists, that is rather chosen by which one is
withdrawn the more from a blessed life (since he certainly is
further from it who obtains things which he wickedly desired, than
he who only does not obtain the things which he desired); whereas
the good will ought rather to be chosen, and to be preferred, even
if it do not obtain the things which it seeks? For he comes near to
being a blessed man, who wills well whatsoever he wills, and wills
things, which when he obtains, he will be blessed. And certainly
not bad things, but good, make men blessed, when they do so make
them. And of good things he already has something, and that, too, a
something not to be lightly esteemed,&#8212;namely, the very good will
itself; who longs to rejoice in those good things of which human
nature is capable, and not in the performance or the attainment of
any evil; and who follows diligently, and attains as much as he
can, with a prudent, temperate, courageous, and right mind, such
good things as are possible in the present miserable life; so as to
be good even in evils, and when all evils have been put an end to,
and all good things fulfilled, then to be blessed.</p>

nor will he will anything that will be wanting, nor will there be
wanting anything which he shall have willed. Whatever shall be
loved, will be present; nor will that be longed for, which shall
not be present. Everything which will be there will be good, and
the supreme God will be the supreme good and will be present for
those to enjoy who love Him; and what altogether is most blessed,
it will be certain that it will be so forever. But now, indeed,
philosophers have made for themselves, according to the pleasure of
each, their own ideals of a blessed life; that they might be able,
as it were by their own power, to do that, which by the common
conditions of mortals they were not able to do,&#8212;namely, to live
as they would. For they felt that no one could be blessed otherwise
than by having what he would, and by suffering nothing which he
would not. And who would not will, that the life whatsoever it be,
with which he is delighted, and which he therefore calls blessed,
were so in his own power, that he could have it continually? And
yet who is in this condition? Who wills to suffer troubles in order
that he may endure them manfully, although he both wills and is
able to endure them if he does suffer them? Who would will to live
in torments, even although he is able to live laudably by holding
fast to righteousness in the midst of them through patience? They
who have endured these evils, either in wishing to have or in
fearing to lose what they loved, whether wickedly or laudably, have
thought of them as transitory. For many have stretched boldly
through transitory evils to good things which will last. And these,
doubtless, are blessed through hope, even while actually suffering
such transitory evils, through which they arrive at good things
which will not be transitory. But he who is blessed through hope is
not yet blessed: for he expects, through patience, a blessedness
which he does not yet grasp. Whereas he, on the other hand, who is
tormented without any such hope, without any such reward, let him
use as much endurance as he pleases, is not truly blessed, but
bravely miserable. For he is not on that account not miserable,
because he would be more so if he also bore misery impatiently.
Further, even if he does not suffer those things which he would not
will to suffer in his own body, not even then is he to be esteemed
blessed, inasmuch as he does not live as he wills. For to omit
other things, which, while the body remains unhurt, belong to those
annoyances of the mind, without which we should will to live, and
which are innumerable; he would will, at any rate, if he were able,
so to have his body safe and sound, and so to suffer no
inconveniences from it, as to have it within his own control, or
even to have it with an imperishableness of the body itself; and
because he does not possess this, and hangs in doubt about it, he
certainly does not live as he wills. For although he may be ready
from fortitude to accept, and bear with an equal mind, whatever
adversities may happen to him, yet he had rather they should not
happen, and prevents them if he is able; and he is in such way
ready for both alternatives, that, as much as is in him, he wishes
for the one and shuns the other; and if he have fallen into that
which he shuns, he therefore bears it willingly, because that could
not happen which he willed. He bears it, therefore, in order that
he may not be crushed; but he would not willingly be even burdened.
How, then, does he live as he wills? Is it because he is willingly
strong to bear what he would not will to be put upon him? Then he
only wills what he can, because he cannot have what he wills. And
here is the sum-total of the blessedness of proud mortals, I know
not whether to be laughed at, or not rather to be pitied, who boast
that they live as they will, because they willingly bear patiently
what they are unwilling should happen to them. For this, they say,
is like Terence&#8217;s wise saying,&#8212;</p>

will that which cannot be. But such a life is not for this mortal
state, neither will it come to pass unless when immortality also
shall come to pass. And if this could not be given at all to man,
blessedness too would be sought in vain, since it cannot be without
immortality.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.viii-p2">11. As, therefore, all men will to
be blessed, certainly, if they will truly, they will also to be
immortal; for otherwise they could not be blessed. And further, if
questioned also concerning immortality, as before concerning
blessedness, all reply that they will 
<pb n="173" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_173.html" id="iv.i.xv.viii-Page_173"/>it. But blessedness of
what quality soever, such as is not so, but rather is so called, is
sought, nay indeed is feigned in this life, whilst immortality is
despaired of, without which true blessedness cannot be. Since he
lives blessedly, as we have already said before, and have
sufficiently proved and concluded, who lives as he wills, and wills
nothing wrongly. But no one wrongly wills immortality, if human
nature is by God&#8217;s gift capable of it; and if it is not capable
of it, it is not capable of blessedness. For, that a man may live
blessedly, he must needs live. And if life quits him by his dying,
how can a blessed life remain with him? And when it quits him,
without doubt it either quits him unwilling, or willing, or
neither. If unwilling, how is the life blessed which is so within
his will as not to be within his power? And whereas no one is
blessed who wills something that he does not have, how much less is
he blessed who is quitted against his will, not by honor, nor by
possessions, nor by any other thing, but by the blessed life
itself, since he will have no life at all? And hence, although no
feeling is left for his life to be thereby miserable (for the
blessed life quits him, because life altogether quits him), yet he
is wretched as long as he feels, because he knows that against his
will that is being destroyed for the sake of which he loves all
else, and which he loves beyond all else. A life therefore cannot
both be blessed, and yet quit a man against his will, since no one
becomes blessed against his will; and hence how much more does it
make a man miserable by quitting him against his will, when it
would make him miserable if he had it against his will! But if it
quit him with his will, even so how was that a blessed life, which
he who had it willed should perish? It remains then for them to
say, that neither of these is in the mind of the blessed man; that
is, that he is neither unwilling nor willing to be quitted by a
blessed life, when through death life quits him altogether; for
that he stands firm with an even heart, prepared alike for either
alternative. But neither is that a blessed life which is such as to
be unworthy of his love whom it makes blessed. For how is that a
blessed life which the blessed man does not love? Or how is that
loved, of which it is received indifferently, whether it is to
flourish or to perish? Unless perhaps the virtues, which we love in
this way on account of blessedness alone, venture to persuade us
that we do not love blessedness itself. Yet if they did this, we
should certainly leave off loving the virtues themselves, when we
do not love that on account of which alone we loved them. And
further, how will that opinion be true, which has been so tried,
and sifted, and thoroughly strained, and is so certain, <i>viz.</i>
that all men will to be blessed, if they themselves who are already
blessed neither will nor do not will to be blessed? Or if they will
it, as truth proclaims, as nature constrains, in which indeed the
supremely good and unchangeably blessed Creator has implanted that
will: if, I say, they will to be blessed who are blessed, certainly
they do not will to be not blessed. But if they do not will not to
be blessed, without doubt they do not will to be annihilated and
perish in regard to their blessedness. But they cannot be blessed
except they are alive; therefore they do not will so to perish in
regard to their life. Therefore, whoever are either truly blessed
or desire to be so, will to be immortal. But he does not live
blessedly who has not that which he wills. Therefore it follows
that in no way can life be truly blessed unless it be
eternal.</p>

human reasonings, scarcely a few, and they endued with great
abilities, and abounding in leisure, and learned with the most
subtle learning, have been able to attain to the investigation of
the immortality of the soul alone. And even for the soul they have
not found a blessed life that is stable, that is, true; since they
have said that it returns to the miseries of this life even after
blessedness. And they among them who are ashamed of this opinion,
and have thought that the purified soul is to be placed in eternal
happiness without a body, hold such opinions concerning the past
eternity of the world, as to confute this opinion of theirs
concerning the soul; a thing which here it is too long to
demonstrate; but it has been, as I think, sufficiently explained by
us in the twelfth book of the <i>City of God</i>.<note place="end" n="804" id="iv.i.xv.ix-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.ix-p3"> C. 20.</p></note> But that faith promises, not by

must show also, not indeed that no other mode was possible to God,
to whose power all things are equally subject, but that there
neither was nor need have been any other mode more appropriate for
curing our misery. For what was so necessary for the building up of
our hope, and for the freeing the minds of mortals cast down by the
condition of mortality itself, from despair of immortality, than
that it should be demonstrated to us at how great a price God rated
us, and how greatly He loved us? But what is more manifest and
evident in this so great proof hereof, than that the Son of God,
unchangeably good, remaining what He was in Himself, and receiving
from us and for us what He was not, apart from any loss of His own

afterwards speaks of as saved by His life. We were not, therefore,
before that grace merely anyhow sinners, but in such sins that we
were enemies of God. But the same apostle calls us above several
times by two appellations, <i>viz</i>. sinners and enemies of
God,&#8212;one as if the most mild, the other plainly the most
harsh,&#8212;saying, &#8220;For if when we were yet weak, in due time

could have seeing that it could have it when it wanted it. And this
foregoing sentence of the apostle, where he says, &#8220;For when we
were yet weak, in due time He died for the ungodly,&#8221; coheres with
those two following sentences; in the one of which he spoke of
sinners, in the other of enemies of God, as though he referred each

God to the ungodly.</p>

beseech you, that they who believe should be justified in it? And
what is meant by &#8220;being reconciled by the death of His Son?&#8221;
Was it indeed so, that when God the Father was wroth with us, He
saw the death of His Son for us, and was appeased towards us? Was
then His Son already so far appeased towards us, that He even
deigned to die for us; while the Father was still so far wroth,
that except His Son died for us, He would not be appeased? And
what, then, is that which the same teacher of the Gentiles himself
says in another place: &#8220;What shall we then say to these things?
If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not His own
Son, but delivered Him up for us all; how has He not with Him also
freely given us all things?&#8221;<note place="end" n="811" id="iv.i.xv.xi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xi-p3"> <scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 31, 32" id="iv.i.xv.xi-p3.2" parsed="|Rom|8|31|8|32" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.31-Rom.8.32">Rom. viii. 31, 32</scripRef></p></note> Pray, unless the Father had been
already appeased, would He have delivered up His own Son, not

contrary to that? In the one, the Son dies for us, and the Father
is reconciled to us by His death; in the other, as though the
Father first loved us, He Himself on our account does not spare the
Son, He Himself for us delivers Him up to death. But I see that the
Father loved us also before, not only before the Son died for us,
but before He created the world; the apostle himself being witness,

12.&#8212;All, on Account of the Sin of Adam, Were Delivered into the

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p2">16. By the justice of God in some
sense, the human race was delivered into the power of the devil;
the sin of the first man passing over originally into all of both
sexes in their birth through conjugal union, and the debt of our
first parents binding their whole posterity. This delivering up is
first signified in Genesis, where, when it had been said to the
serpent, &#8220;Dust shalt thou eat,&#8221; it was said to the man, &#8220;Dust
thou art, and unto dust thou shall return.&#8221;<note place="end" n="814" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 14-19" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|3|14|3|19" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.14-Gen.3.19">Gen. iii. 14&#8211;19</scripRef></p></note> In the words, &#8220;Unto dust shalt
thou return,&#8221; the death of the body is fore-announced, because he
would not have experienced that either, if he had continued to the
end upright as he was made; but in that it is said to him whilst
still living, &#8220;Dust thou art,&#8221; it is shown that the whole man
was changed for the worse. For &#8220;Dust thou art&#8221; is much the same
as, &#8220;My spirit shall not always remain in these men, for that
they also are flesh.&#8221;<note place="end" n="815" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Gen. vi. 3" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p4.2" parsed="|Gen|6|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.6.3">Gen. vi. 3</scripRef>. &#8220;Strive
with man,&#8221; A.V.</p></note> Therefore it was at that time
shown, that he was delivered to him, in that it had been said to
him, &#8220;Dust shall thou eat.&#8221; But the apostle declares this more
clearly, where he says: &#8220;And you who were dead in trespasses and
sins, wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of
this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the
spirit that now worketh in the children of unfaithfulness; among
whom we also had our conversation in times past, in the lusts of
our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and
were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.&#8221;<note place="end" n="816" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p5"> <scripRef passage="Eph. ii. 1-3" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p5.2" parsed="|Eph|2|1|2|3" osisRef="Bible:Eph.2.1-Eph.2.3">Eph. ii. 1&#8211;3</scripRef></p></note> The
&#8220;children of unfaithfulness&#8221; are the unbelievers; and who is
not this before he becomes a believer? And therefore all men are
originally under the prince of the power of the air, &#8220;who worketh
in the children of unfaithfulness.&#8221; And that which I have
expressed by &#8220;originally&#8221; is the same that the apostle
expresses when he speaks of themselves who &#8220;by nature&#8221; were as
others; <i>viz</i>. by nature as it has been depraved by sin, not
as it was created upright from the beginning. But the way in which
man was thus delivered into the power of the devil, ought not to be
so understood as if God did this, or commanded it to be done; but
that He only permitted it, yet that justly. For when He abandoned
the sin<pb n="176" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_176.html" id="iv.i.xv.xii-Page_176"/>ner, the author of the sin immediately entered. Yet God
did not certainly so abandon His own creature as not to show
Himself to him as God creating and quickening, and among penal
evils bestowing also many good things upon the evil. For He hath
not in anger shut up His tender mercies.<note place="end" n="817" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p6"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lxxvii. 9" id="iv.i.xv.xii-p6.2" parsed="|Ps|77|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.77.9">Ps. lxxvii. 9</scripRef></p></note> Nor did He dismiss man from the law
of His own power, when He permitted him to be in the power of the
devil; since even the devil himself is not separated from the power
of the Omnipotent, as neither from His goodness. For whence do even
the evil angels subsist in whatever manner of life they have,
except through Him who quickens all things? If, therefore, the
commission of sins through the just anger of God subjected man to
the devil, doubtless the remission of sins through the merciful
reconciliation of God rescues man from the devil.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.xiii-p2">17. But the devil was to be
overcome, not by the power of God, but by His righteousness. For
what is more powerful than the Omnipotent? Or what creature is
there of which the power can be compared to the power of the
Creator? But since the devil, by the fault of his own perversity,
was made a lover of power, and a forsaker and assailant of
righteousness,&#8212;for thus also men imitate him so much the more in
proportion as they set their hearts on power, to the neglect or
even hatred of righteousness, and as they either rejoice in the
attainment of power, or are inflamed by the lust of it,&#8212;it
pleased God, that in order to the rescuing of man from the grasp of
the devil, the devil should be conquered, not by power, but by
righteousness; and that so also men, imitating Christ, should seek
to conquer the devil by righteousness, not by power. Not that power
is to be shunned as though it were something evil; but the order
must be preserved, whereby righteousness is before it. For how
great can be the power of mortals? Therefore let mortals cleave to
righteousness; power will be given to immortals. And compared to
this, the power, how great soever, of those men who are called
powerful on earth, is found to be ridiculous weakness, and a
pitfall is dug there for the sinner, where the wicked seem to be
most powerful. And the righteous man says in his song, &#8220;Blessed
is the man whom Thou chasteneth, O Lord, and teachest him out of
Thy law: that Thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,
until the pit be digged for the wicked. For the Lord will not cast
off His people, neither will He forsake His inheritance, until
righteousness return unto judgment, and all who follow it are
upright in heart.&#8221;<note place="end" n="818" id="iv.i.xv.xiii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xiii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xciv. 12-15" id="iv.i.xv.xiii-p3.2" parsed="|Ps|94|12|94|15" osisRef="Bible:Ps.94.12-Ps.94.15">Ps. xciv. 12&#8211;15</scripRef></p></note> At this present time, then, in
which the might of the people of God is delayed, &#8220;the Lord will
not cast off His people, neither will He forsake His
inheritance,&#8221; how bitter and unworthy things soever it may suffer
in its humility and weakness; &#8220;until the righteousness,&#8221; which
the weakness of the pious now possesses, &#8220;shall return to
judgment,&#8221; that is, shall receive the power of judging; which is
preserved in the end for the righteous when power in its due order
shall have followed after righteousness going before. For power
joined to righteousness, or righteousness added to power,
constitutes a judicial authority. But righteousness belongs to a
good will; whence it was said by the angels when Christ was born:
&#8220;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good
will.&#8221;<note place="end" n="819" id="iv.i.xv.xiii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xiii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Luke ii. 14" id="iv.i.xv.xiii-p4.2" parsed="|Luke|2|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.2.14">Luke ii. 14</scripRef></p></note> But power
ought to follow righteousness, not to go before it; and accordingly
it is placed in &#8220;second,&#8221; that is, prosperous fortune; and this

two things make a man blessed, as we have argued above, to will
well, and to be able to do what one wills, people ought not to be
so perverse, as has been noted in the same discussion, as that a
man should choose from the two things which make him blessed, the
being able to do what he wills, and should neglect to will what he
ought; whereas he ought first to have a good will, but great power
afterwards. Further, a good will must be purged from vices, by
which if a man is overcome, he is in such wise overcome as that he
wills evil; and then how will his will be still good? It is to be
wished, then, that power may now be given, but power against vices,
to conquer which men do not wish to be powerful, while they wish to
be so in order to conquer men; and why is this, unless that, being
in truth conquered, they feignedly conquer, and are conquerors not
in truth, but in opinion? Let a man will to be prudent, will to be
strong, will to be temperate, will to be just; and that he may be
able to have these things truly, let him certainly desire power,
and seek to be powerful in himself, and (strange though it be)
against himself for himself. But all the other things which he
wills rightly, and yet is not able to have, as, for instance,
immortality and true and full felicity, let him not cease to long
for, and let him patiently expect.</p>

righteousness by which the devil was conquered? What, except the
righteousness of Jesus Christ? And how was he conquered? Because,
when he found in Him nothing worthy of death, yet he slew Him. And
certainly it is just, that we whom he held as debtors, should be
dismissed free by believing in Him whom he slew without any debt.
In this way it is that we are said to be justified in the blood of
Christ.<note place="end" n="821" id="iv.i.xv.xiv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xiv-p3"> <scripRef passage="Rom. v. 9" id="iv.i.xv.xiv-p3.2" parsed="|Rom|5|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.5.9">Rom. v. 9</scripRef></p></note> For so that

by the thing seized, because sin is laid hold of against what is
lawful. Whence also He says, by the mouth of His own Flesh, as is
read in the Gospel: &#8220;For the prince of this world cometh, and
hath nothing in me,&#8221; that is, no sin; but &#8220;that the world may
know,&#8221; He says, &#8220;that I do the commandment of the Father;

passion, that He might pay for us debtors that which He Himself did
not owe. Would then the devil be conquered by this most just right,
if Christ had willed to deal with him by power, not by
righteousness? But He held back what was possible to Him, in order
that He might first do what was fitting. And hence it was necessary
that He should be both man and God. For unless He had been man, He
could not have been slain; unless He had been God, men would not
have believed that He would not do what He could, but that He could
not do what He would; nor should we have thought that righteousness
was preferred by Him to power, but that He lacked power. But now He
suffered for us things belonging to man, because He was man; but if
He had been unwilling, it would have been in His power to not so to
suffer, because He was also God. And righteousness was therefore
made more acceptable in humility, because so great power as was in
His Divinity, if He had been unwilling, would have been able not to
suffer humility; and thus by Him who died, being thus powerful,
both righteousness was commended, and power promised, to us, weak
mortals. For He did one of these two things by dying, the other by
rising again. For what is more righteous, than to come even to the
death of the cross for righteousness? And what more powerful, than
to rise from the dead, and to ascend into heaven with that very
flesh in which He was slain? And therefore He conquered the devil
first by righteousness, and afterwards by power: namely, by
righteousness, because He had no sin, and was slain by him most
unjustly; but by power, because having been dead He lived again,
never afterwards to die.<note place="end" n="825" id="iv.i.xv.xiv-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xiv-p7"> <scripRef passage="Rom. vi. 9" id="iv.i.xv.xiv-p7.2" parsed="|Rom|6|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.6.9">Rom. vi. 9</scripRef></p></note> But He would have conquered the
devil by power, even though He could not have been slain by him:
although it belongs to a greater power to conquer death itself also
by rising again, than to avoid it by living. But the reason is
really a different one, why we are justified in the blood of
Christ, when we are rescued from the power of the devil through the
remission of sins: it pertains to this, that the devil is conquered
by Christ by righteousness, not by power. For Christ was crucified,
not through immortal power, but through the weakness which He took
upon Him in mortal flesh; of which weakness nevertheless the
apostle says, &#8220;that the weakness of God is stronger than
men.&#8221;<note place="end" n="826" id="iv.i.xv.xiv-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xiv-p8"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 25" id="iv.i.xv.xiv-p8.2" parsed="|1Cor|1|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.25">1 Cor. i. 25</scripRef></p></note></p>

that the devil was conquered, when he who was slain by Him rose
again. It is something more, and more profound of comprehension, to
see that the devil was conquered when he thought himself to have
conquered, that is, when Christ was slain. For then that blood,
since it was His who had no sin at all, was poured out for the
remission of our sins; that, because the devil deservedly held
those whom, as guilty of sin, he bound by the condition of death,
he might deservedly loose them through Him, whom, as guilty of no
sin, the punishment of death undeservedly affected. The strong man
was conquered by this righteousness, and bound with this chain,

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p2">20. For although the death, too, of
the flesh itself came originally from the sin of the first man, yet
the good use of it has made most glorious martyrs. And so not only
that death itself, but all the evils of this world, and the griefs
and labors of men, although they come from the deserts of sins, and
especially of original sin, whence life itself too became bound by
the bond of death, yet have fitly remained, even when sin is
forgiven; that man might have wherewith to contend for truth, and
whereby the goodness of the faithful might be exercised; in order
that the new man through the new covenant might be made ready among
the evils of this world for a new world, by bearing wisely the
misery which this condemned life deserved, and by rejoicing soberly
because it will be finished, but expecting faithfully and patiently
the blessedness which the future life, being set free, will have
for ever. For the devil being cast forth from his dominion, and
from the hearts of the faithful, in the condemnation and
faithlessness of whom he, although himself also condemned, yet
reigned, is only so far permitted to be an adversary according to
the condition of this mortality, as God knows to be expedient for
them: concerning which the sacred writings speak through the mouth
of the apostle: &#8220;God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be
tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also
make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.&#8221;<note place="end" n="834" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 13" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|10|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.13">1 Cor. x. 13</scripRef></p></note> And those
evils which the faithful endure piously, are of profit either for
the correction of sins, or for the exercising and proving of
righteousness, or to manifest the misery of this life, that the
life where will be that true and perpetual blessedness may be
desired more ardently, and sought out more earnestly. But it is on
their account that these evils are still kept in being, of whom the
apostle says: &#8220;For we know that all things work together for good
to them that love God, to them who are called to be holy according
to His purpose. For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate
to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the
first-born among many brethren. Moreover, whom He did predestinate,
them He also called; and whom He called, them He also justified;
and whom He justified, them He also glorified.&#8221; It is of these
who are predestinated, that not one shall perish with the devil;
not one shall remain even to death under the power of the devil.
And then follows what I have already cited above:<note place="end" n="835" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p4"> C. 2.</p></note> &#8220;What shall we then say to these
things? If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not
His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all; how has He not with
Him also freely given us all things?&#8221;<note place="end" n="836" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p5"> <scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 28-32" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p5.2" parsed="|Rom|8|28|8|32" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.28-Rom.8.32">Rom. viii. 28&#8211;32</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p6">21. Why then should the death of
Christ not have come to pass? Nay, rather, why should not that
death itself have been chosen above all else to be brought to pass,
to the passing by of the other innumerable ways which He who is
omnipotent could have employed to free us; that death, I say,
wherein neither was anything diminished or changed from His
divinity, and so great benefit was conferred upon men, from the
humanity which He took upon Him, that a temporal death, which was
not due, was rendered by the eternal Son of God, who was also the
Son of man, whereby He might free them from an eternal <pb n="179" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_179.html" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-Page_179"/>death which
was due? The devil was holding fast our sins, and through them was
fixing us deservedly in death. He discharged them, who had none of
His own, and who was led by him to death undeservedly. That blood
was of such price, that he who even slew Christ for a time by a
death which was not due, can as his due detain no one, who has put
on Christ, in the eternal death which was due. Therefore &#8220;God
commendeth His love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners,
Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified in His
blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.&#8221; Justified, he
says, in His blood,&#8212;justified plainly, in that we are freed from
all sin; and freed from all sin, because the Son of God, who knew
no sin, was slain for us. Therefore &#8220;we shall be saved from wrath
through Him;&#8221; from the wrath certainly of God, which is nothing
else but just retribution. For the wrath of God is not, as is that
of man, a perturbation of the mind; but it is the wrath of Him to
whom Holy Scripture says in another place, &#8220;But Thou, O Lord,
mastering Thy power, judgest with calmness.&#8221;<note place="end" n="837" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p7"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. xii. 18" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p7.2" parsed="|Wis|12|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.12.18">Wisd. xii. 18</scripRef></p></note> If, therefore, the just retribution
of God has received such a name, what can be the right
understanding also of the reconciliation of God, unless that then
such wrath comes to an end? Neither were we enemies to God, except
as sins are enemies to righteousness; which being forgiven, such
enmities come to an end, and they whom He Himself justifies are
reconciled to the Just One. And yet certainly He loved them even
while still enemies, since &#8220;He spared not His own Son, but
delivered Him up for us all,&#8221; when we were still enemies. And
therefore the apostle has rightly added: &#8220;For if, when we were
enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son,&#8221; by
which that remission of sins was made, &#8220;much more, being
reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.&#8221; Saved in life, who
were reconciled by death. For who can doubt that He will give His
life for His friends, for whom, when enemies, He gave His death?
&#8220;And not only so,&#8221; he says, &#8220;but we also joy in God, through
our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the
atonement.&#8221; &#8220;Not only,&#8221; he says, &#8220;shall we be saved,&#8221; but
&#8220;we also joy;&#8221; and not in ourselves, but &#8220;in God;&#8221; nor
through ourselves, &#8220;but through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we
have now received the atonement,&#8221; as we have argued above. Then
the apostle adds, &#8220;Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the
world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, in whom
all have sinned;&#8221;<note place="end" n="838" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p8"> <scripRef passage="Rom. v. 8, 12" id="iv.i.xv.xvi-p8.2" parsed="|Rom|5|8|0|0;|Rom|5|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.5.8 Bible:Rom.5.12">Rom. v. 8, 12</scripRef></p></note> etc.: in which he disputes at some

are freed from the debts both of our first father and of ourselves.
Further, since on account of that one the devil held all who were
begotten through his corrupted carnal concupiscence, it is just
that on account of this one he should loose all who are regenerated
through His immaculate spiritual grace.</p>

Advantages of the Incarnation.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.xvii-p2">22. There are many other things
also in the incarnation of Christ, displeasing as it is to the
proud, that are to be observed and thought of advantageously. And
one of them is, that it has been demonstrated to man what place he
has in the things which God has created; since human nature could
so be joined to God, that one person could be made of two
substances, and thereby indeed of three&#8212;God, soul, and flesh: so
that those proud malignant spirits, who interpose themselves as
mediators to deceive, although as if to help, do not therefore dare
to place themselves above man because they have not flesh; and
chiefly because the Son of God deigned to die also in the same
flesh, lest they, because they seem to be immortal, should
therefore succeed in getting themselves worshipped as gods.
Further, that the grace of God might be commended to us in the man
Christ without any precedent merits; because not even He Himself
obtained by any precedent merits that He should be joined in such
great unity with the true God, and should become the Son of God,
one Person with Him; but from the time when He began to be man,
from that time He is also God; whence it is said, &#8220;The Word was
made flesh.&#8221;<note place="end" n="839" id="iv.i.xv.xvii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xvii-p3"> <scripRef passage="John i. 14" id="iv.i.xv.xvii-p3.2" parsed="|John|1|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.14">John i. 14</scripRef></p></note> Then, again,
there is this, that the pride of man, which is the chief hindrance
against his cleaving to God, can be confuted and healed through
such great humility of God. Man learns also how far he has gone
away from God; and what it is worth to him as a pain to cure him,
when he returns through such a Mediator, who both as God assists
men by His divinity, and as man agrees with men by His weakness.
For what greater example of obedience could be given to us, who had
perished through disobedience, <pb n="180" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_180.html" id="iv.i.xv.xvii-Page_180"/>than God the Son obedient to
God the Father, even to the death of the cross?<note place="end" n="840" id="iv.i.xv.xvii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xvii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Phil. ii. 8" id="iv.i.xv.xvii-p4.2" parsed="|Phil|2|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.2.8">Phil. ii. 8</scripRef></p></note> Nay, wherein could the reward of
obedience itself be better shown, than in the flesh of so great a
Mediator, which rose again to eternal life? It belonged also to the
justice and goodness of the Creator, that the devil should be
conquered by the same rational creature which he rejoiced to have
conquered, and by one that came from that same race which, by the
corruption of its origin through one, he held
altogether.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.xviii-p2">23. For assuredly God could have
taken upon Himself to be man, that in that manhood He might be the
Mediator between God and men, from some other source, and not from
the race of that Adam who bound the human race by his sin; as He
did not create him whom He first created, of the race of some one
else. Therefore He was able, either so, or in any other mode that
He would, to create yet one other, by whom the conqueror of the
first might be conquered. But God judged it better both to take
upon Him man through whom to conquer the enemy of the human race,
from the race itself that had been conquered; and yet to do this of
a virgin, whose conception, not flesh but spirit, not lust but
faith, preceded.<note place="end" n="841" id="iv.i.xv.xviii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xviii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Luke i. 26-32" id="iv.i.xv.xviii-p3.2" parsed="|Luke|1|26|1|32" osisRef="Bible:Luke.1.26-Luke.1.32">Luke i. 26&#8211;32</scripRef></p></note> Nor did that
concupiscence of the flesh intervene, by which the rest of men, who
derive original sin, are propagated and conceived; but holy
virginity became pregnant, not by conjugal intercourse, but by
faith,&#8212;lust being utterly absent,&#8212;so that that which was born
from the root of the first man might derive only the origin of
race, not also of guilt. For there was born, not a nature corrupted
by the contagion of transgression, but the one only remedy of all
such corruptions. There was born, I say, a Man having nothing at
all, and to have nothing at all, of sin; through whom they were to
be born again so as to be freed from sin, who could not be born
without sin. For although conjugal chastity makes a right use of
the carnal concupiscence which is in our members; yet it is liable
to motions not voluntary, by which it shows either that it could
not have existed at all in paradise before sin, or if it did, that
it was not then such as that sometimes it should resist the will.
But now we feel it to be such, that in opposition to the law of the
mind, and even if there is no question of begetting, it works in us
the incitement of sexual intercourse; and if in this men yield to
it, then it is satisfied by an act of sin; if they do not, then it
is bridled by an act of refusal: which two things who could doubt
to have been alien from paradise before sin? For neither did the
chastity that then was do anything indecorous, nor did the pleasure
that then was suffer anything unquiet. It was necessary, therefore,
that this carnal concupiscence should be entirely absent, when the
offspring of the Virgin was conceived; in whom the author of death
was to find nothing worthy of death, and yet was to slay Him in
order that he might be conquered by the death of the Author of
life: the conqueror of the first Adam, who held fast the human
race, conquered by the second Adam, and losing the Christian race,
freed out of the human race from human guilt, through Him who was
not in the guilt, although He was of the race; that that deceiver
might be conquered by that race which he had conquered by guilt.
And this was so done, in order that man may not be lifted up, but
&#8220;that he that glorieth should glory in the Lord.&#8221;<note place="end" n="842" id="iv.i.xv.xviii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xviii-p4"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. x. 17" id="iv.i.xv.xviii-p4.2" parsed="|2Cor|10|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.10.17">2 Cor. x. 17</scripRef></p></note> For he who
was conquered was only man; and he was therefore conquered, because
he lusted proudly to be a god. But He who conquered was both man
and God; and therefore He so conquered, being born of a virgin,
because God in humility did not, as He governs other saints, so
govern that Man, but bare Him [as a Son]. These so great gifts of
God, and whatever else there are, which it is too long for us now
upon this subject both to inquire and to discuss, could not exist

Word made flesh did and bare for us in time and place, belong,
according to the distinction which we have undertaken to
demonstrate, to knowledge, not to wisdom. And as the Word is
without time and without place, it is co-eternal with the Father,
and in its wholeness everywhere; and if any one can, and as much as
he can, speak truly concerning this Word, then his discourse will
pertain to wisdom. And hence the Word made flesh, which is Christ
Jesus, has the treasures both of wisdom and of knowledge. For the
apostle, writing to the Colossians, says: &#8220;For I would that ye
knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea,
and for as many as have not seen my face in the <pb n="181" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_181.html" id="iv.i.xv.xix-Page_181"/>flesh; that
their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and

are in such way to be distinguished from each other, that wisdom is
to be assigned to divine things, knowledge to human, I acknowledge
both in Christ, and so with me do all His faithful ones. And when I
read, &#8220;The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,&#8221; I
understand by the Word the true Son of God, I acknowledge in the
flesh the true Son of man, and both together joined into one Person
of God and man, by an ineffable copiousness of grace. And on
account of this, the apostle goes on to say, &#8220;And we beheld His
glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father, full of
grace and truth.&#8221;<note place="end" n="845" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p5"> <scripRef passage="John i. 14" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p5.2" parsed="|John|1|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.14">John i. 14</scripRef></p></note> If we refer grace to knowledge, and
truth to wisdom, I think we shall not swerve from that distinction
between these two things which we have commended. For in those
things that have their origin in time, this is the highest grace,
that man is joined with God in unity of person; but in things
eternal the highest truth is rightly attributed to the Word of God.
But that the same is Himself the Only-begotten of the Father, full
of grace and truth,&#8212;this took place, in order that He Himself in
things done for us in time should be the same for whom we are
cleansed by the same faith, that we may contemplate Him steadfastly
in things eternal. And those distinguished philosophers of the
heathen who have been able to understand and discern the invisible
things of God by those things which are made, have yet, as is said
of them, &#8220;held down the truth in iniquity;&#8221;<note place="end" n="846" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p6"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 23" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p6.2" parsed="|Rom|1|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.23">Rom. i. 23</scripRef>; <i>

a Mediator, that is, without the man Christ, whom they neither
believed to be about to come at the word of the prophets, nor to
have come at that of the apostles. For, placed as they were in
these lowest things, they could not but seek some media through
which they might attain to those lofty things which they had
understood; and so they fell upon deceitful spirits, through whom
it came to pass, that &#8220;they changed the glory of the
incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and
to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.&#8221;<note place="end" n="847" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p7"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 18, 20" id="iv.i.xv.xix-p7.2" parsed="|Rom|1|18|0|0;|Rom|1|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.18 Bible:Rom.1.20">Rom. i. 18, 20</scripRef></p></note> For in such
forms also they set up or worshipped idols. Therefore Christ is our
knowledge, and the same Christ is also our wisdom. He Himself
implants in us faith concerning temporal things, He Himself shows
forth the truth concerning eternal things. Through Him we reach on
to Himself: we stretch through knowledge to wisdom; yet we do not
withdraw from one and the same Christ, &#8220;in whom are hidden all
the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge.&#8221; But now we speak of
knowledge, and will hereafter speak of wisdom as much as He Himself
shall grant. And let us not so take these two things, as if it were
not allowable to speak either of the wisdom which is in human
things, or of the knowledge which is in divine. For after a laxer
custom of speech, both can be called wisdom, and both knowledge.
Yet the apostle could not in any way have written, &#8220;To one is
given the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge,&#8221;
except also these several things had been properly called by the
several names, of the distinction between which we are now
treating.</p>

it has reached. It belongs to all men to will to be blessed; yet
all men have not faith, whereby the heart is cleansed, and so
blessedness is reached. And thus it comes to pass, that by means of
the faith which not all men will, we have to reach on to the
blessedness which every one wills. All see in their own heart that
they will to be blessed; and so great is the agreement of human
nature on this subject, that the man is not deceived who
conjectures this concerning another&#8217;s mind, out of his own: in
short, we know ourselves that all will this. But many despair of
being immortal, although no otherwise can any one be that which all
will, that is, blessed. Yet they will also to be immortal if they
could; but through not believing that they can, they do not so live
that they can. Therefore faith is necessary, that we may attain
blessedness in all the good things of human nature, that is, of
both soul <pb n="182" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_182.html" id="iv.i.xv.xx-Page_182"/>and body. But that same faith requires that this faith
be limited in Christ, who rose in the flesh from the dead, not to
die any more; and that no one is freed from the dominion of the
devil, through the forgiveness of sins, save by Him; and that in
the abiding place of the devil, life must needs be at once
miserable and never-ending, which ought rather to be called death
than life. All which I have also argued, so far as space permitted,
in this book, while I have already said much on the subject in the
fourth book of this work as well;<note place="end" n="848" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p3"> Cc. 19&#8211;21.</p></note> but in that place for one purpose,
here for another,&#8212;namely, there, that I might show why and how
Christ was sent in the fullness of time by the Father,<note place="end" n="849" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p4"> <scripRef passage="Gal. iv. 4" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p4.2" parsed="|Gal|4|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.4.4">Gal. iv. 4</scripRef></p></note> on account
of those who say that He who sent and He who was sent cannot be
equal in nature; but here, in order to distinguish practical
knowlege from contemplative wisdom.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p5">26. For we wished to ascend, as it
were, by steps, and to seek in the inner man, both in knowledge and
in wisdom, a sort of trinity of its own special kind, such as we
sought before in the outer man; in order that we may come, with a
mind more practised in these lower things, to the contemplation of
that Trinity which is God, according to our little measure, if
indeed, we can even do this, at least in a riddle and as through a
glass.<note place="end" n="850" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p6"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiii. 12" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p6.2" parsed="|1Cor|13|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.12">1 Cor. xiii. 12</scripRef></p></note> If, then,
any one have committed to memory the words of this faith in their
sounds alone, not knowing what they mean, as they commonly who do
not know Greek hold in memory Greek words, or similarly Latin ones,
or those of any other language of which they are ignorant, has not
he a sort of trinity in his mind? because, first, those sounds of
words are in his memory, even when he does not think thereupon; and
next, the mental vision (<i>acies</i>) of his act of recollection
is formed thence when he conceives of them; and next, the will of
him who remembers and thinks unites both. Yet we should by no means
say that the man in so doing busies himself with a trinity of the
interior man, but rather of the exterior; because he remembers, and
when he wills, contemplates as much as he wills, that alone which
belongs to the sense of the body, which is called hearing. Nor in
such an act of thought does he do anything else than deal with
images of corporeal things, that is, of sounds. But if he holds and
recollects what those words signify, now indeed something of the
inner man is brought into action; not yet, however, ought he to be
said or thought to live according to a trinity of the inner man, if
he does not love those things which are there declared, enjoined,
promised. For it is possible for him also to hold and conceive
these things, supposing them to be false, in order that he may
endeavor to disprove them. Therefore that will, which in this case
unites those things which are held in the memory with those things
which are thence impressed on the mind&#8217;s eye in conception,
completes, indeed, some kind of trinity, since itself is a third
added to two others; but the man does not live according to this,
when those things which are conceived are taken to be false, and
are not accepted. But when those things are believed to be true,
and those things which therein ought to be loved, are loved, then
at last the man does live according to a trinity of the inner man;
for every one lives according to that which he loves. But how can
things be loved which are not known, but only believed? This
question has been already treated of in former books;<note place="end" n="851" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p7"> Bk. viii. cc. 8 seqq., and Bk. x.
c. 1, etc.</p></note> and we
found, that no one loves what he is wholly ignorant of, but that
when things not known are said to be loved, they are loved from
those things which are known. And now we so conclude this book,
that we admonish the just to live by faith,<note place="end" n="852" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p8"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 17" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p8.2" parsed="|Rom|1|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.17">Rom. i. 17</scripRef></p></note> which faith worketh by love,<note place="end" n="853" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p8.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p9"> <scripRef passage="Gal. v. 6" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p9.2" parsed="|Gal|5|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.5.6">Gal. v. 6</scripRef></p></note> so that the
virtues also themselves, by which one lives prudently, boldly,
temperately, and justly, be all referred to the same faith; for not
otherwise can they be true virtues. And yet these in this life are
not of so great worth, as that the remission of sins, of some kind
or other, is not sometimes necessary here; and this remission comes
not to pass, except through Him, who by His own blood conquered the
prince of sinners. Whatsoever ideas are in the mind of the faithful
man from this faith, and from such a life, when they are contained
in the memory, and are looked at by recollection, and please the
will, set forth a kind of trinity of its own sort.<note place="end" n="854" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p9.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xv.xx-p10"> [The ternary is this: 1. The idea

image of God, of which by His help we shall afterwards speak, is
not yet in that trinity; a thing which will then be more apparent,

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.i-p13">2. But if to dispute of wisdom
belongs to wise men, what shall we do? Shall we dare indeed to
profess wisdom, lest it should be mere impudence for ourselves to
dispute about it? Shall we not be alarmed by the example of
Pythagoras?&#8212;who dared not profess to be a wise man, but answered
that he was a philosopher, <i>i.e.</i>, a lover of wisdom; whence
arose the name, that became thenceforth so much the popular name,
that no matter how great the learning wherein any one excelled,
either in his own opinion or that of others, in things pertaining
to wisdom, he was still called nothing more than philosopher. Or
was it for this reason that no one, even of <pb n="184" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_184.html" id="iv.i.xvi.i-Page_184"/>such as
these, dared to profess himself a wise man,&#8212;because they imagined
that a wise man was one without sin? But our Scriptures do not say
this, which say, &#8220;Rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.&#8221;<note place="end" n="865" id="iv.i.xvi.i-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.i-p14"> <scripRef passage="Prov. ix. 8" id="iv.i.xvi.i-p14.2" parsed="|Prov|9|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.9.8">Prov. ix. 8</scripRef></p></note> For
doubtless he who thinks a man ought to be rebuked, judges him to
have sin. However, for my part, I dare not profess myself a wise
man even in this sense; it is enough for me to assume, what they
themselves cannot deny, that to dispute of wisdom belongs also to
the philosopher, <i>i.e</i>., the lover of wisdom. For they have
not given over so disputing who have professed to be lovers of
wisdom rather than wise men.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.i-p15">3. In disputing, then, about
wisdom, they have defined it thus: Wisdom is the knowledge of
things human and divine. And hence, in the last book, I have not
withheld the admission, that the cognizance of both subjects,
whether divine or human, may be called both knowledge and wisdom.<note place="end" n="866" id="iv.i.xvi.i-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.i-p16"> Bk. xiii. cc. 1, 19.</p></note> But
according to the distinction made in the apostle&#8217;s words, &#8220;To
one is given the word of wisdom, to another the word of
knowledge,&#8221;<note place="end" n="867" id="iv.i.xvi.i-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.i-p17"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiii. 12" id="iv.i.xvi.i-p17.2" parsed="|1Cor|13|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.12">1 Cor. xiii. 12</scripRef></p></note> this
definition is to be divided, so that the knowledge of things divine
shall be called wisdom, and that of things human appropriate to
itself the name of knowledge; and of the latter I have treated in
the thirteenth book, not indeed so as to attribute to this
knowledge everything whatever that can be known by man about things
human, wherein there is exceeding much of empty vanity and
mischievous curiosity, but only those things by which that most
wholesome faith, which leads to true blessedness, is begotten,
nourished, defended, strengthened; and in this knowledge most of
the faithful are not strong, however exceeding strong in the faith
itself. For it is one thing to know only what man ought to believe
in order to attain to a blessed life, which must needs be an
eternal one; but another to know in what way this belief itself may
both help the pious, and be defended against the impious, which
last the apostle seems to call by the special name of knowledge.
And when I was speaking of this knowledge before, my especial
business was to commend faith, first briefly distinguishing things
eternal from things temporal, and there discoursing of things
temporal; but while deferring things eternal to the present book, I
showed also that faith respecting things eternal is itself a thing
temporal, and dwells in time in the hearts of believers, and yet is
necessary in order to attain the things eternal themselves.<note place="end" n="868" id="iv.i.xvi.i-p17.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.i-p18"> Bk. xiii. c. 7.</p></note> I argued
also, that faith respecting the things temporal which He that is
eternal did and suffered for us as man, which manhood He bare in
time and carried on to things eternal, is profitable also for the
obtaining of things eternal; and that the virtues themselves,
whereby in this temporal and mortal life men live prudently,
bravely, temperately, and justly, are not true virtues, unless they
are referred to that same faith, temporal though it is, which leads
on nevertheless to things eternal.</p>

contemplating, and loving this temporal faith, we have not yet
reached such a trinity as is to be called an image of God; lest
that should seem to be constituted in things temporal which ought
to be so in things eternal. For when the human mind sees its own
faith, whereby it believes what it does not see, it does not see a
thing eternal. For that will not always exist, which certainly will
not then exist, when this pilgrimage, whereby we are absent from
God, in such way that we must needs walk by faith, shall be ended,
and that sight shall have succeeded it whereby we shall see face to
face;<note place="end" n="871" id="iv.i.xvi.ii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.ii-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiii. 12" id="iv.i.xvi.ii-p5.2" parsed="|1Cor|13|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.12">1 Cor. xiii. 12</scripRef></p></note> just as now,
because we believe although we do not see, we shall deserve to see,
and shall rejoice at having been brought through faith to sight.
For then it will be no longer faith, by which that is believed
which is not seen; but sight, by which that is seen which is
believed. And then, therefore, although we remember this past
mortal life, and call to mind by recollection that we once believed
what we did not see, yet that faith will be reckoned among things
past and done with, not among things present and always continuing.
And hence also that trinity which now consists in the remembering,
contemplating, and loving this same faith while present and
continuing, will then be found to be done with and past, and not
still enduring. And hence it is to be gathered, that if that
trinity is indeed an im<pb n="185" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_185.html" id="iv.i.xvi.ii-Page_185"/>age of God, then this image
itself would have to be reckoned, not among things that exist

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.iii-p2">But far be it from us to think,
that while the nature of the soul is immortal, and from the first
beginning of its creation thenceforth never ceases to be, yet that
that which is the best thing it has should not endure for ever with
its own immortality. Yet what is there in its nature as created,
better than that it is made after the image of its Creator?<note place="end" n="872" id="iv.i.xvi.iii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.iii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gen. i. 27" id="iv.i.xvi.iii-p3.2" parsed="|Gen|1|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.27">Gen. i. 27</scripRef></p></note> We must find

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.iii-p4">5. Shall we then scrutinize
somewhat more carefully and deeply whether the case is really thus?
For it may be said that this trinity does not perish even when
faith itself shall have passed away; because, as now we both hold
it by memory, and discern it by thought, and love it by will; so
then also, when we shall both hold in memory, and shall recollect,
that we once had it, and shall unite these two by the third, namely
will, the same trinity will still continue. Since, if it have left
in its passage as it were no trace in us, doubtless we shall not
have ought of it even in our memory, whereto to recur when
recollecting it as past, and by the third, <i>viz</i>. purpose,
coupling both these, to wit, what was in our memory though we were
not thinking about it, and what is formed thence by conception. But
he who speaks thus, does not perceive, that when we hold, see, and
love in ourselves our present faith, we are concerned with a
different trinity as now existing, from that trinity which will
exist, when we shall contemplate by recollection, not the faith
itself, but as it were the imagined trace of it laid up in the
memory, and shall unite by the will, as by a third, these two
things, <i>viz</i>. that which was in the memory of him who
retains, and that which is impressed thence upon the vision of the
mind of him who recollects. And that we may understand this, let us
take an example from things corporeal, of which we have
sufficiently spoken in the eleventh book.<note place="end" n="873" id="iv.i.xvi.iii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.iii-p5"> Cc. 2 sq.</p></note> For as we ascend from lower to
higher things, or pass inward from outer to inner things, we first
find a trinity in the bodily object which is seen, and in the
vision of the seer, which, when he sees it, is informed thereby,
and in the purpose of the will which combines both. Let us assume a
trinity like this, when the faith which is now in ourselves is so
established in our memory as the bodily object we spoke of was in
place, from which faith is formed the conception in recollection,
as from that bodily object was formed the vision of the beholder;
and to these two, to complete the trinity, will is to be reckoned
as a third, which connects and combines the faith established in
the memory, and a sort of effigy of that faith impressed upon the
vision of recollection; just as in that trinity of corporeal
vision, the form of the bodily object that is seen, and the
corresponding form wrought in the vision of the beholder, are
combined by the purpose of the will. Suppose, then, that this
bodily object which was beheld was dissolved and had perished, and
that nothing at all of it remained anywhere, to the vision of which
the gaze might have recourse; are we then to say, that because the
image of the bodily object thus now past and done with remains in
the memory, whence to form the conception in recollecting, and to
have the two united by will as a third, therefore it is the same
trinity as that former one, when the appearance of the bodily
object posited in place was seen? Certainly not, but altogether a
different one: for, not to say that that was from without, while
this is from within; the former certainly was produced by the
appearance of a present bodily object, the latter by the image of
that object now past. So, too, in the case of which we are now
treating, to illustrate which we have thought good to adduce this
example, the faith which is even now in our mind, as that bodily
object was in place, while held, looked at, loved, produces a sort
of trinity; but that trinity will exist no more, when this faith in
the mind, like that bodily object in place, shall no longer exist.
But that which will then exist, when we shall remember it to have
been, but not now to be, in us, will doubtless be a different one.
For that which now is, is wrought by the thing itself, actually
present and attached to the mind of one who believes; but that
which shall then be, will be wrought by the imagination of a past
thing left in the memory of one who recollects.</p>

is to Be Sought in the Immortality of the Rational Soul. How a
Trinity is Demonstrated in the Mind.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.iv-p2">6. Therefore neither is that
trinity an image of God, which is not now, nor is that other an
image of God, which then will not be; but we must find in the soul
of man, <i>i.e.</i>, <pb n="186" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_186.html" id="iv.i.xvi.iv-Page_186"/>the rational or intellectual
soul, that image of the Creator which is immortally implanted in
its immortality. For as the immortality itself of the soul is
spoken with a qualification; since the soul too has its proper
death, when it lacks a blessed life, which is to be called the true
life of the soul; but it is therefore called immortal, because it
never ceases to live with some life or other, even when it is most
miserable;&#8212;so, although reason or intellect is at one time torpid
in it, at another appears small, and at another great, yet the
human soul is never anything save rational or intellectual; and
hence, if it is made after the image of God in respect to this,
that it is able to use reason and intellect in order to understand
and behold God, then from the moment when that nature so marvellous
and so great began to be, whether this image be so worn out as to
be almost none at all, or whether it be obscure and defaced, or
bright and beautiful, certainly it always is. Further, too, pitying
the defaced condition of its dignity, divine Scripture tells us,
that &#8220;although man walks in an image, yet he disquieteth himself
in vain; he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather
them.&#8221;<note place="end" n="874" id="iv.i.xvi.iv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.iv-p3"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xxxix. 7" id="iv.i.xvi.iv-p3.2" parsed="|Ps|39|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.39.7">Ps. xxxix. 7</scripRef></p></note> It would not
therefore attribute vanity to the image of God, unless it perceived
it to have been defaced. Yet it sufficiently shows that such
defacing does not extend to the taking away its being an image, by
saying, &#8220;Although man walks in an image.&#8221; Wherefore in both
ways that sentence can be truly enunciated; in that, as it is said,
&#8220;Although man walketh in an image, yet he disquieteth himself in
vain,&#8221; so it may be said, &#8220;Although man disquieteth himself in
vain, yet he walketh in an image.&#8221; For although the nature of the
soul is great, yet it can be corrupted, because it is not the
highest; and although it can be corrupted, because it is not the
highest, yet because it is capable and can be partaker of the
highest nature, it is a great nature. Let us seek, then, in this
image of God a certain trinity of a special kind, with the aid of
Him who Himself made us after His own image. For no otherwise can
we healthfully investigate this subject, or arrive at any result
according to the wisdom which is from Him. But if the reader will
either hold in remembrance and recollect what we have said of the
human soul or mind in former books, and especially in the tenth, or
will carefully re-peruse it in the passages wherein it is
contained, he will not require here any more lengthy discourse
respecting the inquiry into so great a thing.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.iv-p4">7. We said, then, among other
things in the tenth book, that the mind of man knows itself. For
the mind knows nothing so much as that which is close to itself;
and nothing is more close to the mind than itself. We adduced also
other evidences, as much as seemed sufficient, whereby this might
be most certainly proved.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.v-p2">What, then, is to be said of the
mind of an infant, which is still so small, and buried in such
profound ignorance of things, that the mind of a man which knows
anything shrinks from the darkness of it? Is that too to be
believed to know itself; but that, as being too intent upon those
things which it has begun to perceive through the bodily senses,
with the greater delight in proportion to their novelty, it is not
able indeed to be ignorant of itself, but is also not able to think
of itself? Moreover, how intently it is bent upon sensible things
that are without it, may be conjectured from this one fact, that it
is so greedy of sensible light, that if any one through
carelessness, or ignorance of the possible consequences, place a
light at nighttime where an infant is lying down, on that side to
which the eyes of the child so lying down can be bent, but its neck
cannot be turned, the gaze of that child will be so fixed in that
direction, that we have known some to have come to squint by this
means, in that the eyes retained that form which habit in some way
impressed upon them while tender and soft.<note place="end" n="875" id="iv.i.xvi.v-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.v-p3"> [This occurred in the the case of
Edward Irving. Oliphant&#8217;s <i>Life of

bodily senses, the souls of infants, as far as their age permits,
so narrow themselves as it were, and are bent upon them, that they
either vehemently detest or vehemently desire that only which
offends or allures through the flesh, but do not think of their own
inward self, nor can be made to do so by admonition; because they
do not yet know the signs that express admonition, whereof words
are the chief, of which as of other things they are wholly
ignorant. And that it is one thing not to know oneself, another not
to think of oneself, we have shown already in the same book.<note place="end" n="876" id="iv.i.xvi.v-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.v-p4"> Bk. x. c. 5.</p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.v-p5">8. But let us pass by the infantine
age, since we cannot question it as to what goes on within itself,
while we have ourselves pretty well forgotten it. Let it suffice
only for us hence to be certain, that when man has come to be able
to think of the nature of his own mind, and to find out what is the
truth, he <pb n="187" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_187.html" id="iv.i.xvi.v-Page_187"/>will find it nowhere else but in himself. And he will
find, not what he did not know, but that of which he did not think.
For what do we know, if we do not know what is in our own mind;
when we can know nothing at all of what we do know, unless by the
mind?</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xvi.vi-p1.1">Chapter 6.&#8212;How a Kind of Trinity Exists in the Mind
Thinking of Itself. What is the Part of Thought in This
Trinity.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.vi-p2">The function of thought, however,
is so great, that not even the mind itself can, so to say, place
itself in its own sight, except when it thinks of itself; and hence
it is so far the case, that nothing is in the sight of the mind,
except that which is being thought of, that not even the mind
itself, whereby we think whatever we do think, can be in its own
sight otherwise than by thinking of itself. But in <i>what way</i>
it is not in its own sight when it is not thinking of itself, while
it can never <i>be</i> without itself, as though itself were one
thing, and the sight of itself another, it is not in my power to
discover. For this is not unreasonably said of the eye of the body;
for the eye itself of the body is fixed in its own proper place in
the body, but its sight extends to things external to itself, and
reaches even to the stars. And the eye is not in its own sight,
since it does not look at itself, unless by means of a mirror, as
is said above;<note place="end" n="877" id="iv.i.xvi.vi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.vi-p3"> Bk. x. c. 3.</p></note> a thing that
certainly does not happen when the mind places itself in its own
sight by thinking of itself. Does it then see one part of itself by
means of another part of itself, when it looks at itself in
thought, as we look at some of our members, which can be in our
sight, with other also of our members, <i>viz</i>. with our eyes?
What can be said or thought more absurd? For by what is the mind
removed, except by itself? or where is it placed so as to be in its
own sight, except before itself? Therefore it will not be there,
where it was, when it was not in its own sight; because it has been
put down in one place, after being taken away from another. But if
it migrated in order to be beheld, where will it remain in order to
behold? Is it as it were doubled, so as to be in this and in that
place at the same time, <i>viz.</i> both where it can behold, and
where it can be beheld; that in itself it may be beholding, and
before itself beheld? If we ask the truth, it will tell us nothing
of the sort since it is but feigned images of bodily objects of
which we conceive when we conceive thus; and that the mind is not
such, is very certain to the few minds by which the truth on such a
subject can be inquired. It appears, therefore, that the beholding
of the mind is something pertaining to its nature, and is recalled
to that nature when it conceives of itself, not as if by moving
through space, but by an incorporeal conversion; but when it is not
conceiving of itself, it appears that it is not indeed in its own
sight, nor is its own perception formed from it, but yet that it
knows itself as though it were to itself a remembrance of itself.
Like one who is skilled in many branches of learning: the things
which he knows are contained in his memory, but nothing thereof is
in the sight of his mind except that of which he is conceiving;
while all the rest are stored up in a kind of secret knowledge,
which is called memory. The trinity, then, which we were setting
forth, was constituted in this way: first, we placed in the memory
the object by which the perception of the percipient was formed;
next, the conformation, or as it were the image which is impressed
thereby; lastly, love or will as that which combines the two. When
the mind, then, beholds itself in conception, it understands and
cognizes itself; it begets, therefore, this its own understanding
and cognition. For an incorporeal thing is understood when it is
beheld, and is cognized when understood. Yet certainly the mind
does not so beget this knowledge of itself, when it beholds itself
as understood by conception, as though it had before been unknown
to itself; but it was known to itself, in the way in which things
are known which are contained in the memory, but of which one is
not thinking; since we say that a man knows letters even when he is
thinking of something else, and not of letters. And these two, the
begetter and the begotten, are coupled together by love, as by a
third, which is nothing else than will, seeking or holding fast the
enjoyment of something. We held, therefore, that a trinity of the
mind is to be intimated also by these three terms, memory,
intelligence, will.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.vi-p4">9. But since the mind, as we said
near the end of the same tenth book, always remembers itself, and
always understands and loves itself, although it does not always
think of itself as distinguished from those things which are not
itself; we must inquire in what way understanding
(<i>intellectus</i>) belongs to conception, while the notion
(<i>notitia</i>) of each thing that is in the mind, even when one
is not thinking of it, is said to belong only to the memory. For if
this is so, then the mind had not these three things: <i>viz</i>.
the remembrance, the understanding, and the love of itself; but it
only remembered itself, and afterwards, 
<pb n="188" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_188.html" id="iv.i.xvi.vi-Page_188"/>when it began to think
of itself, then it understood and loved itself.</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xvi.vii-p1.1">Chapter 7.&#8212;The Thing is Made Plain by an Example. In
What Way the Matter is Handled in Order to Help the
Reader.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.vii-p2">Wherefore let us consider more
carefully that example which we have adduced, wherein it was shown
that not knowing a thing is different from not thinking
[conceiving] of it; and that it may so happen that a man knows
something of which he is not thinking, when he is thinking of
something else, not of that. When any one, then, who is skilled in
two or more branches of knowledge is thinking of one of them,
though he is not thinking of the other or others, yet he knows
them. But can we rightly say, This musician certainly knows music,
but he does not now understand it, because he is not thinking of
it; but he does now understand geometry, for of that he is now
thinking? Such an assertion, as far as appears, is absurd. What,
again, if we were to say, This musician certainly knows music, but
he does not now love it, while he is not now thinking of it; but he
does now love geometry, because of that he is now thinking,&#8212;is
not this similarly absurd? But we say quite correctly, This person
whom you perceive disputing about geometry is also a perfect
musician, for he both remembers music, and understands, and loves
it; but although he both knows and loves it, he is not now thinking
of it, since he is thinking of geometry, of which he is disputing.
And hence we are warned that we have a kind of knowledge of certain
things stored up in the recesses of the mind, and that this, when
it is thought of, as it were, steps forth in public, and is placed
as if openly in the sight of the mind; for then the mind itself
finds that it both remembers, and understands, and loves itself,
even although it was not thinking of itself, when it was thinking
of something else. But in the case of that of which we have not
thought for a long time, and cannot think of it unless reminded;
that, if the phrase is allowable, in some wonderful way I know not
how, we do not <i>know</i> that we know. In short, it is rightly
said by him who reminds, to him whom he reminds, You know this, but
you do not know that you know it; I will remind you, and you will
find that you know what you had thought you did not know. Books,
too, lead to the same results, <i>viz</i>. those that are written
upon subjects which the reader under the guidance of reason finds
to be true; not those subjects which he believes to be true on the
faith of the narrator, as in the case of history; but those which
he himself also finds to be true, either of himself, or in that
truth itself which is the light of the mind. But he who cannot
contemplate these things, even when reminded, is too deeply buried
in the darkness of ignorance, through great blindness of heart and
too wonderfully needs divine help, to be able to attain to true
wisdom.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.vii-p3">10. For this reason I have wished
to adduce some kind of proof, be it what it might, respecting the
act of conceiving, such as might serve to show in what way, out of
the things contained in the memory, the mind&#8217;s eye is informed in
recollecting, and some such thing is begotten, when a man
conceives, as was already in him when, before he conceived, he
remembered; because it is easier to distinguish things that take
place at successive times, and where the parent precedes the
offspring by an interval of time. For if we refer ourselves to the
inner memory of the mind by which it remembers itself, and to the
inner understanding by which it understands itself, and to the
inner will by which it loves itself, where these three always are
together, and always have been together since they began to be at
all, whether they were being thought of or not; the image of this
trinity will indeed appear to pertain even to the memory alone; but
because in this case a word cannot be without a thought (for we <i>
think</i> all that we say, even if it be said by that inner word
which belongs to no separate language), this image is rather to be
discerned in these three things, <i>viz.</i> memory, intelligence,
will. And I mean now by intelligence that by which we understand in
thought, that is, when our thought is formed by the finding of
those things, which had been at hand to the memory but were not
being thought of; and I mean that will, or love, or preference
which combines this offspring and parent, and is in some way common
to both. Hence it was that I tried also, <i>viz.</i> in the
eleventh book, to lead on the slowness of readers by means of
outward sensible things which are seen by the eyes of the flesh;
and that I then proceeded to enter with them upon that power of the
inner man whereby he reasons of things temporal, deferring the
consideration of that which dominates as the higher power, by which
he contemplates things eternal. And I discussed this in two books,
distinguishing the two in the twelfth, the one of them being higher
and the other lower, and that the lower ought to be subject to the
higher; and in the thirteenth I discussed, with what truth and
brevity I could, the office of the lower, in which the wholesome
knowledge of things human is contained, in order that we may
so <pb n="189" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_189.html" id="iv.i.xvi.vii-Page_189"/>act in this temporal life as to attain that which is
eternal; since, indeed, I have cursorily included in a single book
a subject so manifold and copious, and one so well known by the
many and great arguments of many and great men, while manifesting
that a trinity exists also in it, but not yet one that can be
called an image of God.</p>

<div4 type="Chapter" title="The Trinity Which is the Image of God is Now to Be Sought in the Noblest Part of the Mind." n="8" shorttitle="Chapter 8" progress="35.64%" prev="iv.i.xvi.vii" next="iv.i.xvi.ix" id="iv.i.xvi.viii"><p class="c39" id="iv.i.xvi.viii-p1">

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xvi.viii-p1.1">Chapter 8.&#8212;The Trinity Which is the Image of God is
Now to Be Sought in the Noblest Part of the Mind.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.viii-p2">11. But we have come now to that
argument in which we have undertaken to consider the noblest part
of the human mind, by which it knows or can know God, in order that
we may find in it the image of God. For although the human mind is
not of the same nature with God, yet the image of that nature than
which none is better, is to be sought and found in us, in that than
which our nature also has nothing better. But the mind must first
be considered as it is in itself, before it becomes partaker of
God; and His image must be found in it. For, as we have said,
although worn out and defaced by losing the participation of God,
yet the image of God still remains.<note place="end" n="878" id="iv.i.xvi.viii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.viii-p3"> <i>Supra</i>, c. iv.</p></note> For it is His image in this very
point, that it is capable of Him, and can be partaker of Him; which
so great good is only made possible by its being His image. Well,
then, the mind remembers, understands, loves itself; if we discern
this, we discern a trinity, not yet indeed God, but now at last an
image of God. The memory does not receive from without that which
it is to hold; nor does the understanding find without that which
it is to regard, as the eye of the body does; nor has will joined
these two from without, as it joins the form of the bodily object
and that which is thence wrought in the vision of the beholder; nor
has conception, in being turned to it, found an image of a thing
seen without, which has been somehow seized and laid up in the
memory, whence the intuition of him that recollects has been
formed, will as a third joining the two: as we showed to take place
in those trinities which were discovered in things corporeal, or
which were somehow drawn within from bodily objects by the bodily
sense; of all which we have discoursed in the eleventh book.<note place="end" n="879" id="iv.i.xvi.viii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.viii-p4"> Cc. 2 sq.</p></note> Nor, again,
as it took place, or appeared to do so, when we went on further to
discuss that knowledge, which had its place now in the workings of
the inner man, and which was to be distinguished from wisdom; of
which knowledge the subject-matter was, as it were, adventitious to
the mind, and either was brought thither by historical
information,&#8212;as deeds and words, which are performed in time and
pass away, or which again are established in the nature of things
in their own times and places,&#8212;or arises in the man himself not
being there before, whether on the information of others, or by his
own thinking,&#8212;as faith, which we commended at length in the
thirteenth book, or as the virtues, by which, if they are true, one
so lives well in this mortality as to live blessedly in that
immortality which God promises. These and other things of the kind
have their proper order in time, and in that order we discerned
more easily a trinity of memory, sight, and love. For some of such
things anticipate the knowledge of learners. For they are knowable
also before they are known, and beget in the learner a knowledge of
themselves. And they either exist in their own proper places, or
have happened in time past; although things that are past do not
themselves exist, but only certain signs of them as past, the sight
or hearing of which makes it known that they have been and have
passed away. And these signs are either situate in the places
themselves, as <i>e.g.</i> monuments of the dead or the like; or
exist in written books worthy of credit, as is all history that is
of weight and approved authority; or are in the minds of those who
already know them; since what is already known to them is knowable
certainly to others also, whose knowledge it has anticipated, and
who are able to know it on the information of those who do know it.
And all these things, when they are learned, produce a certain kind
of trinity, <i>viz.</i> by their own proper species, which was
knowable also before it was known, and by the application to this
of the knowledge of the learner, which then begins to exist when he
learns them, and by will as a third which combines both; and when
they are known, yet another trinity is produced in the recollecting
of them, and this now inwardly in the mind itself, from those
images which, when they were learned, were impressed upon the
memory, and from the informing of the thought when the look has
been turned upon these by recollection, and from the will which as
a third combines these two. But those things which arise in the
mind, not having been there before, as faith and other things of
that kind, although they appear to be adventitious, since they are
implanted by teaching, yet are not situate without or transacted
without, as are those things which are believed; but began to be
altogether within in the mind itself. For faith is not that which
is believed, but that by which it is believed; and the
former <pb n="190" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_190.html" id="iv.i.xvi.viii-Page_190"/>is believed, the latter seen. Nevertheless, because it
began to be in the mind, which was a mind also before these things
began to be in it, it seems to be somewhat adventitious, and will
be reckoned among things past, when sight shall have succeeded, and
itself shall have ceased to be. And it makes now by its presence,
retained as it is, and beheld, and loved, a different trinity from
that which it will then make by means of some trace of itself,
which in passing it will have left in the memory: as has been
already said above.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.ix-p2">12. There is, however, some
question raised, whether the virtues likewise by which one lives
well in this present mortality, seeing that they themselves begin
also to be in the mind, which was a mind none the less when it
existed before without them, cease also to exist at that time when
they have brought us to things eternal. For some have thought that
they will cease, and in the case of three&#8212;prudence, fortitude,
temperance&#8212;such an assertion seems to have something in it; but
justice is immortal, and will rather then be made perfect in us
than cease to be. Yet Tullius, the great author of eloquence, when
arguing in the dialogue <i>Hortensius</i>, says of all four: &#8220;If
we were allowed, when we migrated from this life, to live forever
in the islands of the blessed, as fables tell, what need were there
of eloquence when there would be no trials, or what need, indeed,
of the very virtues themselves? For we should not need fortitude
when nothing of either toil or danger was proposed to us; nor
justice, when there was nothing of anybody else&#8217;s to be coveted;
nor temperance, to govern lusts that would not exist; nor, indeed,
should we need prudence, when there was no choice offered between
good and evil. We should be blessed, therefore, solely by learning
and knowing nature, by which alone also the life of the gods is
praiseworthy. And hence we may perceive that everything else is a
matter of necessity, but this is one of free choice.&#8221; This great
orator, then, when proclaiming the excellence of philosophy, going
over again all that he had learned from philosophers, and
excellently and pleasantly explaining it, has affirmed all four
virtues to be necessary in this life only, which we see to be full
of troubles and mistakes; but not one of them when we shall have
migrated from this life, if we are permitted to live there where is
a blessed life; but that blessed souls are blessed only in learning
and knowing, <i>i.e.</i> in the contemplation of nature, than which
nothing is better and more lovable. It is that nature which created
and appointed all other natures. And if it belongs to justice to be
subject to the government of this nature then justice is certainly
immortal; nor will it cease to be in that blessedness, but will be
such and so great that it cannot be more perfect or greater.
Perhaps, too, the other three virtues&#8212;prudence although no longer
with any risk of error, and fortitude without the vexation of
bearing evils, and temperance without the thwarting of lust&#8212;will
exist in that blessedness: so that it may be the part of prudence
to prefer or equal no good thing to God; and of fortitude, to
cleave to Him most steadfastly; and of temperance, to be pleased by
no harmful defect. But that which justice is now concerned with in
helping the wretched, and prudence in guarding against treachery,
and fortitude in bearing troubles patiently, and temperance in
controlling evil pleasures, will not exist there, where there will
be no evil at all. And hence those acts of the virtues which are
necessary to this mortal life, like the faith to which they are to
be referred, will be reckoned among things past; and they make now
a different trinity, whilst we hold, look at, and love them as
present, from that which they will then make, when we shall
discover them not to be, but to have been, by certain traces of
them which they will have left in passing in the memory; since
then, too, there will be a trinity, when that trace, be it of what
sort it may, shall be retained in the memory, and truly recognized,
and then these two be joined by will as a third.</p>

10.&#8212;How a Trinity is Produced by the Mind Remembering,
Understanding, and Loving Itself.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.x-p2">13. In the knowledge of all these
temporal things which we have mentioned, there are some knowable
things which precede the acquisition of the knowledge of them by an
interval of time, as in the case of those sensible objects which
were already real before they were known, or of all those things
that are learned through history; but some things begin to be at
the same time with the knowing of them,&#8212;just as, if any visible
object, which did not exist before at all, were to rise up before
our eyes, certainly it does not precede our knowing it; or if there
be any sound made where there is some one to hear, no doubt the
sound and the hearing that sound begin and end simultaneously. Yet
none the less, whether preceding in time or beginning to exist
simultaneously, knowable things generate knowl<pb n="191" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_191.html" id="iv.i.xvi.x-Page_191"/>edge, and
are not generated by knowledge. But when knowledge has come to
pass, whenever the things known and laid up in memory are reviewed
by recollection, who does not see that the retaining them in the
memory is prior in time to the sight of them in recollection, and
to the uniting of the two things by will as a third? In the mind,
howver, it is not so. For the mind is not adventitious to itself,
as though there came to itself already existing, that same self not
already existing, from somewhere else, or did not indeed come from
somewhere else, but that in the mind itself already existing, there
was born that same mind not already existing; just as faith, which
before was not, arises in the mind which already was. Nor does the
mind see itself, as it were, set up in its own memory by
recollection subsequently to the knowing of itself, as though it
was not there before it knew itself; whereas, doubtless, from the
time when it began to be, it has never ceased to remember, to
understand, and to love itself, as we have already shown. And
hence, when it is turned to itself by thought, there arises a
trinity, in which now at length we can discern also a word; since
it is formed from thought itself, will uniting both. Here, then, we
may recognize, more than we have hitherto done, the image of which
we are in search.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.xi-p2">14. But some one will say, That is
not memory by which the mind, which is ever present to itself, is
affirmed to remember itself; for memory is of things past, not of
things present. For there are some, and among them Cicero, who, in
treating of the virtues, have divided prudence into these
three&#8212;memory, understanding, forethought: to wit, assigning
memory to things past, understanding to things present, forethought
to things future; which last is certain only in the case of those
who are prescient of the future; and this is no gift of men, unless
it be granted from above, as to the prophets. And hence the book of
Wisdom, speaking of men, &#8220;The thoughts of mortals,&#8221; it says,
&#8220;are fearful, and our forethought uncertain.&#8221;<note place="end" n="880" id="iv.i.xvi.xi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.xi-p3"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. ix. 14" id="iv.i.xvi.xi-p3.2" parsed="|Wis|9|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.9.14">Wisd. ix. 14</scripRef></p></note> But memory of things past, and
understanding of things present, are certain: certain, I mean,
respecting things incorporeal, which are present; for things
corporeal are present to the sight of the corporeal eyes. But let
any one who denies that there is any memory of things present,
attend to the language used even in profane literature, where
exactness of words was more looked for than truth of things. &#8220;Nor
did Ulysses suffer such things, nor did the Ithacan forget himself
in so great a peril.&#8221;<note place="end" n="881" id="iv.i.xvi.xi-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.xi-p4"> <i>&#198;neid</i>, iii. 628, 629.</p></note> For when Virgil said that Ulysses
did not forget himself, what else did he mean, except that he
remembered himself? And since he was present to himself, he could
not possibly remember himself, unless memory pertained to things
present. And, therefore, as that is called memory in things past
which makes it possible to recall and remember them; so in a thing
present, as the mind is to itself, that is not unreasonably to be
called memory, which makes the mind at hand to itself, so that it
can be understood by its own thought, and then both be joined
together by love of itself.</p>

it remembers, understands, and loves itself, then it is foolish.
Let it then remember its God, after whose image it is made, and let
it understand and love Him. Or to say the same thing more briefly,

says to you, You know me; and in order to remind you, tells you
where, when, and how he became known to you; and if, after the
mention of every sign by which you might be recalled to
remembrance, you still do not recognize him, then you have so come
to forget, as that the whole of that knowledge is altogether
blotted out of your mind; and nothing else remains, but that you
take his word for it who tells you that you once knew him; or do
not even do that, if you do not think the person who speaks to you
to be worthy of credit. But if you do remember him, then no doubt
you return to your own memory, and find in it that which had not
been altogether blotted out by forgetfulness. Let us return to that
which led us to adduce this instance from the intercourse of men.

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvi.xiv-p2">18. But there are yet more
testimonies in the divine Scriptures concerning the love of God.
For in it, those other two [namely, memory and understanding] are
understood by consequence, inasmuch as no one loves that which he
does not remember, or of which he is wholly ignorant. And hence is
that well known and primary commandment, &#8220;Thou shalt love the

mind, then, is so constituted, that at no time does it not
remember, and understand, and love itself. But since he who hates
any one is anxious to injure him, not undeservedly is the mind of
man also said to hate itself when it injures itself. For it wills
ill to itself through ignorance, in that it does not think that
what it wills is prejudicial to it; but it none the less does will
ill to itself, when it wills what would be prejudicial to it. And
hence it is written, &#8220;He that loveth iniquity, hateth his own
soul.&#8221;<note place="end" n="892" id="iv.i.xvi.xiv-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.xiv-p4"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xi. 5" id="iv.i.xvi.xiv-p4.2" parsed="|Ps|11|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.11.5">Ps. xi. 5</scripRef></p></note> He,

<pb n="193" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_193.html" id="iv.i.xvi.xiv-Page_193"/>he who
does not love God, even if he does love himself,&#8212;a thing
implanted in him by nature,&#8212;yet is not unsuitably said to hate
himself, inasmuch as he does that which is adverse to himself, and
assails himself as though he were his own enemy. And this is no
doubt a terrible delusion, that whereas all will to profit
themselves, many do nothing but that which is most pernicious to
themselves. When the poet was describing a like disease of dumb
animals, &#8220;May the gods,&#8221; says he, &#8220;grant better things to the
pious, and assign that delusion to enemies. They were rending with
bare teeth their own torn limbs.&#8221;<note place="end" n="893" id="iv.i.xvi.xiv-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvi.xiv-p5"> Virg. <i>Georg</i>. iii.

he was speaking of, why has he called it a delusion, unless
because, while nature inclines every animal to take all the care it
can of itself, that disease was such that those animals rent those
very limbs of theirs which they desired should be safe and sound?
But when the mind loves God, and by consequence, as has been said
remembers and understands Him, then it is rightly enjoined also to
love its neighbor as itself; for it has now come to love itself
rightly and not perversely when it loves God, by partaking of whom
that image not only exists, but is also renewed so as to be no
longer old, and restored so as to be no longer defaced, and
beatified so as to be no longer unhappy. For although it so love
itself, that, supposing the alternative to be proposed to it, it
would lose all things which it loves less than itself rather than
perish; still, by abandoning Him who is above it, in dependence
upon whom alone it could guard its own strength, and enjoy Him as
its light, to whom it is sung in the Psalm, &#8220;I will guard my

even such a man walketh in an image, and the man&#8217;s mind has
remembrance, understanding, and love of itself; if it were made

has heaped up, or the mind; who is so utterly without mind, as to
prefer to have the treasures rather than the mind? For treasures
commonly are able to subvert the mind, but the mind that is not
subverted by treasures can live more easily and unencumberedly
without any treasures. But who will be able to possess treasures
unless it be by means of the mind? For if an infant, born as rich
as you please, although lord of everything that is rightfully his,
yet possesses nothing if his mind be unconscious, how can any one
possibly possess anything whose mind is wholly lost? But why say of
treasures, that anybody, if the choice be given him, prefers going
without them to going without a mind; when there is no one that
prefers, nay, no one that compares them, to those lights of the
body, by which not one man only here and there, as in the case of
gold, but every man, possesses the very heaven? For every one
possesses by the eyes of the body whatever he gladly sees. Who then
is there, who, if he could not keep both, but must lose one, would
not rather lose his treasures than his eyes? And yet if it were put
to him on the same condition, whether he would rather lose eyes
than mind, who is there with a mind that does not see that he would
rather lose the former than the latter? For a mind without the eyes
of the flesh is still human, but the eyes of the flesh without a
mind are bestial. And who would not rather be a man, even though

no doubt, that it is wretched, and longs to be blessed nor can it
hope for the possibility of this on any other ground than its own
changeableness for if it were not changeable, then, as it could not
become wretched after being blessed, so neither could it become
blessed after being wretched. And what could have made it wretched
under an omnipotent and good God, except its own sin and the
righteousness of its Lord? And what will make it blessed, unless
its own merit, and its Lord&#8217;s reward? But its merit, too, is His
grace, whose reward will be its blessedness; for it cannot give
itself the righteousness it has lost, and so has not. For this it
received when man was created, and assuredly lost it by sinning.
Therefore it receives righteousness, that on account of this it may
deserve to receive blessedness; and hence the apostle truly says to
it, when beginning to be proud as it were of its own good, &#8220;For
what hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now if thou didst

has been blotted out by forgetfulness. But it is reminded, that it
may be turned to God, as though to that light by which it was in
some way touched, even when turned away from Him. For hence it is
that even the ungodly think of eternity, and rightly blame and
rightly praise many things in the morals of men. And by what rules
do they thus judge, except by those wherein they see how men ought
to live, even though they themselves do not so live? And where do
they see these rules? For they do not see them in their own [moral]
nature; since no doubt these things are to be seen by the mind, and
their minds are confessedly changeable, but these rules are seen as
unchangeable by him who can see them at all; nor yet in the
character of their own mind, since these rules are rules of
righteousness, and their minds are confessedly unrighteous. Where
indeed are these rules written, wherein even the unrighteous
recognizes what is righteous, wherein he discerns that he ought to
have what he himself has not? Where, then, are they written, unless
in the book of that Light which is called Truth? whence every
righteous law is <pb n="195" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_195.html" id="iv.i.xvi.xv-Page_195"/>copied and transferred (not by
migrating to it, but by being as it were impressed upon it) to the
heart of the man that worketh righteousness; as the impression from
a ring passes into the wax, yet does not leave the ring. But he who
worketh not, and yet sees how he ought to work, he is the man that
is turned away from that light, which yet touches him. But he who
does not even see how he ought to live, sins indeed with more
excuse, because he is not a transgressor of a law that he knows;
but even he too is just touched sometimes by the splendor of the
everywhere present truth, when upon admonition he
confesses.</p>

things, as though flesh were one, and the body of the flesh

flesh (for besides the flesh, there are many bodies celestial and
bodies terrestrial), he expressed by the body of the flesh that
body which is flesh. In like manner, therefore, by the spirit of
the mind, that spirit which is mind. Elsewhere, too, he has even
more plainly called it an image, while enforcing the same thing in
other words. &#8220;Do you,&#8221; he says, &#8220;putting off the old man with
his deeds, put on the new man, which is renewed in the knowledge of

righteousness and true holiness,&#8221; he has put in the latter, &#8220;In
the knowledge of God.&#8221; This renewal, then, and forming again of
the mind, is wrought either after God, or after the image of God.
But it is said to be after God, in order that it may not be
supposed to be after another creature; and to be after the image of
God, in order that this renewing may be understood to take place in
that wherein is the image of God, <i>i.e.</i> in the mind. Just as
we say, that he who has departed from the body a faithful and
righteous man, is dead after the body, not after the spirit. For
what do we mean by dead after the body, unless as to <pb n="196" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_196.html" id="iv.i.xvi.xvi-Page_196"/>the body or
in the body, and not dead as to the soul or in the soul? Or if we
want to say he is handsome after the body, or strong after the
body, not after the mind; what else is this, than that he is
handsome or strong in body, not in mind? And the same is the case
with numberless other instances. Let us not therefore so understand
the words, &#8220;After the image of Him that created him,&#8221; as though
it were a different image after which he is renewed, and not the
very same which is itself renewed.</p>

take place in the single moment of conversion itself, as that
renewal in baptism takes place in a single moment by the remission

strong again from the infirmity which the fever produced; and one
thing again to pluck out of the body a weapon thrust into it, and
another to heal the wound thereby made by a prosperous cure; so the
first cure is to remove the cause of infirmity, and this is wrought
by the forgiving of all sins; but the second cure is to heal the
infirmity itself, and this takes place gradually by making progress
in the renewal of that image: which two things are plainly shown in

eternal, from things visible to things intelligible, from things

Son, because He only in the Trinity took a body, in which He died
and rose again, and which He carried with Him to heaven above. For
this, too, is called an image of the Son of God, in which we shall

which I believe is properly called wisdom as distinct from
knowledge in the sacred writings; but wisdom only of man, which yet
man has not except from Him, by partaking of whom a rational and
intellectual mind can be made truly wise;&#8212;this contemplative
wisdom, I say, it is that Cicero commends, in the end of the
dialogue <i>Hortensius</i>, when he says: &#8220;While, then, we
consider these things night and day, and sharpen our understanding,
which is the eye of the mind, taking care that it be not ever
dulled, that is, while we live in philosophy; we, I say, in so
doing, have great hope that, if, on the one hand, this sentiment
and wisdom of ours is mortal and perishable, we shall still, when
we have discharged our human offices, have a pleasant setting, and
a not painful extinction, and as it were a rest from life: or if,
on the other, as ancient philosophers thought,&#8212;and those, too,
the greatest and far the most celebrated,&#8212;we have souls eternal
and divine, then must we needs think, that the more these shall
have always kept in their own proper course, <i>i.e.</i> in reason
and in the desire of inquiry, and the less they shall have mixed
and entangled themselves in the vices and errors of men, the more
easy ascent and return they will have to heaven.&#8221; And then he
says, adding this short sentence, and finishing his discourse by
repeating it: &#8220;Wherefore, to end my discourse at last, if we wish
either for a tranquil extinction, after living in the pursuit of
these subjects, or if to migrate without delay from this present
home to another in no little measure better, we must bestow all our
labor and care upon these pursuits.&#8221; And here I marvel, that a
man of such great ability should promise to men living in
philosophy, which makes man blessed by contemplation of truth, &#8220;a
pleasant setting after the discharge of human offices, if this our
sentiment and wisdom is mortal and perishable;&#8221; as if that which
we did not love, or rather which we fiercely hated, were then to
die and come to nothing, so that its setting would be pleasant to
us! But indeed he had not learned this from the philosophers, whom
he extols with great praise; but this sentiment is redolent of that
New Academy, wherein it pleased him to doubt of even <pb n="198" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_198.html" id="iv.i.xvi.xix-Page_198"/>the plainest
things. But from the philosophers that were greatest and far most
celebrated, as he himself confesses, he had learned that souls are
eternal. For souls that are eternal are not unsuitably stirred up
by the exhortation to be found in &#8220;their own proper course,&#8221;
when the end of this life shall have come, <i>i.e.</i> &#8220;in reason
and in the desire of inquiry,&#8221; and to mix and entangle themselves
the less in the vices and errors of men, in order that they may
have an easier return to God. But that course which consists in the
love and investigation of truth does not suffice for the wretched,
<i>i.e.</i> for all mortals who have only this kind of reason, and
are without faith in the Mediator; as I have taken pains to prove,
as much as I could, in former books of this work, especially in the
fourth and thirteenth.</p>

<p class="c38" id="iv.i.xvii-p3">Begins by setting forth briefly and
in sum the contents of the previous fourteen books. The argument is
then shown to have reached so far as to allow of our now inquiring
concerning the Trinity, which is God, in those eternal,
incorporeal, and unchangeable things themselves, in the perfect
contemplation of which a blessed life is promised to us. But this
Trinity, as he shows, is here seen by us as by a mirror and in an
enigma, in that it is seen by means of the image of God, which we
are, as in a likeness that is obscure and hard of discernment. In
like manner, it is shown, that some kind of conjecture and
explanation may be gathered respecting the generation of the divine
Word, from the word of our own mind, but only with difficulty, on
account of the exceeding disparity which is discernible between the
two words; and, again, respecting the procession of the Holy
Spirit, from the love that is joined thereto by the
will.</p>

Desiring</span> to exercise the reader in the things that are made,
in order that he may know Him by whom they are made, we have now
advanced so far as to His image, which is man, in that wherein he
excels the other animals, <i>i.e</i>. in reason or intelligence,
and whatever else can be said of the rational or intellectual soul
that pertains to what is called the mind.<note place="end" n="936" id="iv.i.xvii.i-p2.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.i-p3"> <i>Mens</i> or <i>animus</i>.</p></note> For by this name some Latin

the beast as well. If, then, we seek anything that is above this
nature, and seek truly, it is God,&#8212;namely, a nature not created,
but creating. And whether this is the Trinity, it is now our
business to demonstrate not only to believers, by authority of
divine Scripture, but also to such as understand, by some kind of
reason, if we can. And why I say, if we can, the thing itself will
show better when we have begun to argue about it in our

And yet the prophet Isaiah testifies, that the Lord God can be
found when He is sought, when he says: &#8220;Seek ye the Lord; and as
soon as ye have found Him, call upon Him: and when He has drawn
near to you, let the wicked man forsake his ways, and the
unrighteous man his thoughts.&#8221;<note place="end" n="939" id="iv.i.xvii.ii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.ii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Isa. lv. 6, 7" id="iv.i.xvii.ii-p4.2" parsed="|Isa|55|6|55|7" osisRef="Bible:Isa.55.6-Isa.55.7">Isa. lv. 6, 7</scripRef></p></note> If, then, when sought, He can be

perhaps to be sought even when found? For things incomprehensible
must so be investigated, as that no one may think he has found
nothing, when he has been able to find how incomprehensible that is
which he was seeking. Why then does he so seek, if he comprehends
that which he seeks to be incomprehensible, unless because he may
not give over seeking so long as he makes progress in the inquiry
itself into things <pb n="200" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_200.html" id="iv.i.xvii.ii-Page_200"/>incomprehensible, and becomes
ever better and better while seeking so great a good, which is both
sought in order to be found, and found in order to be sought? For
it is both sought in order that it may be found more sweetly, and
found in order that it may be sought more eagerly. The words of
Wisdom in the book of Ecclesiasticus may be taken in this meaning:

Recapitulation of All the Previous Books.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p2">4. But since the necessities of our
discussion and argument have compelled us to say a great many
things in the course of fourteen books, which we cannot view at
once in one glance, so as to be able to refer them quickly in
thought to that which we desire to grasp, I will attempt, by the
help of God, to the best of my power, to put briefly together,
without arguing, whatever I have established in the several books
by argument as known, and to place, as it were, under one mental
view, not the way in which we have been convinced of each point,
but the points themselves of which we have been convinced; in order
that what follows may not be so far separated from that which
precedes, as that the perusal of the former shall produce
forgetfulness of the latter; or at any rate, if it have produced
such forgetfulness, that what has escaped the memory may be
speedily recalled by re-perusal.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p3">5. In the first book, the unity and
equality of that highest Trinity is shown from Holy Scripture. In
the second, and third, and fourth, the same: but a careful handling
of the question respecting the sending of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit has resulted in three books; and we have demonstrated, that
He who is sent is not therefore less than He who sends because the
one sent, the other was sent; since the Trinity, which is in all
things equal, being also equally in its own nature unchangeable,
and invisible, and everywhere present, works indivisibly. In the
fifth,&#8212;with a view to those who think that the substance of the
Father and of the Son is therefore not the same, because they
suppose everything that is predicated of God to be predicated
according to substance, and therefore contend that to beget and to
be begotten, or to be begotten and unbegotten, as being diverse,
are diverse substances,&#8212;it is demonstrated that not everything
that is predicated of God is predicated according to substance, as
He is called good and great according to substance, or anything
else that is predicated of Him in respect to Himself, but that some
things also are predicated relatively, <i>i.e.</i> not in respect
to Himself, but in respect to something which is not Himself; as He
is called the Father in respect to the Son, or the Lord in respect
to the creature that serves Him; and that here, if anything thus
relatively predicated, <i>i.e.</i> predicated in respect to
something that is not Himself, is predicated also as in time, as,
<i>e.g.</i>, &#8220;Lord, Thou hast become our <pb n="201" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_201.html" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-Page_201"/>refuge,&#8221;<note place="end" n="945" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Ps. xc. 1" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p4.2" parsed="|Ps|90|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.90.1">Ps. xc. 1</scripRef></p></note> then nothing
happens to Him so as to work a change in Him, but He Himself
continues altogether unchangeable in His own nature or essence. In
the sixth, the question how Christ is called by the mouth of the
apostle &#8220;the power of God and the wisdom of God,&#8221;<note place="end" n="946" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 24" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p5.2" parsed="|1Cor|1|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.24">1 Cor. i. 24</scripRef></p></note> is so far
argued that the more careful handling of that question is deferred,
<i>viz</i>. whether He from whom Christ is begotten is not wisdom
Himself, but only the father of His own wisdom, or whether wisdom
begat wisdom. But be it which it may, the equality of the Trinity
became apparent in this book also, and that God was not triple, but
a Trinity; and that the Father and the Son are not, as it were, a
double as opposed to the single Holy Spirit: for therein three are
not anything more than one. We considered, too, how to understand
the words of Bishop Hilary, &#8220;Eternity in the Father, form in the
Image, use in the Gift.&#8221; In the seventh, the question is
explained which had been deferred: in what way that God who begat
the Son is not only Father of His own power and wisdom, but is
Himself also power and wisdom; so, too, the Holy Spirit; and yet
that they are not three powers or three wisdoms, but one power and
one wisdom, as one God and one essence. It was next inquired, in
what way they are called one essence, three persons, or by some
Greeks one essence, three substances; and we found that the words
were so used through the needs of speech, that there might be one
term by which to answer, when it is asked what the three are, whom
we truly confess to be three, <i>viz</i>. Father, and Son, and Holy
Spirit. In the eighth, it is made plain by reason also to those who
understand, that not only the Father is not greater than the Son in
the substance of truth, but that both together are not anything
greater than the Holy Spirit alone, nor that any two at all in the
same Trinity are anything greater than one, nor all three together
anything greater than each severally. Next, I have pointed out,
that by means of the truth, which is beheld by the understanding,
and by means of the highest good, from which is all good, and by
means of the righteousness for which a righteous mind is loved even
by a mind not yet righteous, we might understand, so far as it is
possible to understand, that not only incorporeal but also
unchangeable nature which is God; and by means, too, of love, which
in the Holy Scriptures is called God,<note place="end" n="947" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p6"> <scripRef passage="1 John iv. 16" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p6.2" parsed="|1John|4|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.4.16">1 John iv. 16</scripRef></p></note> by which, first of all, those who
have understanding begin also, however feebly, to discern the
Trinity, to wit, one that loves, and that which is loved, and love.
In the ninth, the argument advances as far as to the image of God,
<i>viz</i>. man in respect to his mind; and in this we found a kind
of trinity, <i>i.e.</i> the mind, and the knowledge whereby the
mind knows itself, and the love whereby it loves both itself and
its knowledge of itself; and these three are shown to be mutually
equal, and of one essence. In the tenth, the same subject is more
carefully and subtly handled, and is brought to this point, that we
found in the mind a still more manifest trinity of the mind, <i>
viz.</i> in memory, and understanding, and will. But since it
turned out also, that the mind could never be in such a case as not
to remember, understand, and love itself, although it did not
always think of itself; but that when it did think of itself, it
did not in the same act of thought distinguish itself from things
corporeal; the argument respecting the Trinity, of which this is an
image, was deferred, in order to find a trinity also in the things
themselves that are seen with the body, and to exercise the
reader&#8217;s attention more distinctly in that. Accordingly, in the
eleventh, we chose the sense of sight, wherein that which should
have been there found to hold good might be recognized also in the
other four bodily senses, although not expressly mentioned; and so
a trinity of the outer man first showed itself in those things
which are discerned from without, to wit, from the bodily object
which is seen, and from the form which is thence impressed upon the
eye of the beholder, and from the purpose of the will combining the
two. But these three things, as was patent, were not mutually equal
and of one substance. Next, we found yet another trinity in the
mind itself, introduced into it, as it were, by the things
perceived from without; wherein the same three things, as it
appeared, were of one substance: the image of the bodily object
which is in the memory, and the form thence impressed when the
mind&#8217;s eye of the thinker is turned to it, and the purpose of the
will combining the two. But we found this trinity to pertain to the
outer man, on this account, that it was introduced into the mind
from bodily objects which are perceived from without. In the
twelfth, we thought good to distinguish wisdom from knowledge, and
to seek first, as being the lower of the two, a kind of appropriate
and special trinity in that which is specially called knowledge;
but that although we have got now in this to something pertaining
to the inner man, yet it is not yet to be either called or thought
an image of God. And this is discussed in the thirteenth book by
the commendation of Christian faith. In the <pb n="202" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_202.html" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-Page_202"/>fourteenth
we discuss the true wisdom of man, <i>viz</i>. that which is
granted him by God&#8217;s gift in the partaking of that very God
Himself, which is distinct from knowledge; and the discussion
reached this point, that a trinity is discovered in the image of
God, which is man in respect to his mind, which mind is &#8220;renewed
in the knowledge&#8221; of God, &#8220;after the image of Him that
created&#8221; man;<note place="end" n="948" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p7"> <scripRef passage="Col. iii. 10" id="iv.i.xvii.iii-p7.2" parsed="|Col|3|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.3.10">Col. iii. 10</scripRef></p></note> &#8220;after His

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.iv-p2">6. Let us, then, now seek the
Trinity which is God, in the things themselves that are eternal,
incorporeal, and unchangeable; in the perfect contemplation of
which a blessed life is promised us, which cannot be other than
eternal. For not only does the authority of the divine books
declare that God is; but the whole nature of the universe itself
which surrounds us, and to which we also belong, proclaims that it
has a most excellent Creator, who has given to us a mind and
natural reason, whereby to see that things living are to be
preferred to things that are not living; things that have sense to
things that have not; things that have understanding to things that
have not; things immortal to things mortal; things powerful to
things impotent; things righteous to things unrighteous; things
beautiful to things deformed; things good to things evil; things
incorruptible to things corruptible; things unchangeable to things
changeable; things invisible to things visible; things incorporeal
to things corporeal; things blessed to things miserable. And hence,
since without doubt we place the Creator above things created, we
must needs confess that the Creator both lives in the highest
sense, and perceives and understands all things, and that He cannot
die, or suffer decay, or be changed; and that He is not a body, but
a spirit, of all the most powerful, most righteous, most beautiful,
most good, most blessed.</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p1.1">Chapter 5.&#8212;How Difficult It
is to Demonstrate the Trinity by Natural Reason.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p2">7. But all that I have said, and
whatever else seems to be worthily said of God after the like
fashion of human speech, applies to the whole Trinity, which is one
God, and to the several Persons in that Trinity. For who would dare
to say either of the one God, which is the Trinity itself, or of
the Father, or Son, or Holy Spirit, either that He is not living,
or is without sense or intelligence; or that, in that nature in
which they are affirmed to be mutually equal, any one of them is
mortal, or corruptible, or changeable, or corporeal? Or is there
any one who would deny that any one in the Trinity is most
powerful, most righteous, most beautiful, most good, most blessed?
If, then, these things, and all others of the kind, can be
predicated both of the Trinity itself, and of each several one in
that Trinity, where or how shall the Trinity manifest itself? Let
us therefore first reduce these numerous predicates to some limited
number. For that which is called life in God, is itself His essence
and nature. God, therefore, does not live, unless by the life which
He is to Himself. And this life is not such as that which is in a
tree, wherein is neither understanding nor sense; nor such as is in
a beast, for the life of a beast possesses the fivefold sense, but
has no understanding. But the life which is God perceives and
understands all things, and perceives by mind, not by body, because
&#8220;God is a spirit.&#8221;<note place="end" n="950" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p3"> <scripRef passage="John iv. 24" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p3.2" parsed="|John|4|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.4.24">John iv. 24</scripRef></p></note> And God does not perceive through a
body, as animals do, which have bodies, for He does not consist of
soul and body. And hence that single nature perceives as it
understands, and understands as it perceives, and its sense and
understanding are one and the same. Nor yet so, that at any time He
should either cease or begin to be; for He is immortal. And it is
not said of Him in vain, that &#8220;He only hath immortality.&#8221;<note place="end" n="951" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p4"> <scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 16" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p4.2" parsed="|1Tim|6|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.16">1 Tim. vi. 16</scripRef></p></note> For
immortality is true immortality in His case whose nature admits no
change. That is also true eternity by which God is unchangeable,
without beginning, without end; consequently also incorruptible. It
is one and the same thing, therefore, to call God eternal, or
immortal, or incorruptible, or unchangeable; and it is likewise one
and the same thing to say that He is living, and that He is
intelligent, that is, in truth, wise. For He did not receive wisdom
whereby to be wise, but He is Himself wisdom. And this is life, and
again is power or might, and yet again beauty, whereby He is called
powerful and beautiful. For what is more powerful and more
beautiful than wisdom, &#8220;which reaches from end to end mightily,
and sweetly disposes all things&#8221;?<note place="end" n="952" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p5"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. viii. 1" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p5.2" parsed="|Wis|8|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.8.1">Wisd. viii. 1</scripRef></p></note> Or do goodness, again, and
righteousness, differ from each other in the nature of God, as they
differ in His works, as though they were two diverse qualities of
God&#8212;goodness one, and righteousness an<pb n="203" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_203.html" id="iv.i.xvii.v-Page_203"/>other?
Certainly not; but that which is righteousness is also itself
goodness; and that which is goodness is also itself blessedness.
And God is therefore called incorporeal, that He may be believed
and understood to be a spirit, not a body.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p6">8. Further, if we say, Eternal,
immortal, incorruptible, unchangeable, living, wise, powerful,
beautiful, righteous, good, blessed spirit; only the last of this
list as it were seems to signify substance, but the rest to signify
qualities of that substance; but it is not so in that ineffable and
simple nature. For whatever seems to be predicated therein
according to quality, is to be understood according to substance or
essence. For far be it from us to predicate spirit of God according
to substance, and good according to quality; but both according to
substance.<note place="end" n="953" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p7"> [In the Infinite Being, qualities
are inseparable from essence; in the finite being, they are
separable. If man or angel ceases to be good, or wise, or
righteous, he does not thereby cease to be man or angel. But if God
should lose goodness, wisdom or righteousness, he would no longer
be God. This is the meaning of Augustin, when he says that
&#8220;goodness&#8221; as well as &#8220;spirit&#8221; must be predicated of God,
&#8220;according to substance&#8221;&#8212;that is, that qualities in God are
<i>essential</i> qualities. They are so one with the essence, that
they are inseparable.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> And so in
like manner of all those we have mentioned, of which we have
already spoken at length in the former books. Let us choose, then,
one of the first four of those in our enumeration and arrangement,
<i>i.e.</i> eternal, immortal, incorruptible, unchangeable; since
these four, as I have argued already, have one meaning; in order
that our aim may not be distracted by a multiplicity of objects.
And let it be rather that which was placed first, <i>viz</i>.
eternal. Let us follow the same course with the four that come
next, <i>viz</i>. living, wise, powerful, beautiful. And since life
of some sort belongs also to the beast, which has not wisdom; while
the next two, <i>viz</i>. wisdom and might, are so compared to one
another in the case of man, as that Scripture says, &#8220;Better is he
that is wise than he that is strong;&#8221;<note place="end" n="954" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p8"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. vi. 1" id="iv.i.xvii.v-p8.2" parsed="|Wis|6|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.6.1">Wisd. vi. 1</scripRef></p></note> and beauty, again, is commonly
attributed to bodily objects also: out of these four that we have
chosen, let Wise be the one we take. Although these four are not to
be called unequal in speaking of God; for they are four names, but
one thing. But of the third and last four,&#8212;although it is the
same thing in God to be righteous that it is to be good or to be
blessed; and the same thing to be a spirit that it is to be
righteous, and good, and blessed; yet, because in men there can be
a spirit that is not blessed, and there can be one both righteous
and good, but not yet blessed; but that which is blessed is
doubtless both just, and good, and a spirit,&#8212;let us rather choose
that one which cannot exist even in men without the three others,
<i>viz</i>. blessed.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p2">9. When, then, we say, Eternal,
wise, blessed, are these three the Trinity that is called God? We
reduce, indeed, those twelve to this small number of three; but
perhaps we can go further, and reduce these three also to one of
them. For if wisdom and might, or life and wisdom, can be one and
the same thing in the nature of God, why cannot eternity and
wisdom, or blessedness and wisdom, be one and the same thing in the
nature of God? And hence, as it made no difference whether we spoke
of these twelve or of those three when we reduced the many to the
small number; so does it make no difference whether we speak of
those three, or of that one, to the singularity of which we have
shown that the other two of the three may be reduced. What fashion,
then, of argument, what possible force and might of understanding,
what liveliness of reason, what sharp-sightedness of thought, will
set forth how (to pass over now the others) this one thing, that
God is called wisdom, is a trinity? For God does not receive wisdom
from any one as we receive it from Him, but He is Himself His own
wisdom; because His wisdom is not one thing, and His essence
another, seeing that to Him to be wise is to be. Christ, indeed, is
called in the Holy Scriptures, &#8220;the power of God, and the wisdom
of God.&#8221;<note place="end" n="955" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 24" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|1|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.24">1 Cor. i. 24</scripRef></p></note> But we have
discussed in the seventh book how this is to be understood, so that
the Son may not seem to make the Father wise; and our explanation
came to this, that the Son is wisdom of wisdom, in the same way as
He is light of light, God of God. Nor could we find the Holy Spirit
to be in any other way than that He Himself also is wisdom, and
altogether one wisdom, as one God, one essence. How, then, do we
understand this wisdom, which is God, to be a trinity? I do not
say, How do we believe this? For among the faithful this ought to
admit no question. But supposing there is any way by which we can
see with the understanding what we believe, what is that
way?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p4">10. For if we recall where it was
in these books that a trinity first began to show itself
<pb n="204" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_204.html" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-Page_204"/>to our
understanding, the eighth book is that which occurs to us; since it
was there that to the best of our power we tried to raise the aim
of the mind to understand that most excellent and unchangeable
nature, which our mind is not. And we so contemplated this nature
as to think of it as not far from us, and as above us, not in
place, but by its own awful and wonderful excellence, and in such
wise that it appeared to be with us by its own present light. Yet
in this no trinity was yet manifest to us, because in that blaze of
light we did not keep the eye of the mind steadfastly bent upon
seeking it; only we discerned it in a sense, because there was no
bulk wherein we must needs think the magnitude of two or three to
be more than that of one. But when we came to treat of love, which
in the Holy Scriptures is called God,<note place="end" n="956" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 John iv. 16" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p5.2" parsed="|1John|4|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.4.16">1 John iv. 16</scripRef></p></note> then a trinity began to dawn upon
us a little, <i>i.e.</i> one that loves, and that which is loved,
and love. But because that ineffable light beat back our gaze, and
it became in some degree plain that the weakness of our mind could
not as yet be tempered to it, we turned back in the midst of the
course we had begun, and planned according to the (as it were) more
familiar consideration of our own mind, according to which man is
made after the image of God,<note place="end" n="957" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p6"> <scripRef passage="Gen. i. 27" id="iv.i.xvii.vi-p6.2" parsed="|Gen|1|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.1.27">Gen. i. 27</scripRef></p></note> in order to relieve our
overstrained attention; and thereupon we dwelt from the ninth to
the fourteenth book upon the consideration of the creature, which
we are, that we might be able to understand and behold the
invisible things of God by those things which are made. And now
that we have exercised the understanding, as far as was needful, or
perhaps more than was needful, in lower things, lo! we wish, but
have not strength, to raise ourselves to behold that highest
Trinity which is God. For in such manner as we see most undoubted
trinities, whether those which are wrought from without by
corporeal things, or when these same things are thought of which
were perceived from without; or when those things which take their
rise in the mind, and do not pertain to the senses of the body, as
faith, or as the virtues which comprise the art of living, are
discerned by manifest reason, and, held fast by knowledge; or when
the mind itself, by which we know whatever we truly say that we
know, is known to itself, or thinks of itself; or when that mind
beholds anything eternal and unchangeable, which itself is
not;&#8212;in such way, then, I say, as we see in all these instances
most undoubted trinities, because they are wrought in ourselves, or
are in ourselves, when we remember, look at, or desire these
things;&#8212;do we, I say, in such manner also see the Trinity that is
God; because there also, by the understanding, we behold both Him
as it were speaking, and His Word, <i>i.e.</i> the Father and the
Son; and then, proceeding thence, the love common to both, namely,
the Holy Spirit? These trinities that pertain to our senses or to
our mind, do we rather see than believe them, but rather believe
than see that God is a trinity? But if this is so, then doubtless
we either do not at all understand and behold the invisible things
of God by those things that are made, or if we behold them at all,
we do not behold the Trinity in them; and there is therein somewhat
to behold, and somewhat also which we ought to believe, even though
not beheld. And as the eighth book showed that we behold the
unchangeable good which we are not, so the fourteenth reminded us
thereof, when we spoke of the wisdom that man has from God. Why,
then, do we not recognize the Trinity therein? Does that wisdom
which God is said to be, not perceive itself, and not love itself?
Who would say this? Or who is there that does not see, that where
there is no knowledge, there in no way is there wisdom? Or are we,
in truth, to think that the Wisdom which is God knows other things,
and does not know itself; or loves other things, and does not love
itself? But if this is a foolish and impious thing to say or
believe, then behold we have a trinity,&#8212;to wit, wisdom, and the
knowledge wisdom has of itself, and its love of itself. For so,
too, we find a trinity in man also, <i>i.e.</i> mind, and the
knowledge wherewith mind knows itself, and the love wherewith it
loves itself.</p>

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xvii.vii-p1.1">Chapter 7.&#8212;That It is Not Easy to Discover the Trinity
that is God from the Trinities We Have Spoken of.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.vii-p2">11. But these three are in such way
in man, that they are not themselves man. For man, as the ancients
defined him, is a rational mortal animal. These things, therefore,
are the chief things in man, but are not man themselves. And any
one person, <i>i.e.</i> each individual man, has these three things
in his mind. But if, again, we were so to define man as to say, Man
is a rational substance consisting of mind and body, then without
doubt man has a soul that is not body, and a body that is not soul.
And hence these three things are not man, but belong to man, or are
in man. If, again, we put aside the body, and think of the soul
by <pb n="205" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_205.html" id="iv.i.xvii.vii-Page_205"/>itself, the mind is somewhat belonging to the soul, as
though its head, or eye, or countenance; but these things are not
to be regarded as bodies. It is not then the soul, but that which
is chief in the soul, that is called the mind. But can we say that
the Trinity is in such way in God, as to be somewhat belonging to
God, and not itself God? And hence each individual man, who is
called the image of God, not according to all things that pertain
to his nature, but according to his mind alone, is one person, and
is an image of the Trinity in his mind. But that Trinity of which
he is the image is nothing else in its totality than God, is
nothing else in its totality than the Trinity. Nor does anything
pertain to the nature of God so as not to pertain to that Trinity;
and the Three Persons are of one essence, not as each individual
man is one person.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.vii-p3">12. There is, again, a wide
difference in this point likewise, that whether we speak of the
mind in a man, and of its knowledge and love; or of memory,
understanding, will,&#8212;we remember nothing of the mind except by
memory, nor understand anything except by understanding, nor love
anything except by will. But in that Trinity, who would dare to say
that the Father understands neither Himself, nor the Son, nor the
Holy Spirit, except by the Son, or loves them except by the Holy
Spirit; and that He remembers only by Himself either Himself, or
the Son, or the Holy Spirit; and in the same way that the Son
remembers neither Himself nor the Father, except by the Father, nor
loves them except by the Holy Spirit; but that by Himself He only
understands both the Father and Son and Holy Spirit: and in like
manner, that the Holy Spirit by the Father remembers both the
Father and the Son and Himself, and by the Son understands both the
Father and the Son and Himself; but by Himself only loves both
Himself and the Father and the Son;&#8212;as though the Father were
both His own memory, and that of the Son and of the Holy Spirit;
and the Son were the understanding of both Himself, and the Father
and the Holy Spirit; but the Holy Spirit were the love both of
Himself, and of the Father and of the Son? Who would presume to
think or affirm this of that Trinity? For if therein the Son alone
understands both for Himself and for the Father and for the Holy
Spirit, we have returned to the old absurdity, that the Father is
not wise from Himself, but from the Son, and that wisdom has not
begotten wisdom, but that the Father is said to be wise by that
wisdom which He begat. For where there is no understanding there
can be no wisdom; and hence, if the Father does not understand
Himself for Himself, but the Son understands for the Father,
assuredly the Son makes the Father wise. But if to God to be is to
be wise, and essence is to Him the same as wisdom, then it is not
the Son that has His essence from the Father, which is the truth,
but rather the Father from the Son, which is a most absurd
falsehood. And this absurdity, beyond all doubt, we have discussed,
disproved, and rejected, in the seventh book. Therefore God the
Father is wise by that wisdom by which He is His own wisdom, and
the Son is the wisdom of the Father from the wisdom which is the
Father, from whom the Son is begotten; whence it follows that the
Father understands also by that understanding by which He is His
own understanding (for he could not be Wise that did not
understand); and that the Son is the understanding of the Father,
begotten of the understanding which is the Father. And this same
may not be unfitly said of memory also. For how is he wise, that
remembers nothing, or does not remember himself? Accordingly, since
the Father is wisdom, and the Son is wisdom, therefore, as the
Father remembers Himself, so does the Son also remember Himself;
and as the Father remembers both Himself and the Son, not by the
memory of the Son, but by His own, so does the Son remember both
Himself and the Father, not by the memory of the Father, but by His
own. Where, again, there is no love, who would say there was any
wisdom? And hence we must infer that the Father is in such way His
own love, as He is His own understanding and memory. And therefore
these three, <i>i.e.</i> memory, understanding, love or will in
that highest and unchangeable essence which is God, are, we see,
not the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, but the Father
alone. And because the Son too is wisdom begotten of wisdom, as
neither the Father nor the Holy Spirit understands for Him, but He
understands for Himself; so neither does the Father remember for
Him, nor the Holy Spirit love for Him, but He remembers and loves
for Himself: for He is Himself also His own memory, His own
understanding, and His own love. But that He is so comes to Him
from the Father, of whom He is born. And because the Holy Spirit
also is wisdom proceeding from wisdom, He too has not the Father
for a memory, and the Son for an understanding, and Himself for
love: for He would not be wisdom if another remembered for Him, and
yet another understood for Him, and He only loved for Himself; but
Himself has all three things, and has them in such way that they
are Him<pb n="206" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_206.html" id="iv.i.xvii.vii-Page_206"/>self. But that He is so comes to Him thence, whence He
proceeds.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.vii-p4">13. What man, then, is there who
can comprehend that wisdom by which God knows all things, in such
wise that neither what we call things past are past therein, nor
what we call things future are therein waited for as coming, as
though they were absent, but both past and future with things
present are all present; nor yet are things thought severally, so
that thought passes from one to another, but all things
simultaneously are at hand in one glance;&#8212;what man, I say, is
there that comprehends that wisdom, and the like prudence, and the
like knowledge, since in truth even our own wisdom is beyond our
comprehension? For somehow we are able to behold the things that
are present to our senses or to our understanding; but the things
that are absent, and yet have once been present, we know by memory,
if we have not forgotten them. And we conjecture, too, not the past
from the future, but the future from the past, yet by all unstable
knowledge. For there are some of our thoughts to which, although
future, we, as it were, look onward with greater plainness and
certainty as being very near; and we do this by the means of memory
when we are able to do it, as much as we ever are able, although
memory seems to belong not to the future, but to the past. And this
may be tried in the case of any words or songs, the due order of
which we are rendering by memory; for we certainly should not utter
each in succession, unless we foresaw in thought what came next.
And yet it is not foresight, but memory, that enables us to foresee
it; for up to the very end of the words or the song, nothing is
uttered except as foreseen and looked forward to. And yet in doing
this, we are not said to speak or sing by foresight, but by memory;
and if any one is more than commonly capable of uttering many
pieces in this way, he is usually praised, not for his foresight,
but for his memory. We know, and are absolutely certain, that all
this takes place in our mind or by our mind; but how it takes
place, the more attentively we desire to scrutinize, the more do
both our very words break down, and our purpose itself fails, when
by our understanding, if not our tongue, we would reach to
something of clearness. And do such as we are, think, that in so
great infirmity of mind we can comprehend whether the foresight of
God is the same as His memory and His understanding, who does not
regard in thought each several thing, but embraces all that He
knows in one eternal and unchangeable and ineffable vision? In this
difficulty, then, and strait, we may well cry out to the living
God, &#8220;Such knowledge is too wonderful for me: it is high, I
cannot attain unto it.&#8221;<note place="end" n="958" id="iv.i.xvii.vii-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.vii-p5"> <scripRef passage="Ps. cxxxix. 6" id="iv.i.xvii.vii-p5.2" parsed="|Ps|139|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.139.6">Ps. cxxxix. 6</scripRef></p></note> For I understand by myself how

this &#8220;glass,&#8221; this assuredly occurs to our minds, that in a
glass nothing is discerned but an image. We have endeavored, then,
so to do; in order that we might see in some way or other by this
image which we are, Him by whom we are made, as by a glass. And
this is intimated also in the words of the same apostle: &#8220;But we
with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are
transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by
the Spirit of the Lord.&#8221;<note place="end" n="962" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p4"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. iii. 18" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p4.2" parsed="|2Cor|3|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.18">2 Cor. iii. 18</scripRef></p></note> &#8220;Beholding as in a glass,&#8221;<note place="end" n="963" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p5"> <i>Speculantes</i></p></note> he has said,
<i>i.e.</i> seeing by means of a glass, not looking from a
watch-tower: an ambiguity that does not exist in the Greek
language, whence the apostolic epistles have been rendered into
Latin. For in Greek, a glass,<note place="end" n="964" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p6"> <i>Speculum</i></p></note> in which the images of things are

height of which we command a more distant view. And it is quite
plain that the apostle, in using the word &#8220;speculantes&#8221; in
respect to the glory of the Lord, meant it to come from
&#8220;speculum,&#8221; not from &#8220;specula.&#8221; But where he says, &#8220;We
are transformed into the same image,&#8221; he assuredly means to speak
of the image of God; and by calling it &#8220;the same,&#8221; he means
that very image which we see in the glass, because that same image
is also the glory of the Lord; as he says elsewhere, &#8220;For a man
indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image
and glory of God,&#8221;<note place="end" n="966" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p8"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 7" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-p8.2" parsed="|1Cor|11|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.7">1 Cor. xi. 7</scripRef></p></note>&#8212;a text already discussed in the
twelfth book. He means, then, by &#8220;We are transformed,&#8221; that we
are changed from one form to another, and that we pass from a form
that is obscure to a form <pb n="207" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_207.html" id="iv.i.xvii.viii-Page_207"/>that is bright: since the
obscure form, too, is the image of God; and if an image, then
assuredly also &#8220;glory,&#8221; in which we are created as men, being
better than the other animals. For it is said of human nature in
itself, &#8220;The man ought not to cover his head, because he is the
image and glory of God.&#8221; And this nature, being the most
excellent among things created, is transformed from a form that is
defaced into a form that is beautiful, when it is justified by its
own Creator from ungodliness. Since even in ungodliness itself, the
more the faultiness is to be condemned, the more certainly is the
nature to be praised. And therefore he has added, &#8220;from glory to
glory:&#8221; from the glory of creation to the glory of justification.
Although these words, &#8220;from glory to glory,&#8221; may be understood
also in other ways;&#8212;from the glory of faith to the glory of
sight, from the glory whereby we are sons of God to the glory
whereby we shall be like Him, because &#8220;we shall see Him as He

<span class="c2" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p1.1">Chapter 9.&#8212;Of the Term
&#8220;Enigma,&#8221; And of Tropical Modes of Speech.</span></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p2">15. What has been said relates to
the words of the apostle, that &#8220;we see now through a glass;&#8221;
but whereas he has added, &#8220;in an enigma,&#8221; the meaning of this
addition is unknown to any who are unacquainted with the books that
contain the doctrine of those modes of speech, which the Greeks
call Tropes, which Greek word we also use in Latin. For as we more
commonly speak of <i>schemata</i> than of figures, so we more
commonly speak of tropes than of modes. And it is a very difficult
and uncommon thing to express the names of the several modes or
tropes in Latin, so as to refer its appropriate name to each. And
hence some Latin translators, through unwillingness to employ a
Greek word, where the apostle says, &#8220;Which things are an
allegory,&#8221;<note place="end" n="968" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p3"> <scripRef passage="Gal. iv. 24" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p3.2" parsed="|Gal|4|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.4.24">Gal. iv. 24</scripRef></p></note> have
rendered it by a circumlocution&#8212;Which things signify one thing by
another. But there are several species of this kind of trope that
is called allegory, and one of them is that which is called enigma.
Now the definition of the generic term must necessarily embrace
also all its species; and hence, as every horse is an animal, but
not every animal is a horse, so every enigma is an allegory, but
every allegory is not an enigma. What then is an allegory, but a
trope wherein one thing is understood from another? as in the
Epistle to the Thessalonians, &#8220;Let us not therefore sleep, as do
others; but let us watch and be sober: for they who sleep, sleep in
the night; and they who are drunken, are drunken in the night: but
let us who are of the day, be sober.&#8221;<note place="end" n="969" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p4"> <scripRef passage="1 Thess. v. 6-8" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p4.2" parsed="|1Thess|5|6|5|8" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.5.6-1Thess.5.8">1 Thess. v. 6&#8211;8</scripRef></p></note> But this allegory is not an enigma.
For here the meaning is patent to all but the very dull; but an
enigma is, to explain it briefly, an obscure allegory, as, <i>
e.g.</i>, &#8220;The horseleech had three daughters,&#8221;<note place="end" n="970" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p5"> <scripRef passage="Prov. xxx. 15" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p5.2" parsed="|Prov|30|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.30.15">Prov. xxx. 15</scripRef></p></note> and other
like instances. But when the apostle spoke of an allegory, he does
not find it in the words, but in the fact; since he has shown that
the two Testaments are to be understood by the two sons of Abraham,
one by a bondmaid, and the other by a free woman, which was a thing
not said, but also done. And before this was explained, it was
obscure; and accordingly such an allegory, which is the generic
name, could be specifically called an enigma.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-p6">16. But because it is not only
those that are ignorant of the books that contain the doctrine of
tropes, who inquire the apostle&#8217;s meaning, when he said that we
&#8220;see now in an enigma,&#8221; but those, too, who are acquainted with
the doctrine, but yet desire to know what that enigma is in which
&#8220;we now see;&#8221; we must find a single meaning for the two
phrases, <i>viz</i>. for that which says, &#8220;we see now through a
glass,&#8221; and for that which adds, &#8220;in an enigma.&#8221; For it makes
but one sentence, when the whole is so uttered, &#8220;We see now
through a glass in an enigma.&#8221; Accordingly, as far as my judgment
goes, as by the word glass he meant to signify an image, so by that
of enigma any likeness you will, but yet one obscure, and difficult
to see through. While, therefore, any likenesses whatever may be
understood as signified by the apostle when he speaks of a glass
and an enigma, so that they are adapted to the understanding of
God, in such way as He can be understood; yet nothing is better
adapted to this purpose than that which is not vainly called His
image. Let no one, then, wonder, that we labor to see in any way at
all, even in that fashion of seeing which is granted to us in this
life, <i>viz</i>. through a glass, in an enigma. For we should not
hear of an enigma in this place if sight were easy. And this is a
yet greater enigma, that we do not see what we cannot but see. For
who does not see his own thought? And yet who does see his own
thought, I do not say with the eye of the flesh, but with the inner
sight itself? Who <pb n="208" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_208.html" id="iv.i.xvii.ix-Page_208"/>does not see it, and who does
see it? Since thought is a kind of sight of the mind; whether those
things are present which are seen also by the bodily eyes, or
perceived by the other senses; or whether they are not present, but
their likenesses are discerned by thought; or whether neither of
these is the case, but things are thought of that are neither
bodily things nor likenesses of bodily things, as the virtues and
vices; or as, indeed, thought itself is thought of; or whether it
be those things which are the subjects of instruction and of
liberal sciences; or whether the higher causes and reasons
themselves of all these things in the unchangeable nature are
thought of; or whether it be even evil, and vain, and false things
that we are thinking of, with either the sense not consenting, or
erring in its consent.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p2">17. But let us now speak of those
things of which we think as known, and have in our knowledge even
if we do not think of them; whether they belong to the
contemplative knowledge, which, as I have argued, is properly to be
called wisdom, or to the active which is properly to be called
knowledge. For both together belong to one mind, and are one image
of God. But when we treat of the lower of the two distinctly and
separately, then it is not to be called an image of God, although
even then, too, some likeness of that Trinity may be found in it;
as we showed in the thirteenth book. We speak now, therefore, of
the entire knowledge of man altogether, in which whatever is known
to us is known; that, at any rate, which is true; otherwise it
would not be known. For no one knows what is false, except when he
knows it to be false; and if he knows this, then he knows what is
true: for it is true that that is false. We treat, therefore, now
of those things which we think as known, and which are known to us
even if they are not being thought of. But certainly, if we would
utter them in words, we can only do so by thinking them. For
although there were no words spoken, at any rate, he who thinks
speaks in his heart. And hence that passage in the book of Wisdom:
&#8220;They said within themselves, thinking not aright.&#8221;<note place="end" n="971" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p3"> <scripRef passage="Wisd. ii. 1" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p3.2" parsed="|Wis|2|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.2.1">Wisd. ii. 1</scripRef></p></note> For the
words, &#8220;They said within themselves,&#8221; are explained by the
addition of &#8220;thinking.&#8221; A like passage to this is that in the
Gospel,&#8212;that certain scribes, when they heard the Lord&#8217;s words
to the paralytic man, &#8220;Be of good cheer, my son, thy sins are
forgiven thee,&#8221; said within themselves, &#8220;This man
blasphemeth.&#8221; For how did they &#8220;say within themselves,&#8221;
except by thinking? Then follows, &#8220;And when Jesus saw their
thoughts, He said, Why think ye evil in your thoughts?&#8221;<note place="end" n="972" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p4"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 9.2-4" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p4.1" parsed="|Matt|9|2|9|4" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.2-Matt.9.4">Matt. ix. 2&#8211;4</scripRef></p></note> So far

is, &#8220;They said, thinking,&#8221; is the same here with, &#8220;They
thought, saying.&#8221; For both there and here it is declared, that
they spake within themselves, and in their own heart, <i>i.e.</i>
spake by thinking. For they &#8220;spake within themselves,&#8221; and it
was said to them, &#8220;What think ye?&#8221; And the Lord Himself says of
that rich man whose ground brought forth plentifully, &#8220;And he
thought within himself, saying.&#8221;<note place="end" n="974" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p5.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p6"> <scripRef passage="Luke xii. 17" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p6.2" parsed="|Luke|12|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.12.17">Luke xii. 17</scripRef></p></note></p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p7">18. Some thoughts, then, are
speeches of the heart, wherein the Lord also shows that there is a
mouth, when He says, &#8220;Not that which entereth into the mouth
defileth a man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, that
defileth a man.&#8221; In one sentence He has comprised two diverse
mouths of the man, one of the body, one of the heart. For
assuredly, that from which they thought the man to be defiled,
enters into the mouth of the body; but that from which the Lord
said the man was defiled, proceedeth out of the mouth of the heart.
So certainly He Himself explained what He had said. For a little
after, He says also to His disciples concerning the same thing:
&#8220;Are ye also yet without understanding? Do ye not understand,
that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and
is cast out into the draught?&#8221; Here He most certainly pointed to
the mouth of the body. But in that which follows He plainly speaks
of the mouth of the heart, where He says, &#8220;But those things which
proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile
the man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,&#8221;<note place="end" n="975" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p8"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 15.10-20" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p8.1" parsed="|Matt|15|10|15|20" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.10-Matt.15.20">Matt. xv. 10&#8211;20</scripRef></p></note> etc. What is
clearer than this explanation? And yet, when we call thoughts
speeches of the heart, it does not follow that they are not also
acts of sight, arising from the sight of knowledge, when they are
true. For when these things are done outwardly by means of the
body, then speech and sight are different things; but when we think
inwardly, the two <pb n="209" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_209.html" id="iv.i.xvii.x-Page_209"/>are one,&#8212;just as sight and
hearing are two things mutually distinct in the bodily senses, but
to see and hear are the same thing in the mind; and hence, while
speech is not seen but rather heard outwardly, yet the inward
speeches, <i>i.e.</i> thoughts, are said by the holy Gospel to have
been seen, not heard, by the Lord. &#8220;They said within themselves,
This man blasphemeth,&#8221; says the Gospel; and then subjoined,
&#8220;And when Jesus saw their thoughts.&#8221; Therefore He saw, what
they said. For by His own thought He saw their thoughts, which they
supposed no one saw but themselves.</p>

before the images of its sounds are considered in thought,&#8212;for
this it is which belongs to no tongue, to wit, of those which are
called the tongues of nations, of which our Latin tongue is

the word which we speak in the heart: which word is neither Greek
nor Latin, nor of any other tongue. But when it is needful to
convey this to the knowledge of those to whom we speak, then some
sign is assumed whereby to signify it. And generally a sound,
sometimes a nod, is exhibited, the former to the ears, the latter
to the eyes, that the word which we bear in our mind may become
known also by bodily signs to the bodily senses. For what is to nod
or beckon, except to speak in some way to the sight? And Holy
Scripture gives its testimony to this; for we read in the Gospel
according to John: &#8220;Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of
you shall betray me. Then the disciples looked one upon another,
doubting of whom He spake. Now there was leaning on Jesus&#8217; breast
one of His disciples whom Jesus loved. Simon Peter therefore
beckons to him, and says to him, Who is it of whom He speaks?&#8221;<note place="end" n="977" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p10.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p11"> <scripRef passage="John xiii. 21-24" id="iv.i.xvii.x-p11.2" parsed="|John|13|21|13|24" osisRef="Bible:John.13.21-John.13.24">John xiii. 21&#8211;24</scripRef></p></note> Here he

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xi-p2">20. Accordingly, the word that
sounds outwardly is the sign of the word that gives light inwardly;
which latter has the greater claim to be called a word. For that
which is uttered with the mouth of the flesh, is the articulate
sound of a word; and is itself also called a word, on account of
that to make which outwardly apparent it is itself assumed. For our
word is so made in some way into an articulate sound of the body,
by assuming that articulate sound by which it may be manifested to
men&#8217;s senses, as the Word of God was made flesh, by assuming that
flesh in which itself also might be manifested to men&#8217;s senses.
And as our word becomes an articulate sound, yet is not changed
into one; so the Word of God became flesh, but far be it from us to
say He was changed into flesh. For both that word of ours became an
articulate sound, and that other Word became flesh, by assuming it,
not by consuming itself so as to be changed into it. And therefore
whoever desires to arrive at any likeness, be it of what sort it
may, of the Word of God, however in many respects unlike, must not
regard the word of ours that sounds in the ears, either when it is
uttered in an articulate sound or when it is silently thought. For
the words of all tongues that are uttered in sound are also
silently thought, and the mind runs over verses while the bodily
mouth is silent. And not only the numbers of syllables, but the
tunes also of songs, since they are corporeal, and pertain to that
sense of the body which is called hearing, are at hand by certain
incorporeal images appropriate to them, to those who think of them,
and who silently revolve all these things. But we must pass by
this, in order to arrive at that word of man, by the likeness of
which, be it of what sort it may, the Word of God may be somehow
seen as in an enigma. Not that word which was spoken to this or
that prophet, and of which it is said, &#8220;Now the word of God grew

see, in whatsoever way we can, by means of this likeness, that Word
of God of which it is said, &#8220;The Word was God;&#8221; of which it is
said, &#8220;All things were made by Him;&#8221; of which it is said,

of man, to the word of the rational animal, to the word of that
image of God, that is not born of God, but made by God; which is
neither utterable in sound nor capable of being thought under the
likeness of sound such as must needs be with the word of any
tongue; but which precedes all the signs by which it is signified,
and is begotten from the knowledge that continues in the mind, when
that same knowledge is spoken inwardly according as it really is.
For the sight of thinking is exceedingly like the sight of
knowledge. For when it is uttered by sound, or by any bodily sign,
it is not uttered according as it really is, but as it can be seen
or heard by the body. When, therefore, that is in the word which is
in the knowledge, then there is a true word, and truth, such as is
looked for from man; such that what is in the knowledge is also in
the word, and what is not in the knowledge is also not in the word.
Here may be recognized, &#8220;Yea, yea; nay, nay.&#8221;<note place="end" n="982" id="iv.i.xvii.xi-p6.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xi-p7"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 5.37" id="iv.i.xvii.xi-p7.1" parsed="|Matt|5|37|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.37">Matt. v. 37</scripRef></p></note> And so this likeness of the image
that is made, approaches as nearly as is possible to that likeness
of the image that is born, by which God the Son is declared to be
in all things like in substance to the Father. We must notice in
this enigma also another likeness of the word of God; <i>viz</i>.
that, as it is said of that Word, &#8220;All things were made by
Him,&#8221; where God is declared to have made the universe by His
only-begotten Son, so there are no works of man that are not first
spoken in his heart: whence it is written, &#8220;A word is the
beginning of every work.&#8221;<note place="end" n="983" id="iv.i.xvii.xi-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xi-p8"> <scripRef passage="Ecclus. xxxvii. 20" id="iv.i.xvii.xi-p8.2" parsed="|Sir|37|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.37.20">Ecclus. xxxvii. 20</scripRef></p></note> But here also, it is when the word
is true, that then it is the beginning of a good work. And a word
is true when it is begotten from the knowledge of working good
works, so that there too may be preserved the &#8220;yea yea, nay
nay;&#8221; in order that whatever is in that knowledge by which we are
to live, may be also in the word by which we are to work, and
whatever is not in the one may not be in the other. Otherwise such
a word will be a lie, not truth; and what comes thence will be a
sin, and not a good work. There is yet this other likeness of the
Word of God in this likeness of our word, that there can be a word
of ours with no work following it, but there cannot be any work
unless a word precedes; just as the Word of God could have existed
though no creature existed, but no creature could exist unless by
that Word by which all things are made. And therefore not God the
Father, not the Holy Spirit, not the Trinity itself, but the Son
only, which is the Word of God, was made flesh; although the
Trinity was the maker: in order that we might live rightly through
our word following and imitating His example, <i>i.e.</i> by having
no lie in either the thought or the work of our word. But this
perfection of this image is one to be at some time hereafter. In
order to attain this it is that the good master teaches us by
Christian faith, and by pious doctrine, that &#8220;with face
unveiled&#8221; from the veil of the law, which is the shadow of things
to come, &#8220;beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,&#8221; <i>

is the very knowledge itself that a man can attain, be he ever so
skillful and learned, by which our thought is formed with truth,
when we speak what we know? For to pass by those things that come
into the mind from the bodily senses, among which so many are
otherwise than they seem to be, that he who is overmuch pressed
down by their resemblance to truth, seems sane to himself, but
really is not <pb n="211" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_211.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xii-Page_211"/>sane;&#8212;whence it is that the

his immediate disciples, who were anti-skeptical; but the new
Academy, to which Augustin has previously referred (XIV. xix. 26).
This was skeptical&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> philosophy
has so prevailed as to be still more wretchedly insane by doubting
all things;&#8212;passing by, then, those things that come into the
mind by the bodily senses, how large a proportion is left of things
which we know in such manner as we know that we live? In regard to
this, indeed, we are absolutely without any fear lest perchance we
are being deceived by some resemblance of the truth; since it is
certain, that he who is deceived, yet lives. And this again is not
reckoned among those objects of sight that are presented from
without, so that the eye may be deceived in it; in such way as it
is when an oar in the water looks bent, and towers seem to move as
you sail past them, and a thousand other things that are otherwise
than they seem to be: for this is not a thing that is discerned by
the eye of the flesh. The knowledge by which we know that we live
is the most inward of all knowledge, of which even the Academic
cannot insinuate: Perhaps you are asleep, and do not know it, and
you see things in your sleep. For who does not know that what
people see in dreams is precisely like what they see when awake?
But he who is certain of the knowledge of his own life, does not
therein say, I know I am awake, but, I know I am alive; therefore,
whether he be asleep or awake, he is alive. Nor can he be deceived
in that knowledge by dreams; since it belongs to a living man both
to sleep and to see in sleep. Nor can the Academic again say, in
confutation of this knowledge: Perhaps you are mad, and do not know
it: for what madmen see is precisely like what they also see who
are sane; but he who is mad is alive. Nor does he answer the
Academic by saying, I know I am not mad, but, I know I am alive.
Therefore he who says he knows he is alive, can neither be deceived
nor lie. Let a thousand kinds, then, of deceitful objects of sight
be presented to him who says, I know I am alive; yet he will fear
none of them, for he who is deceived yet is alive. But if such
things alone pertain to human knowledge, they are very few indeed;
unless that they can be so multiplied in each kind, as not only not
to be few, but to reach in the result to infinity. For he who says,
I know I am alive, says that he knows one single thing. Further, if
he says, I know that I know I am alive, now there are two; but that
he knows these two is a third thing to know. And so he can add a
fourth and a fifth, and innumerable others, if he holds out. But
since he cannot either comprehend an innumerable number by
additions of units, or say a thing innumerable times, he
comprehends this at least, and with perfect certainty, <i>viz</i>.
that this is both true and so innumerable that he cannot truly
comprehend and say its infinite number. This same thing may be
noticed also in the case of a will that is certain. For it would be
an impudent answer to make to any one who should say, I will to be
happy, that perhaps you are deceived. And if he should say, I know
that I will this, and I know that I know it, he can add yet a third
to these two, <i>viz</i>. that he knows these two; and a fourth,
that he knows that he knows these two; and so on <i>ad
infinitum</i>. Likewise, if any one were to say, I will not to be
mistaken; will it not be true, whether he is mistaken or whether he
is not, that nevertheless he does will not to be mistaken? Would it
not be most impudent to say to him, Perhaps you are deceived? when
beyond doubt, whereinsoever he may be deceived, he is nevertheless
not deceived in thinking that he wills not to be deceived. And if
he says he knows this, he adds any number he chooses of things
known, and perceives that number to be infinite. For he who says, I
will not to be deceived, and I know that I will not to be so, and I
know that I know it, is able now to set forth an infinite number
here also, however awkward may be the expression of it. And other
things too are to be found capable of refuting the Academics, who
contend that man can know nothing. But we must restrict ourselves,
especially as this is not the subject we have undertaken in the
present work. There are three books of ours on that subject,<note place="end" n="988" id="iv.i.xvii.xii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xii-p4"> <i>Libri Tres contra
Academicos</i></p></note> written in
the early time of our conversion, which he who can and will read,
and who understands them, will doubtless not be much moved by any
of the many arguments which they have found out against the
discovery of truth. For whereas there are two kinds of knowable
things,&#8212;one, of those things which the mind perceives by the
bodily senses; the other, of those which it perceives by
itself,&#8212;these philosophers have babbled much against the bodily
senses, but have never been able to throw doubt upon those most
certain perceptions of things true, which the mind knows by itself,
such as is that which I have mentioned, I know that I am alive. But
far be it from us to doubt the truth of what we have learned by the
bodily senses; since by them we have learned to know the heaven and
the earth, and those things in them which are known to us, so
far <pb n="212" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_212.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xii-Page_212"/>as He who created both us and them has willed them to be
within our knowledge. Far be it from us too to deny, that we know
what we have learned by the testimony of others: otherwise we know
not that there is an ocean; we know not that the lands and cities
exist which most copious report commends to us; we know not that
those men were, and their works, which we have learned by reading
history; we know not the news that is daily brought us from this
quarter or that, and confirmed by consistent and conspiring
evidence; lastly, we know not at what place or from whom we have
been born: since in all these things we have believed the testimony
of others. And if it is most absurd to say this, then we must
confess, that not only our own senses, but those of other persons
also, have added very much indeed to our knowledge.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xii-p5">22. All these things, then, both
those which the human mind knows by itself, and those which it
knows by the bodily senses, and those which it has received and
knows by the testimony of others, are laid up and retained in the
storehouse of the memory; and from these is begotten a word that is
true when we speak what we know, but a word that is before all
sound, before all thought of a sound. For the word is then most
like to the thing known, from which also its image is begotten,
since the sight of thinking arises from the sight of knowledge;
when it is a word belonging to no tongue, but is a true word
concerning a true thing, having nothing of its own, but wholly
derived from that knowledge from which it is born. Nor does it
signify when he learned it, who speaks what he knows; for sometimes
he says it immediately upon learning it; provided only that the
word is true, <i>i.e.</i> sprung from things that are
known.</p>

of the Difference Between the Knowledge and Word of Our Mind, and

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xiii-p2">But is it so, that God the Father,
from whom is born the Word that is God of God,&#8212;is it so, then,
that God the Father, in respect to that wisdom which He is to
Himself, has learned some things by His bodily senses, and others
by Himself? Who could say this, who thinks of God, not as a
rational animal, but as One above the rational soul? So far at
least as He can be thought of, by those who place Him above all
animals and all souls, although they see Him by conjecture through
a glass and in an enigma, not yet face to face as He is. Is it that
God the Father has learned those very things which He knows, not by
the body, for He has none, but by Himself, from elsewhere from some
one? or has stood in need of messengers or witnesses that He might
know them? Certainly not; since His own perfection enables Him to
know all things that He knows. No doubt He has messengers, <i>
viz</i>. the angels; but not to announce to Him things that He
knows not, for there is nothing He does not know. But their good
lies in consulting the truth about their own works. And this it is
which is meant by saying that they bring Him word of some things,
not that He may learn of them, but they of Him by His word without
bodily sound. They bring Him word, too, of that which He wills,
being sent by Him to whomever He wills, and hearing all from Him by
that word of His, <i>i.e.</i> finding in His truth what themselves
are to do: what, to whom, and when, they are to bring word. For we
too pray to Him, yet do not inform Him what our necessities are.
&#8220;For your Father knoweth,&#8221; says His Word, &#8220;what things ye
have need of, before you ask Him.&#8221;<note place="end" n="989" id="iv.i.xvii.xiii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xiii-p3"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 6.8" id="iv.i.xvii.xiii-p3.1" parsed="|Matt|6|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.8">Matt. vi. 8</scripRef></p></note> Nor did He become acquainted with
them, so as to know them, at any definite time; but He knew
beforehand, without any beginning, all things to come in time, and
among them also both what we should ask of Him, and when; and to
whom He would either listen or not listen, and on what subjects.
And with respect to all His creatures, both spiritual and
corporeal, He does not know them because they are, but they are
because He knows them. For He was not ignorant of what He was about
to create; therefore He created because He knew; He did not know
because He created. Nor did He know them when created in any other
way than He knew them when still to be created, for nothing accrued
to His wisdom from them; but that wisdom remained as it was, while
they came into existence as it was fitting and when it was fitting.
So, too, it is written in the book of Ecclesiasticus: &#8220;All things
are known to Him ere ever they were created: so also after they
were perfected.&#8221;<note place="end" n="990" id="iv.i.xvii.xiii-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xiii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Ecclus. xxiii. 20" id="iv.i.xvii.xiii-p4.2" parsed="|Sir|23|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.23.20">Ecclus. xxiii. 20</scripRef></p></note> &#8220;So,&#8221; he says, not otherwise;
so were they known to Him, both ere ever they were created, and
after they were perfected. This knowledge, therefore, is far unlike
our knowledge. And the knowledge of God is itself also His wisdom,
and His wisdom is itself His essence or substance. Because in the
marvellous simplicity of that nature, it is not one thing to be
wise and another to be, but to be wise is to be; as we have often
said already also in the earlier books. But our knowledge is in
most things <pb n="213" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_213.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xiii-Page_213"/>capable both of being lost and
of being recovered, because to us to be is not the same as to know
or to be wise; since it is possible for us to be, even although we
know not, neither are wise in that which we have learned from
elsewhere. Therefore, as our knowledge is unlike that knowledge of
God, so is our word also, which is born from our knowledge, unlike
that Word of God which is born from the essence of the Father. And
this is as if I should say, born from the Father&#8217;s knowledge,
from the Father&#8217;s wisdom; or still more exactly, from the Father
who is knowledge, from the Father who is wisdom.</p>

from the Father, for to know and to be is there one. And therefore,
as to be is not to the Father from the Son, so neither is to know.
Accordingly, as though uttering Himself, the Father begat the Word
equal to Himself in all things; for He would not have uttered
Himself wholly and perfectly, if there were in His Word anything

Word. And this Word can never have anything false, because it is
unchangeable, as He is from whom it is. For &#8220;the Son can do
nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do.&#8221;<note place="end" n="992" id="iv.i.xvii.xiv-p3.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xiv-p4"> <scripRef passage="John v. 19" id="iv.i.xvii.xiv-p4.2" parsed="|John|5|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.19">John v. 19</scripRef></p></note> Through
power He cannot do this; nor is it infirmity, but strength, by
which truth cannot be false. Therefore God the Father knows all
things in Himself, knows all things in the Son; but in Himself as
though Himself, in the Son as though His own Word which Word is
spoken concerning all those things that are in Himself. Similarly
the Son knows all things, <i>viz</i>. in Himself, as things which
are born of those which the Father knows in Himself, and in the
Father, as those of which they are born, which the Son Himself
knows in Himself. The Father then, and the Son know mutually; but
the one by begetting, the other by being born. And each of them
sees simultaneously all things that are in their knowledge, in
their wisdom, in their essence: not by parts or singly, as though
by alternately looking from this side to that, and from that side
to this, and again from this or that object to this or that object,
so as not to be able to see some things without at the same time
not seeing others; but, as I said, sees all things simultaneously,
whereof there is not one that He does not always see.</p>

which has neither sound nor thought of sound, but is of that thing
in seeing which we speak inwardly, and which therefore belongs to
no tongue; and hence is in some sort like, in this enigma, to that
Word of God which is also God; since this too is born of our
knowledge, in such manner as that also is born of the knowledge of
the Father: such a word, I say, of ours, which we find to be in
some way like that Word, let us not be slow to consider how unlike
also it is, as it may be in our power to utter it.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xv-p2">Is our word, then, born of our
knowledge only? Do we not say many things also that we do not know?
And say them not with doubt, but thinking them to be true; while if
perchance they are true in respect to the things themselves of
which we speak, they are yet not true in respect to our word,
because a word is not true unless it is born of a thing that is
known. In this sense, then, our word is false, not when we lie, but
when we are deceived. And when we doubt, our word is not yet of the
thing of which we doubt, but it is a word concerning the doubt
itself. For although we do not know whether that is true of which
we doubt, yet we do know that we doubt; and hence, when we say we
doubt, we say a word that is true, for we say what we know. And
what, too, of its being possible for us to lie? And when we do,
certainly we both willingly and knowingly have a word that is
false, wherein there is a word that is true, <i>viz</i>. that we
lie, for this we know. And when we confess that we have lied, we
speak that which is true; for we say what we know, for we know that
we lied. But that Word which is God, and can do more than we,
cannot do this. For it &#8220;can do nothing except what it sees the
Father do;&#8221; and it &#8220;speaks not of itself,&#8221; but it has from
the Father all that it <pb n="214" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_214.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xv-Page_214"/>speaks, since the Father speaks
it in a special way; and the great might of that Word is that it
cannot lie, because there cannot be there &#8220;yea and nay,&#8221;<note place="end" n="993" id="iv.i.xvii.xv-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xv-p3"> <scripRef passage="2 Cor. i. 19" id="iv.i.xvii.xv-p3.2" parsed="|2Cor|1|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.1.19">2 Cor. i. 19</scripRef></p></note> but &#8220;yea
yea, nay nay.&#8221; Well, but that is not even to be called a word,
which is not true. I willingly assent, if so it be. What, then, if
our word is true and therefore is rightly called a word? Is it the
case that, as we can speak of sight of sight, and knowledge of
knowledge, so we can speak of essence of essence, as that Word of
God is especially spoken of, and is especially to be spoken of? Why
so? Because to us, to be is not the same as to know; since we know
many things which in some sense live by memory, and so in some
sense die by being forgotten: and so, when those things are no
longer in our knowledge, yet we still are: and while our knowledge
has slipped away and perished out of our mind, we are still
alive.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xv-p4">25. In respect to those things also
which are so known that they can never escape the memory, because
they are present, and belong to the nature of the mind
itself,&#8212;as, <i>e.g.</i>, the knowing that we are alive (for this
continues so long as the mind continues; and because the mind
continues always, this also continues always);&#8212;I say, in respect
to this and to any other like instances, in which we are the rather
to contemplate the image of God, it is difficult to make out in
what way, although they are always known, yet because they are not
always also thought of, an eternal word can be spoken respecting
them, when our word is spoken in our thought. For it is eternal to
the soul to live; it is eternal to know that it lives. Yet it is
not eternal to it to be thinking of its own life, or to be thinking
of its own knowledge of its own life; since, in entering upon this
or that occupation, it will cease to think of this, although it
does not cease from knowing it. And hence it comes to pass, that if
there can be in the mind any knowledge that is eternal, while the
thought of that knowledge cannot be eternal, and any inner and true
word of ours is only said by our thought, then God alone can be
understood to have a Word that is eternal, and co-eternal with
Himself. Unless, perhaps, we are to say that the very possibility
of thought&#8212;since that which is known is capable of being truly
thought, even at the time when it is not being
thought&#8212;constitutes a word as perpetual as the knowledge itself
is perpetual. But how is that a word which is not yet formed in the
vision of the thought? How will it be like the knowledge of which
it is born, if it has not the form of that knowledge, and is only
now called a word because it can have it? For it is much as if one
were to say that a word is to be so called because it can be a
word. But what is this that can be a word, and is therefore already
held worthy of the name of a word? What, I say, is this thing that
is formable, but not yet formed, except a something in our mind,
which we toss to and fro by revolving it this way or that, while we
think of first one thing and then another, according as they are
found by or occur to us? And the true word then comes into being,
when, as I said, that which we toss to and fro by revolving it
arrives at that which we know, and is formed by that, in taking its
entire likeness; so that in what manner each thing is known, in
that manner also it is thought, <i>i.e.</i> is said in this manner
in the heart, without articulate sound, without thought of
articulate sound, such as no doubt belongs to some particular
tongue. And hence if we even admit, in order not to dispute
laboriously about a name, that this something of our mind, which
can be formed from our knowledge, is to be already called a word,
even before it is so formed, because it is, so to say, already
formable, who would not see how great would be the unlikeness
between it and that Word of God, which is so in the form of God, as
not to have been formable before it was formed, or to have been
capable at any time of being formless, but is a simple form, and
simply equal to Him from whom it is, and with whom it is
wonderfully co-eternal?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-p2">Wherefore that Word of God is in
such wise so called, as not to be called a thought of God, lest we
believe that there is anything in God which can be revolved, so
that it at one time receives and at another recovers a form, so as
to be a word, and again can lose that form and be revolved in some
sense formlessly. Certainly that excellent master of speech knew
well the force of words, and had looked into the nature of thought,
who said in his poem, &#8220;And revolves with himself the varying
issues of war,&#8221;<note place="end" n="994" id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-p3"> <i>&#198;n</i>. x. 159, 160.</p></note> <i>i.e.</i>
thinks of them. That Son of God, then, is not called the Thought of
God, but the Word of God. For our own thought, attaining to what we
know, and formed thereby, is our true word. And so the Word of God
ought to be understood without any thought on the part of God, so
that it be understood as the simple <pb n="215" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_215.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-Page_215"/>form itself, but containing
nothing formable that can be also unformed. There are, indeed,
passages of Holy Scripture that speak of God&#8217;s thoughts; but this
is after the same mode of speech by which the forgetfulness of God
is also there spoken of, whereas in strict propriety of language
there is in Him certainly no forgetfulness.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-p4">26. Wherefore, since we have found
now in this enigma so great an unlikeness to God and the Word of
God, wherein yet there was found before some likeness, this, too,
must be admitted, that even when we shall be like Him, when &#8220;we
shall see Him as He is&#8221;<note place="end" n="995" id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-p5"> <scripRef passage="1 John iii. 2" id="iv.i.xvii.xvi-p5.2" parsed="|1John|3|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.3.2">1 John iii. 2</scripRef></p></note> (and certainly he who said this was
aware beyond doubt of our present unlikeness), not even then shall
we be equal to Him in nature. For that nature which is made is ever
less than that which makes. And at that time our word will not
indeed be false, because we shall neither lie nor be deceived.
Perhaps, too, our thoughts will no longer revolve by passing and
repassing from one thing to another, but we shall see all our
knowledge at once, and at one glance. Still, when even this shall
have come to pass, if indeed it shall come to pass, the creature
which was formable will indeed have been formed, so that nothing
will be wanting of that form to which it ought to attain; yet
nevertheless it will not be to be equalled to that simplicity
wherein there is not anything formable, which has been formed or
reformed, but only form; and which being neither formless nor
formed, itself is eternal and unchangeable substance.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p2">27. We have sufficiently spoken of
the Father and of the Son, so far as was possible for us to see
through this glass and in this enigma. We must now treat of the
Holy Spirit, so far as by God&#8217;s gift it is permitted to see Him.
And the Holy Spirit, according to the Holy Scriptures, is neither
of the Father alone, nor of the Son alone, but of both; and so
intimates to us a mutual love, wherewith the Father and the Son
reciprocally love one another. But the language of the Word of God,
in order to exercise us, has caused those things to be sought into
with the greater zeal, which do not lie on the surface, but are to
be scrutinized in hidden depths, and to be drawn out from thence.
The Scriptures, accordingly, have not said, The Holy Spirit is
Love. If they had said so, they would have done away with no small
part of this inquiry. But they have said, &#8220;God is love;&#8221;<note place="end" n="996" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 John iv. 16" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p3.2" parsed="|1John|4|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1John.4.16">1 John iv. 16</scripRef></p></note> so that it
is uncertain and remains to be inquired whether God the Father is
love, or God the Son, or God the Holy Ghost, or the Trinity itself
which is God. For we are not going to say that God is called Love
because love itself is a substance worthy of the name of God, but
because it is a gift of God, as it is said to God, &#8220;Thou art my
patience.&#8221;<note place="end" n="997" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lxxi. 5" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p4.2" parsed="|Ps|71|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.71.5">Ps. lxxi. 5</scripRef></p></note> For this is

said, O Lord my love, or, Thou art my love, or, God my love; but it

does not discern this, must ask understanding from the Lord, not an

clearly.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p9">28. &#8220;God,&#8221; then, &#8220;is love;&#8221;
but the question is, whether the Father, or the Son, or the Holy
Spirit, or the Trinity itself: because the Trinity is not three
Gods, but one God. But I have already argued above in this book,
that the Trinity, which is God, is not so to be understood from
those three things which have been set forth in the trinity of our
mind, as that the Father should be the memory of all three, and the
Son the understanding of all three, and the Holy Spirit the love of
all three; as though the Father should neither understand nor love
for Himself, but the Son should understand for Him, and the Holy
Spirit love for Him, but He Himself should remember only both for
Himself and for them; nor the Son remember nor love for Himself,
but the Father should remember for Him, and the Holy Spirit love
for Him, but He Himself understand only both for Himself and them;
nor likewise that the Holy Spirit should neither remember nor
understand for Himself, but the Father should remember for Him, and
the Son understand for Him, while He Himself should love only both
for Himself and for them; but rather in this way, that both all and
each have all three each in His own nature. Nor that these things
should differ in them, as in us memory is one thing, understanding
another, love or charity another, but should be some one thing that
is <pb n="216" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_216.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-Page_216"/>equivalent to all, as wisdom itself; and should be so
contained in the nature of each, as that He who has it is that
which He has, as being an unchangeable and simple substance. If all
this, then, has been understood, and so far as is granted to us to
see or conjecture in things so great, has been made patently true,
I know not why both the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit
should not be called Love, and all together one love, just as both
the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit is called Wisdom, and
all together not three, but one wisdom. For so also both the Father
is God, and the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God, and all three
together one God.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p10">29. And yet it is not to no purpose
that in this Trinity the Son and none other is called the Word of
God, and the Holy Spirit and none other the Gift of God, and God
the Father alone is He from whom the Word is born, and from whom
the Holy Spirit principally proceeds. And therefore I have added
the word principally, because we find that the Holy Spirit proceeds
from the Son also. But the Father gave Him this too, not as to one
already existing, and not yet having it; but whatever He gave to
the only-begotten Word, He gave by begetting Him. Therefore He so
begat Him as that the common Gift should proceed from Him also, and
the Holy Spirit should be the Spirit of both. This distinction,
then, of the inseparable Trinity is not to be merely accepted in
passing, but to be carefully considered; for hence it was that the
Word of God was specially called also the Wisdom of God, although
both Father and Holy Spirit are wisdom. If, then, any one of the
three is to be specially called Love, what more fitting than that
it should be the Holy Spirit?&#8212;namely, that in that simple and
highest nature, substance should not be one thing and love another,
but that substance itself should be love, and love itself should be
substance, whether in the Father, or in the Son, or in the Holy
Spirit; and yet that the Holy Spirit should be specially called
Love.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p11">30. Just as sometimes all the
utterances of the Old Testament together in the Holy Scriptures are
signified by the name of the Law. For the apostle, in citing a text
from the prophet Isaiah, where he says, &#8220;With divers tongues and
with divers lips will I speak to this people,&#8221; yet prefaced it
by, &#8220;It is written in the Law.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1002" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p12"> <scripRef passage="Isa. xxviii. 11" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p12.2" parsed="|Isa|28|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.28.11">Isa. xxviii. 11</scripRef> and

by Moses is specially called the Law: as it is said, &#8220;The Law and
the Prophets were until John;&#8221;<note place="end" n="1005" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p14.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p15"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 11.13" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p15.1" parsed="|Matt|11|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.13">Matt. xi. 13</scripRef></p></note> and, &#8220;On these two commandments

called the Law which was from Mount Sinai. And the Psalms, too, are
signified under the name of the Prophets; and yet in another place
the Saviour Himself says, &#8220;All things must needs be fulfilled,
which are written in the Law, and the Prophets, and the Psalms
concerning me.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1007" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p17"> <scripRef passage="Luke xxiv. 44" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p17.2" parsed="|Luke|24|44|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.24.44">Luke xxiv. 44</scripRef></p></note> Here, on the other side, He meant
the name of Prophets to be taken as not including the Psalms.
Therefore the Law with the Prophets and the Psalms taken together
is called the Law universally, and the Law is also specially so
called which was given by Moses. Likewise the Prophets are so
called in common together with the Psalms, and they are also
specially so called exclusive of the Psalms. And many other
instances might be adduced to teach us, that many names of things
are both put universally, and also specially applied to particular
things, were it not that a long discourse is to be avoided in a
plain case. I have said so much, lest any one should think that it
was therefore unsuitable for us to call the Holy Spirit Love,
because both God the Father and God the Son can be called
Love.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p18">31. As, then, we call the only Word
of God specially by the name of Wisdom, although universally both
the Holy Spirit and the Father Himself is wisdom; so the Holy
Spirit is specially called by the name of Love, although
universally both the Father and the Son are love. But the Word of
God, <i>i.e.</i> the only-begotten Son of God, is expressly called
the Wisdom of God by the mouth of the apostle, where he says,
&#8220;Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1008" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p19"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 24" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p19.2" parsed="|1Cor|1|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.24">1 Cor. i. 24</scripRef></p></note> But where
the Holy Spirit is called Love, is to be found by careful scrutiny
of the language of John the apostle, who, after saying, &#8220;Beloved,
let us love one another, for love is of God,&#8221; has gone on to say,
&#8220;And every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He
that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.&#8221; Here,
manifestly, he has called that love God, which he said was of God;
therefore God of God is love. But because both the Son is born of
God the Father, and the Holy Spirit proceeds from God the Father,
it is rightly asked which of them we ought here to think is the
rather called the love that is God. For the Father only is so God
as not to be of God; and hence the love that is so God as to be of
God, is either the Son or the Holy Spirit. But when, in what

that by which we love Him, but that by which He &#8220;loved us, and

thereupon had exhorted us also to love one another, and that so God
would abide in us,&#8212;because, namely, he had called God Love;
immediately, in his wish to speak yet more expressly on the
subject, &#8220;Hereby,&#8221; he says, &#8220;know we that we dwell in Him,
and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit.&#8221; Therefore
the Holy Spirit, of whom He hath given us, makes us to abide in
God, and Him in us; and this it is that love does. Therefore He is
the God that is love. Lastly, a little after, when he had repeated
the same thing, and had said &#8220;God is love,&#8221; he immediately
subjoined, &#8220;And he who abideth in love, abideth in God, and God
abideth in him;&#8221; whence he had said above, &#8220;Hereby we know that
we abide in Him, and He in us, because He hath given us of His
Spirit.&#8221; He therefore is signified, where we read that God is
love. Therefore God the Holy Spirit, who proceedeth from the
Father, when He has been given to man, inflames him to the love of
God and of his neighbor, and is Himself love. For man has not
whence to love God, unless from God; and therefore he says a little
after, &#8220;Let us love Him, because He first loved us.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1010" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p20.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p21"> <scripRef passage="1 John iv. 7-19" id="iv.i.xvii.xvii-p21.2" parsed="|1John|4|7|4|19" osisRef="Bible:1John.4.7-1John.4.19">1 John iv. 7&#8211;19</scripRef></p></note> The

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xviii-p2">32. There is no gift of God more
excellent than this. It alone distinguishes the sons of the eternal
kingdom and the sons of eternal perdition. Other gifts, too, are
given by the Holy Spirit; but without love they profit nothing.
Unless, therefore, the Holy Spirit is so far imparted to each, as
to make him one who loves God and his neighbor, he is not removed
from the left hand to the right. Nor is the Spirit specially called
the Gift, unless on account of love. And he who has not this love,
&#8220;though he speak with the tongues of men and angels, is sounding
brass and a tinkling cymbal; and though he have the gift of
prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and though he
have all faith, so that he can remove mountains, he is nothing; and
though he bestow all his goods to feed the poor, and though he give
his body to be burned, it profiteth him nothing.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1012" id="iv.i.xvii.xviii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xviii-p3"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiii. 1-3" id="iv.i.xvii.xviii-p3.2" parsed="|1Cor|13|1|13|3" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.1-1Cor.13.3">1 Cor. xiii. 1&#8211;3</scripRef></p></note> How great
a good, then, is that without which goods so great bring no one to
eternal life! But love or charity itself,&#8212;for they are two names
for one thing,&#8212;if he have it that does not speak with tongues,
nor has the gift of prophecy, nor knows all mysteries and all
knowledge, nor gives all his goods to the poor, either because he
has none to give or because some necessity hinders, nor delivers
his body to be burned, if no trial of such a suffering overtakes
him, brings that man to the kingdom, so that faith itself is only
rendered profitable by love, since faith without love can indeed
exist, but cannot profit. And therefore also the Apostle Paul says,
&#8220;In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor
uncircumcision, but faith that worketh by love:&#8221;<note place="end" n="1013" id="iv.i.xvii.xviii-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xviii-p4"> <scripRef passage="Gal. v. 6" id="iv.i.xvii.xviii-p4.2" parsed="|Gal|5|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.5.6">Gal. v. 6</scripRef></p></note> so

and is God, is specially the Holy Spirit, by whom the love of God
is shed abroad in our hearts, by which love the whole Trinity
dwells in us. And therefore most rightly is the Holy Spirit,

properly be understood except love, which brings to God, and

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p2">33. Is this too to be proved, that
the Holy Spirit is called in the sacred books the gift of God? If
people look for this too, we have in the Gospel according to John
the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, who says, &#8220;If any one thirst,
let him come to me and drink: he that believeth on me, as the
Scripture saith, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
water.&#8221; And the evangelist has gone on further to add, &#8220;And
this He spake of the Spirit, which they should receive who believe
in Him.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1016" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p3"> <scripRef passage="John vii. 37-39" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p3.2" parsed="|John|7|37|7|39" osisRef="Bible:John.7.37-John.7.39">John vii. 37&#8211;39</scripRef></p></note> And hence
Paul the apostle also says, &#8220;And we have all been made to drink
into one Spirit.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1017" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p3.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p4"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xii. 13" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p4.2" parsed="|1Cor|12|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.13">1 Cor. xii. 13</scripRef></p></note> The question then is, whether that
water is called the gift of God which is the Holy Spirit. But as we
find here that this water is the Holy Spirit, so we find elsewhere
in the Gospel itself that this water is called the gift of God. For
when the same Lord was talking with the woman of Samaria at the
well, to whom He had said, &#8220;Give me 
<pb n="218" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_218.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-Page_218"/>to drink,&#8221; and she had
answered that the Jews &#8220;have no dealings&#8221; with the Samaritans,
Jesus answered and said unto her, &#8220;If thou hadst known the gift
of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou
wouldest have asked of Him, and He would have given thee living
water. The woman saith unto Him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw
with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou this living
water, etc.? Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that
drinketh of this water shall thirst again; but whose shall drink of
the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water
that I shall give him, shall be in him a fountain of water
springing up unto eternal life.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1018" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p5"> <scripRef passage="John iv. 7-14" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p5.2" parsed="|John|4|7|4|14" osisRef="Bible:John.4.7-John.4.14">John iv. 7&#8211;14</scripRef></p></note> Because this living water, then,
as the evangelist has explained to us, is the Holy Spirit, without
doubt the Spirit is the gift of God, of which the Lord says here,
&#8220;If thou hadst known the gift of God, and who it is that saith
unto thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of Him, and
He would have given thee living water.&#8221; For that which is in the
one passage, &#8220;Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
water,&#8221; is in the other, &#8220;shall be in him a fountain of water
springing up unto eternal life.&#8221;</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p6">34. Paul the apostle also says,
&#8220;To each of us is given grace according to the measure of the
gift of Christ;&#8221; and then, that he might show that by the gift of
Christ he meant the Holy Spirit, he has gone on to add,
&#8220;Wherefore He saith, He hath ascended up on high, He hath led
captivity captive, and hath given gifts to men.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1019" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p7"> <scripRef passage="Eph. iv. 7, 8" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p7.2" parsed="|Eph|4|7|4|8" osisRef="Bible:Eph.4.7-Eph.4.8">Eph. iv. 7, 8</scripRef></p></note> And every
one knows that the Lord Jesus, when He had ascended into heaven
after the resurrection from the dead, gave the Holy Spirit, with
whom they who believed were filled, and spake with the tongues of
all nations. And let no one object that he says <i>gifts</i>, not
<i>gift</i>: for he quoted the text from the Psalm. And in the
Psalm it is read thus, &#8220;Thou hast ascended up on high, Thou hast
led captivity captive, Thou hast received gifts in men.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1020" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p8"> <scripRef passage="Ps. lxviii. 18" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p8.2" parsed="|Ps|68|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.68.18">Ps. lxviii. 18</scripRef></p></note> For so it
stands in many <span class="c19" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p8.3">mss</span>., especially in the Greek <span class="c19" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p8.4">
mss</span>., and so we have it translated from the
Hebrew. The apostle therefore said <i>gifts</i>, as the prophet
did, not <i>gift</i>. But whereas the prophet said, &#8220;Thou hast
received gifts in men,&#8221; the apostle has preferred saying, &#8220;He
gave gifts to men:&#8221; and this in order that the fullest sense may
be gathered from both expressions, the one prophetic, the other
apostolic; because both possess the authority of a divine
utterance. For both are true, as well that He gave to men, as that
He received in men. He gave to men, as the head to His own members:
He Himself that gave, received in men, no doubt as in His own
members; on account of which, namely, His own members, He cried
from heaven, &#8220;Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?&#8221;<note place="end" n="1021" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p8.5"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p9"> <scripRef passage="Acts ix. 4" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p9.2" parsed="|Acts|9|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.9.4">Acts ix. 4</scripRef></p></note> And of
which, namely, His own members, He says, &#8220;Since ye have done it
to one of the least of these that are mine, ye have done it unto
me.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1022" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p9.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p10"> <scripRef passage="Matt. 25.40" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p10.1" parsed="|Matt|25|40|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.40">Matt. xxv. 40</scripRef></p></note> Christ
Himself, therefore, both gave from heaven and received on earth.
And further, both prophet and apostle have said gifts for this
reason, because many gifts, which are proper to each, are divided
in common to all the members of Christ, by the Gift, which is the
Holy Spirit. For each severally has not all, but some have these
and some have those; although all have the Gift itself by which
that which is proper to each is divided to Him, <i>i.e.</i> the
Holy Spirit. For elsewhere also, when he had mentioned many gifts,
&#8220;All these,&#8221; he says, &#8220;worketh that one and the self-same
Spirit, dividing to each severally as He will.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1023" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p11"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xii. 11" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p11.2" parsed="|1Cor|12|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.11">1 Cor. xii. 11</scripRef></p></note> And this
word is found also in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where it is
written, &#8220;God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders,
and with divers miracles, and gifts<note place="end" n="1024" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p11.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p12"> <i>

here, when he had said, &#8220;He ascended up on high, He led captivity
captive, He gave gifts to men,&#8221; he says further, &#8220;But that He
ascended, what is it but that He also first descended into the
lower parts of the earth? He who descended is the same also that
ascended up far above all heavens, that He might fill all things.
And He gave some apostles, some prophets, and some evangelists, and
some pastors and doctors.&#8221; (This we see is the reason why gifts
are spoken of; because, as he says elsewhere, &#8220;Are all apostles?
are all prophets?&#8221;<note place="end" n="1026" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p13.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p14"> <scripRef passage="1 Cor. xii. 29" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p14.2" parsed="|1Cor|12|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.29">1 Cor. xii. 29</scripRef></p></note> etc.) And here he has added,

house is called His Church, is built up of those who have been
rescued from the devil, by whom they were held captive. But He
Himself led this captivity captive, who conquered the devil. And
that he might not draw with him into eternal punishment those who
were to become the members of the Holy Head, He bound him first by
the bonds of righteousness, and then by those of might. The devil
himself, there<pb n="219" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_219.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-Page_219"/>fore, is called captivity,
which He led captive who ascended up on high, and gave gifts to
men, or received gifts in men.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p17">35. And Peter the apostle, as we
read in that canonical book, wherein the Acts of the Apostles are
recorded,&#8212;when the hearts of the Jews were troubled as he spake
of Christ, and they said, &#8220;Brethren, what shall we do? tell
us,&#8221;&#8212;said to them, &#8220;Repent, and be baptized every one of you
in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins:

read likewise in the same book, that Simon Magus desired to give
money to the apostles, that he might receive power from them,
whereby the Holy Spirit might be given by the laying on of his
hands. And the same Peter said to him, &#8220;Thy money perish with
thee: because thou hast thought to purchase for money the gift of
God.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1030" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p18.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p19"> <scripRef passage="Acts viii. 18-20" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p19.2" parsed="|Acts|8|18|8|20" osisRef="Bible:Acts.8.18-Acts.8.20">Acts viii. 18&#8211;20</scripRef></p></note> And in
another place of the same book, when Peter was speaking to
Cornelius, and to those who were with him, and was announcing and
preaching Christ, the Scripture says, &#8220;While Peter was still
speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all them that heard
the word; and they of the circumcision that believed, as many as
came with Peter, were astonished, because that upon the Gentiles
also the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out. For they heard
them speak with tongues, and magnify God.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1031" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p19.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p20"> <scripRef passage="Acts x. 44, 46" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p20.2" parsed="|Acts|10|44|0|0;|Acts|10|46|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.10.44 Bible:Acts.10.46">Acts x. 44, 46</scripRef></p></note> And when Peter afterwards was
giving an account to the brethren that were at Jerusalem of this
act of his, that he had baptized those who were not circumcised,
because the Holy Spirit, to cut the knot of the question, had come
upon them before they were baptized, and the brethren at Jerusalem
were moved when they heard it, he says, after the rest of his
words, &#8220;And when I began to speak to them, the Holy Spirit fell
upon them, as upon us in the beginning. And I remembered the word
of the Lord, how He said, that John indeed baptized with water, but
ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit. If, therefore, He gave a
like gift to them, as also to us who believed in the Lord Jesus
Christ, who was I, that I could hinder God from giving to them the
Holy Spirit?&#8221;<note place="end" n="1032" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p20.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p21"> <scripRef passage="Acts xi. 15-17" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p21.2" parsed="|Acts|11|15|11|17" osisRef="Bible:Acts.11.15-Acts.11.17">Acts xi. 15&#8211;17</scripRef></p></note> And there
are many other testimonies of the Scriptures, which unanimously
attest that the Holy Spirit is the gift of God, in so far as He is
given to those who by Him love God. But it is too long a task to
collect them all. And what is enough to satisfy those who are not
satisfied with those we have alleged?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p22">36. Certainly they must be warned,
since they now see that the Holy Spirit is called the gift of God,
that when they hear of &#8220;the gift of the Holy Spirit,&#8221; they
should recognize therein that mode of speech which is found in the
words, &#8220;In the spoiling of the body of the flesh.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1033" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p23"> <scripRef passage="Col. ii. 11" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p23.2" parsed="|Col|2|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.2.11">Col. ii. 11</scripRef></p></note> For as the
body of the flesh is nothing else but the flesh, so the gift of the
Holy Spirit is nothing else but the Holy Spirit. He is then the
gift of God, so far as He is given to those to whom He is given.
But in Himself He is God, although He were given to no one, because
He was God co-eternal with the Father and the Son before He was
given to any one. Nor is He less than they, because they give, and
He is given. For He is given as a gift of God in such way that He
Himself also gives Himself as being God. For He cannot be said not
to be in His own power, of whom it is said, &#8220;The Spirit bloweth
where it listeth;&#8221;<note place="end" n="1034" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p23.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p24"> <scripRef passage="John iii. 6" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p24.2" parsed="|John|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.3.6">John iii. 6</scripRef></p></note> and the apostle says, as I have
already mentioned above, &#8220;All these things worketh that selfsame
Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will.&#8221; We have not
here the creating of Him that is given, and the rule of them that
give, but the concord of the given and the givers.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p25">37. Wherefore, if Holy Scripture
proclaims that God is love, and that love is of God, and works this
in us that we abide in God and He in us, and that hereby we know
this, because He has given us of His Spirit, then the Spirit
Himself is God, who is love. Next, if there be among the gifts of
God none greater than love, and there is no greater gift of God
than the Holy Spirit, what follows more naturally than that He is
Himself love, who is called both God and of God? And if the love by
which the Father loves the Son, and the Son loves the Father,
ineffably demonstrates the communion of both, what is more suitable
than that He should be specially called love, who is the Spirit
common to both? For this is the sounder thing both to believe and
to understand, that the Holy Spirit is not alone love in that
Trinity, yet is not specially called love to no purpose, for the
reasons we have alleged; just as He is not alone in that Trinity
either a Spirit or holy, since both the Father is a Spirit, and the
Son is a Spirit; and both the Father is holy, and the Son is
holy,&#8212;as piety doubts not. And yet it is not to no purpose that
He is specially called the Holy Spirit; for because He is common to
both, He is specially called that which both are in common.
Otherwise, if in that Trinity the Holy Spirit alone is love, then
doubtless the Son too turns out to be the Son, not of the Father
only, but also of the Holy <pb n="220" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_220.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-Page_220"/>Spirit. For He is both said and
read in countless places to be so,&#8212;the only-begotten Son of God
the Father; as that what the apostle says of God the Father is true
too: &#8220;Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath
translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His own love.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1035" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p26"> <scripRef passage="Col. i. 13" id="iv.i.xvii.xix-p26.2" parsed="|Col|1|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.1.13">Col. i. 13</scripRef></p></note> He did not
say, &#8220;of His own Son.&#8221; If He had so said, He would have said it
most truly, just as He did say it most truly, because He has often
said it; but He says, &#8220;the Son of His own love.&#8221; Therefore He
is the Son also of the Holy Spirit, if there is in that Trinity no
love in God except the Holy Spirit. And if this is most absurd, it
remains that the Holy Spirit is not alone therein love, but is
specially so called for the reasons I have sufficiently set forth;
and that the words, &#8220;Son of His own love,&#8221; mean nothing else
than His own beloved Son,&#8212;the Son, in short, of His own
substance. For the love in the Father, which is in His ineffably
simple nature, is nothing else than His very nature and substance
itself,&#8212;as we have already often said, and are not ashamed of
often repeating. And hence the &#8220;Son of His love,&#8221; is none other
than He who is born of His substance.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xx-p2">38. Wherefore the logic of
Eunomius, from whom the Eunomian heretics sprang, is ridiculous.
For when he could not understand, and would not believe, that the
only-begotten Word of God, by which all things were made is the Son
of God by nature,&#8212;<i>i.e.</i> born of the substance of the
Father,&#8212;he alleged that He was not the Son of His own nature or
substance or essence, but the Son of the will of God; so as to mean
to assert that the will by which he begot the Son was something
accidental [and optional] to God,&#8212;to wit, in that way that we
ourselves sometimes will something which before we did not will, as
though it was not for these very things that our nature is
perceived to be changeable,&#8212;a thing which far be it from us to
believe of God. For it is written, &#8220;Many are the thoughts in the
heart of man, but the counsel of the Lord abideth for ever,&#8221;<note place="end" n="1036" id="iv.i.xvii.xx-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xx-p3"> <scripRef passage="Prov. xix. 21" id="iv.i.xvii.xx-p3.2" parsed="|Prov|19|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.19.21">Prov. xix. 21</scripRef></p></note> for no
other reason except that we may understand or believe that as God
is eternal, so is His counsel for eternity, and therefore
unchangeable, as He himself is. And what is said of thoughts can
most truly be said also of the will: there are many wills in the
heart of man, but the will of the Lord abideth for ever. Some,
again, to escape saying that the only-begotten Word is the Son of
the counsel or will of God, have affirmed the same Word to be the
counsel or will itself of the Father. But it is better in my
judgment to say counsel of counsel, and will of will, as substance
of substance, wisdom of wisdom, that we may not be led into that
absurdity, which we have refuted already, and say that the Son
makes the Father wise or willing, if the Father has not in His own
substance either counsel or will. It was certainly a sharp answer
that somebody gave to the heretic, who most subtly asked him
whether God begat the Son willingly or unwillingly, in order that
if he said unwillingly, it would follow most absurdly that God was
miserable; but if willingly, he would forthwith infer, as though by
an invincible reason, that at which he was aiming, <i>viz</i>. that
He was the Son, not of His nature, but of His will. But that other,
with great wakefulness, demanded of him in turn, whether God the
Father was God willingly or unwillingly; in order that if he
answered unwillingly, that misery would follow, which to believe of
God is sheer madness; and if he said willingly, it would be replied
to him, Then He is God too by His own will, not by His nature. What
remained, then, except that he should hold his peace, and discern
that he was himself bound by his own question in an insoluble bond?
But if any person in the Trinity is also to be specially called the
will of God, this name, like love, is better suited to the Holy
Spirit; for what else is love, except will?</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xx-p4">39. I see that my argument in this
book respecting the Holy Spirit, according to the Holy Scripture,
is quite enough for faithful men who know already that the Holy
Spirit is God, and not of another substance, nor less than the
Father and the Son,&#8212;as we have shown to be true in the former
books, according to the same Scriptures. We have reasoned also from
the creature which God made, and, as far as we could, have warned
those who demand a reason on such subjects to behold and understand
His invisible things, so far as they could, by those things which
are made<note place="end" n="1037" id="iv.i.xvii.xx-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xx-p5"> <scripRef passage="Rom. i. 20" id="iv.i.xvii.xx-p5.2" parsed="|Rom|1|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.20">Rom. i. 20</scripRef></p></note> and
especially by the rational or intellectual creature which is made
after the image of God; through which glass, so to say, they might
discern as far as they could, if they could, the Trinity which is
God, in our own memory, understanding, will. Which three things, if
any one intelligently regards as by nature divinely appointed in
his own mind, and remembers by memory, contemplates by <pb n="221" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_221.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xx-Page_221"/>understanding, embraces by love, how great a thing that
is in the mind, whereby even the eternal and unchangeable nature
can be recollected, beheld, desired, doubtless that man finds an
image of that highest Trinity. And he ought to refer the whole of
his life to the remembering, seeing, loving that highest Trinity,
in order that he may recollect, contemplate, be delighted by it.
But I have warned him, so far as seemed sufficient, that he must
not so compare this image thus wrought by that Trinity, and by his
own fault changed for the worse, to that same Trinity as to think
it in all points like to it, but rather that he should discern in
that likeness, of whatever sort it be, a great unlikeness
also.</p>

small a degree soever, by conjecture, in our memory and
understanding, to intimate God the Father and God the Son: <i>
i.e.</i> God the begetter, who has in some way spoken by His own
co-eternal Word all things that He has in His substance; and God
His Word Himself, who Himself has nothing either more or less in
substance than is in Him, who, not lyingly but truly, hath begotten
the Word; and I have assigned to memory everything that we know,
even if we were not thinking of it, but to understanding the
formation after a certain special mode of the thought. For we are
usually said to understand what, by thinking of it, we have found
to be true; and this it is again that we leave in the memory. But
that is a still more hidden depth of our memory, wherein we found
this also first when we thought of it, and wherein an inner word is
begotten such as belongs to no tongue,&#8212;as it were, knowledge of
knowledge, vision of vision, and understanding which appears in
[reflective] thought; of understanding which had indeed existed
before in the memory, but was latent there, although, unless the
thought itself had also some sort of memory of its own, it would
not return to those things which it had left in the memory while it
turned to think of other things.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xxi-p4">41. But I have shown nothing in
this enigma respecting the Holy Spirit such as might appear to be
like Him, except our own will, or love, or affection, which is a
stronger will, since our will which we have naturally is variously
affected, according as various objects are adjacent or occur to it,
by which we are attracted or offended. What, then, is this? Are we
to say that our will, when it is right, knows not what to desire,
what to avoid? Further, if it knows, doubtless then it has a kind
of knowledge of its own, such as cannot be without memory and
understanding. Or are we to listen to any one who should say that
love knows not what it does, which does not do wrongly? As, then,
there are both understanding and love in that primary memory
wherein we find provided and stored up that to which we can come in
thought, because we find also those two things there, when we find
by thinking that we both understand and love anything; which things
were there too when we were not thinking of them: and as there are
memory and love in that understanding, which is formed by thought,
which true word we say inwardly without the tongue of any nation
when we say what we know; for the gaze of our thought does not
return to anything except by remembering it, and does not care to
return unless by loving it: so love, which combines the vision
brought about in the memory, and the vision of the thought formed
thereby, as if parent and offspring, would not know what to love
rightly unless it had a knowledge of what it desired, which it
cannot have without memory and understanding.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xxii-p2">42. But since these are in one
person, as man is, some one may say to us, These three things,
memory, understanding, and love, are mine, not their own; neither
do they do that which they do for themselves, but for me, or rather
I do it by them. For it is I who remember by memory, and understand
by understanding, and love by love: and when I direct the mind&#8217;s
eye to my memory, and so say in my heart the thing I know, and a
true word is begotten of my knowledge, both are mine, both the
knowledge certainly and the word. For it is I who know, and it is I
who say in my heart the thing I know. And when I come to find in my
memory by thinking that I understand and love anything, which
understanding and love were there also before I thought thereon, it
is my own understanding and my own love that I find in my own
memory, whereby it is I that understand, 
<pb n="222" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf103/Page_222.html" id="iv.i.xvii.xxii-Page_222"/>and I that love, not
those things themselves. Likewise, when my thought is mindful, and
wills to return to those things which it had left in the memory,
and to understand and behold them, and say them inwardly, it is my
own memory that is mindful, and it is my own, not its will,
wherewith it wills. When my very love itself, too, remembers and
understands what it ought to desire and what to avoid, it remembers
by my, not by its own memory; and understands that which it
intelligently loves by my, not by its own, understanding. In brief,
by all these three things, it is I that remember, I that
understand, I that love, who am neither memory, nor understanding,
nor love, but who have them. These things, then, can be said by a
single person, which has these three, but is not these three. But
in the simplicity of that Highest Nature, which is God, although
there is one God, there are three persons, the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xxiii-p2">43. A thing itself, then, which is
a trinity is different from the image of a trinity in some other
thing; by reason of which image, at the same time that also in
which these three things are is called an image; just as both the
panel, and the picture painted on it, are at the same time called
an image; but by reason of the picture painted on it, the panel
also is called by the name of image. But in that Highest Trinity,
which is incomparably above all things, there is so great an
indivisibility, that whereas a trinity of men cannot be called one
man, in that, there both is said to be and is one God, nor is that
Trinity in one God, but it is one God. Nor, again, as that image in
the case of man has these three things but is one person, so is it
with the Trinity; but therein are three persons, the Father of the
Son, and the Son of the Father, and the Spirit of both Father and
Son. For although the memory in the case of man, and especially
that memory which beasts have not&#8212;<i>viz</i>. the memory by which
things intelligible are so contained as that they have not entered
that memory through the bodily senses<note place="end" n="1039" id="iv.i.xvii.xxiii-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xxiii-p3"> [The reader will observe that
Augustin has employed the term &#8220;memory&#8221; in a wider sense than
in the modern ordinary use. With him, it is the mind as including
all that is potential or latent in it. The innate ideas, in this
use, are laid up in the &#8220;memory,&#8221; and called into consciousness
or &#8220;remembered&#8221; by reflection. The idea of God, for example, is
not in the &#8220;memory&#8221; when not elicited by reflection. The same
is true of the ideas of space and time, etc.&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note>&#8212;has in this image of the
Trinity, in proportion to its own small measure, a likeness of the
Father, incomparably unequal, yet of some sort, whatever it be: and
likewise the understanding in the case of man, which by the purpose
of the thought is formed thereby, when that which is known is said,
and there is a word of the heart belonging to no tongue, has in its
own great disparity some likeness of the Son; and love in the case
of man proceeding from knowledge, and combining memory and
understanding, as though common to parent and offspring, whereby it
is understood to be neither parent nor offspring, has in that
image, some, however exceedingly unequal, likeness of the Holy
Spirit: it is nevertheless not the case, that, as in that image of
the Trinity, these three are not one man, but belong to one man, so
in the Highest Trinity itself, of which this is an image, these
three belong to one God, but they are one God, and these are three
persons, not one. A thing certainly wonderfully ineffable, or
ineffably wonderful, that while this image of the Trinity is one
person, but the Highest Trinity itself is three persons, yet that
Trinity of three persons is more indivisible than this of one. For
that [Trinity], in the nature of the Divinity, or perhaps better
Deity, is that which it is, and is mutually and always unchangeably
equal: and there was no time when it was not, or when it was
otherwise; and there will be no time when it will not be, or when
it will be otherwise. But these three that are in the inadequate
image, although they are not separate in place, for they are not
bodies, yet are now in this life mutually separate in magnitude.
For that there are therein no several bulks, does not hinder our
seeing that memory is greater than understanding in one man, but
the contrary in another; and that in yet another these two are
overpassed by the greatness of love; and this whether the two
themselves are or are not equal to one another. And so each two by
each one, and each one by each two, and each one by each one: the
less are surpassed by the greater. And when they have been healed
of all infirmity, and are mutually equal, not even then will that
thing which by grace will not be changed, be made equal to that
which by nature cannot change, because the creature cannot be
equalled to the Creator, and when it shall be healed from all
infirmity, will be changed.</p>

Christ, in order to signify this, gave to them the Holy Spirit,

Spirit, at any rate we ought not to doubt that the same Holy Spirit
was given when Jesus breathed upon them, of whom He by and by says,
&#8220;Go, baptize all nations in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Spirit,&#8221; where this Trinity is especially
commended to us. It is therefore He who was also given from heaven
on the day of Pentecost, <i>i.e.</i> ten days after the Lord
ascended into heaven. How, therefore, is He not God, who gives the
Holy Spirit? Nay, how great a God is He who gives God! For no one
of His disciples gave the Holy Spirit, since they prayed that He
might come upon those upon whom they laid their hands: they did not
give Him themselves. And the Church preserves this custom even now
in the case of her rulers. Lastly, Simon Magus also, when he
offered the apostles money, does not say, &#8220;Give me also this
power, that I may give&#8221; the Holy Spirit; but, &#8220;that on

<p class="c10" id="iv.i.xvii.xxvi-p23">47. Are we therefore able to ask
whether the Holy Spirit had already proceeded from the Father when
the Son was born, or had not yet proceeded; and when He was born,
proceeded from both, wherein there is no such thing as distinct
times: just as we have been able to ask, in a case where we do find
times, that the will proceeds from the human mind first, in order
that that may be sought which, when found, may be called offspring;
which offspring being already brought forth or born, that will is
made perfect, resting in this end, so that what had been its desire
when seeking, is its love when enjoying; which love now proceeds
from both, <i>i.e.</i> from the mind that begets, and from the
notion that is begotten, as if from parent and offspring? These
things it is absolutely impossible to ask in this case, where
nothing is begun in time, so as to be perfected in a time
following. Wherefore let him who can understand the generation of
the Son from the Father without time, understand also the
procession of the Holy Spirit from both without time. And let him
who can understand, in that which the Son says, &#8220;As the Father
hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in

&#8220;The Father does not generate the Son either as previously
existing, for in this case there would be no need of generation;
nor yet as not yet existing, for in this case the Son would not be
eternal; but as <i>co-existing</i>, because he is from eternity in
the God-head.&#8221;&#8212;W.G.T.S.]</p></note> let him, I say, understand, that
as the Father has in Himself that the Holy Spirit should proceed
from Him, so has He given to the Son that the same Holy Spirit
should proceed from Him, and be both apart from time: and that the
Holy Spirit is so said to proceed from the Father as that it be
understood that His proceeding also from the Son, is a property
derived by the Son from the Father. For if the Son has of the
Father whatever He has, then certainly He has of the Father, that
the Holy Spirit proceeds also from Him. But let no one think of any
times therein which imply a sooner and a later; because these
things are not there at all. How, then, would it not be most absurd
to call Him the Son of both: when, just as generation from the
Father, without any changeableness of nature, gives to the Son
essence, without beginning of time; so procession from both,
without any changeableness of nature, gives to the Holy Spirit
essence without beginning of time? For while we do not say that the
Holy Spirit is begotten, yet we do not therefore dare to say that
He is unbegotten, lest any one suspect in this word either two
Fathers in that Trinity, or two who are not from another. For the
Father alone is not from another, and therefore He alone is called
unbegotten, not indeed in the Scriptures,<note place="end" n="1068" id="iv.i.xvii.xxvi-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xxvi-p26"> [The term &#8220;unbegotten&#8221; is not

not applied to God in Scripture, but it is implied in the term

who employ such language as they can on so great a subject. And the
Son is born of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeds from the
Father principally, the Father giving the procession without any

the Holy Spirit is not by two separate acts, one of the Father, and
one of the Son&#8212;as perhaps might be inferred from Augustin&#8217;s
remark that &#8220;the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father
principally.&#8221; As Turrettin says: &#8220;The Father and Son spirate
the Spirit, not as two different essences in each of which resides
a spirative energy, but as two personal subsistences of one
essence, who concur in one act of spiration.&#8221; <i>Institutio</i>

would be called the Son of the Father and of the Son, if&#8212;a thing
abhorrent to the feeling of all sound minds&#8212;both had <i>
begotten</i> Him. Therefore the Spirit of both is not begotten of
both, but proceeds from both.</p>

difficult to distinguish generation from procession in that

and indivisible Trinity, let it suffice meanwhile to put before
those who are not able to be drawn on further, what we said upon
this subject in a sermon to be delivered in the ears of Christian
people, and after saying wrote it down. For when, among other
things, I had taught them by testimonies of the Holy Scriptures
that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both, I continue: &#8220;If, then,

therefore, it is His doctrine that is here understood, which yet He
said was not His own, but His that sent Him, how much more is it
there to be understood that the Holy Spirit proceeds also from
Himself, where He so says, He proceedeth from the Father, as not to
say, He proceedeth not from me? From Him, certainly, from whom the
Son had his Divine nature, for He is God of God, He has also, that
from Him too proceeds the Holy Spirit; and hence the Holy Spirit
has from the Father Himself, that He should proceed from the Son
also, as He proceeds from the Father. Here, too, in some way may
this also be understood, so far as it can be understood by such as
we are, why the Holy Spirit is not said to be born, but rather to
proceed;<note place="end" n="1072" id="iv.i.xvii.xxvii-p4.3"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xxvii-p5"> [Generation and procession are
each an emanation of the essence by which it is modified. Neither
of them is a creation <i>ex nihilo</i>. The school-men attempted to
explain the difference between the two emanations, by saying that
the generation of the Son is by the mode of the intellect&#8212;hence
the Son is called Wisdom, or Word (Logos); but the procession of
the Spirit is by the mode of the will&#8212;hence the Spirit is called
Love. Turrettin distinguishes the difference by the following
particulars: 1. In respect to the source. Generation is from the
Father alone; procession is from Father and Son. 2. In respect to
effects. Generation yields not only personality, but resemblance.
The Son is the &#8220;image&#8221; of the Father, but the Spirit is not the
image of the Father and Son. Generation is accompanied with the
power to communicate the essence; procession is not. 3. In respect
to order of relationship. Generation is second, procession is
third. In the order of nature, not of time (for both generation and
procession are eternal, therefore simultaneous), procession is
after generation. <i>Institutio</i> III. xxxi.

He, too, was called a Son, He would certainly be called the Son of
both, which is most absurd, since no one is son of two, save of
father and mother. But far be it from us to surmise any such thing
as this between God the Father and God the Son. Because not even
the son of men proceeds at the same time from both father and
mother; but when he proceeds from the father into the mother, he
does not at that time proceed from the mother; and when he proceeds
from the mother into this present light, he does not at that time
proceed from the father. But the Holy Spirit does not proceed from
the Father into the Son, and from the Son proceed to sanctify the
creature, but proceeds at once from both; although the Father has
given this to the Son, that He should proceed, as from Himself, so
also from Him. For we cannot say that the Holy Spirit is not life,
while the Father is life, and the Son is life: and hence as the
Father, while He has life in Himself, has given also to the Son to
have life in Himself; so has He given also to Him that life should
proceed from Him, as it also proceeds from Himself.&#8221;<note place="end" n="1073" id="iv.i.xvii.xxvii-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iv.i.xvii.xxvii-p6"> Serm. in <i>Joh. Evang.

cross; but unless this be believed which has been so done and seen,
that it is not now to be hoped for as about to be and to be seen,
there is no coming to Christ, such as without end He is to be seen.

that which man himself has in his own nature better than the other
animals, better also than the other parts of his own soul, which is
the mind itself, to which has been assigned a certain sight of
things invisible, and to which, as though honorably presiding in a
higher and inner place, the bodily senses also bring word of all
things, that they may be judged, and than which there is no higher,
to which it is to be subject, and by which it is to be governed,
except God.</p>

then, thou hast seen many things that are true, and hast
distinguished them from that light by the light of which thou hast
seen them. Lift up thine eyes to the light itself, and fix them
upon it if thou canst. For so thou wilt see how the birth of the
Word of God differs from the procession of the Gift of God, on
account of which the only-begotten Son did not say that the Holy
Spirit is begotten of the Father, otherwise He would be His
brother, but that he proceeds from Him. Whence, since the Spirit
of both is a kind of consubstantial communion of Father and Son, He
is not called, far be it from us to say so, the Son of both. But
thou canst not fix thy sight there, so as to discern this lucidly
and clearly; I know thou canst not. I say the truth, I say to
myself, I know what I cannot do; yet that light itself shows to
thee these three things in thyself, wherein thou mayest recognize
an image of the highest Trinity itself, which thou canst not yet
contemplate with steady eye. Itself shows to thee that there is in
thee a true word, when it is born of thy knowledge, <i>i.e.</i>
when we say what we know: although we neither utter nor think of
any articulate word that is significant in any tongue of any
nation, but our thought is formed by that which we know; and there
is in the mind&#8217;s eye of the thinker an image resembling that
thought which the memory contained, will or love as a third
combining these two as parent and offspring. And he who can, sees
and discerns that this will proceeds indeed from thought (for no
one wills that of which he is absolutely ignorant what or of what
sort it is), yet is not an image of the thought: and so that there
is insinuated in this intelligible thing a sort of difference
between birth and procession, since to behold by thought is not the
same as to desire, or even to enjoy will. Thou, too, hast been able
[to discern this], although thou hast not been, neither art, able
to unfold with adequate speech what, amidst the clouds of bodily
likenesses, which cease not to flit up and down before human
thoughts, thou hast scarcely seen. But that light which is not
thyself shows thee this too, that these incorporeal likenesses of
bodies are different from the truth, which, by rejecting them, we
contemplate with the understanding. These, and other things
similarly certain, that light hath shown to thine inner eyes. What
reason, then, is there why thou canst not see that light itself
with steady eye, except certainly infirmity? And what has produced
this in thee, except iniquity? Who, then, is it that healeth all
thine infirmities, unless it be He that forgiveth all thine
iniquities? And therefore I will now at length finish this book by
a prayer better than by an argument.</p>

Thee, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. For the Truth
would not say, Go, baptize all nations in the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, unless Thou wast a Trinity.
Nor wouldest thou, O Lord God, bid us to be baptized in the name of
Him who is not the Lord God. Nor would the divine voice have said,
Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one God, unless Thou wert so a
Trinity as to be one Lord God. And if Thou, O God, wert Thyself the
Father, and wert Thyself the Son, Thy Word Jesus Christ, and the
Holy Spirit your gift, we should not read in the book of truth,

it is in Thy sight, and flying for refuge to Thy mercy; for I am
not silent in thoughts, even when silent in words. And if, indeed,
I thought of nothing save what pleased Thee, certainly I would not
