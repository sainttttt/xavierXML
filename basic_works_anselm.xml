 <description>In this compilation of St. Anselm's most 
important works, St. Anselm uses reason and philosophical 
argument to defend the Christian faith against 
non-believers. St. Anselm stresses the importance of our 
rational nature as humans, encouraging Christians that 
they should be "always ready to convince anyone who 
demands of them a reason of that hope which is in us." In 
his <i>Proslogium</i>, St. Anselm presents the Ontological 
Argument, an argument for the existence of God in which 
God is defined as, "a being than which none greater can be conceived." 
In <i>Behalf of the Fool by Gaunilon</i>, St. Anselm discusses a 
counterargument offered by his contemporary, Gaunilon, a Benedictine 
monk who questioned St. Anselm's definition of God. <i>Monologium</i> 
considers 
the attributes of God, while <i>Cur Deus Homo</i> (translated, "Why God 
Became 
Man") addresses difficult questions about the Incarnation. This 
collection is a fine example of the intertwining of medieval philosophy 
and Christian apologetics. St. Anselm's argument for the existence of 
God influenced many philosophers in the early modern era and continues 
to influence thinkers today.<br/><br/>Emmalon Davis<br/>CCEL Staff

<p class="PFirst" id="ii-p5">THE present volume of <name id="ii-p5.1">St. Anselm&#8217;s</name> most important philosophical and theological writings contains: (1) The <i>Proslogium</i> (2) the <i>Monologium</i>, (3) the <i>Cur Deus Homo</i>, and (4) by way of historical complement, an Appendix to the <i>Monologium</i> entitled <cite id="ii-p5.2">In Behalf of the Fool</cite> by <name id="ii-p5.3">Gaunilon</name>, a monk of Marmoutiers. The <i>Proslogium</i> (which, though subsequent in point of time to the <i>Monologium</i>, is here placed first, as containing the famous ontological argument), the <i>Monologium</i> and the Appendix thereto were translated by <name id="ii-p5.4">Mr. Sidney Norton Deane</name>, of New Haven, Conn.; the <cite id="ii-p5.5">Cur Deus Homo</cite> was
rendered by <name id="ii-p5.6">James Gardiner Vose</name>, formerly of Milton, Conn., and later of Providence, R. I., and published in 1854 and 1855 in the <cite id="ii-p5.7">Bibliotheca Sacra</cite>, then issued at Andover, Mass., by <name id="ii-p5.8">Warren F. Draper</name>. The thanks of the reading public are due to all these gentlemen for their gratuitous labors in behalf of philosophy.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii-p6"><name id="ii-p6.1">Welch&#8217;s</name> recent book <cite id="ii-p6.2">Anselm and His Work</cite>, by its accessibility, renders any extended biographical notice of <name id="ii-p6.3">Anselm</name> unneccessary. We append, therefore, merely a few brief paragraphs from <name id="ii-p6.4">Weber&#8217;s</name> admirable <cite id="ii-p6.5">History of Philosophy</cite> on <name id="ii-p6.6">Anselm&#8217;s</name> position in the world of thought, and we afterwards add (this, at the suggestion of <name id="ii-p6.7">Prof. George M.

quotations regarding <name id="ii-p6.8">Anselm&#8217;s</name> most characteristic contribution to philosophy&#8212;<i>the ontological argument</i>&#8212;from <name id="ii-p6.9">Descartes</name>, <name id="ii-p6.10">Spinoza</name>, <name id="ii-p6.11">Locke</name>, <name id="ii-p6.12">Leibnitz</name>, <name id="ii-p6.13">Kant</name>, <name id="ii-p6.14">Hegel</name>, <name id="ii-p6.15">Dorner</name>, <name id="ii-p6.16">Lotze</name>, and <name id="ii-p6.17">Professor Flint</name>. A bibliography also has been compiled. Thus the work will give full material and indications for the original study of one of the greatest exponents of
Christian doctrine.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.i-p5"/>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.i-p6">&#8220;The first really speculative thinker after <name id="ii.i-p6.1">Scotus</name> is <name id="ii.i-p6.2">St. Anselmus</name>, the disciple of <name id="ii.i-p6.3">Lanfranc</name>. He was born at Aosta (1033), 
<pb n="iv" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_iv.html" id="ii.i-Page_iv"/>entered the monastery of Bec in Normandy (1060), succeeded <name id="ii.i-p6.4">Lanfranc</name> as Abbot (1078), and as Archbishop of Canterbury (1093). He died in 1109. He left a great number of writings, the most important of which are: the <i>Dialogus de grammatico</i>, the <i>Monologium de divinitatis essentia sive
Exemplum de ratione fidei</i>, the <i>Proslogium sive Fides quoerens intellectum</i>, the <i>De veritate</i>, the <i>De fide trinitatis</i>, and the <i>Cur Deus Homo?</i></p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.i-p7">&#8220;The second <name id="ii.i-p7.1">Augustine</name>, as <name id="ii.i-p7.2">St. Anselmus</name> had been called, starts out from the same principle as the first; he holds that faith precedes all reflection and all discussion concerning religious things. The unbelievers, he says, strive to understand because they do not believe; we, on the contrary, strive to understand because we believe. <i>They and we have the same object in view;</i> but inasmuch as they do not believe, they cannot arrive at
their goal, which is to understand the dogma. The unbeliever will never understand. In religion faith plays the part played by experience in the understanding of the things of this world. The blind man cannot see the light, and therefore does not understand it; the deaf-mute, who has never perceived sound, cannot have a clear idea of sound. Similarly, not to believe means not to perceive, and not to perceive means not to understand. Hence, we do not reflect in order that we may believe; on
the contrary, we believe in order that we may arrive at knowledge. A Christian ought never to doubt the beliefs and teachings of the Holy Catholic Church. All he can do is to strive, as humbly as possible, to understand her teachings by believing them, to love them, and resolutely to observe them in his daily life. Should he succeed in understanding the Christian doctrine, let him render thanks to God, the source of all intelligence! In case he fails, that is no reason why he should obstinately
attack the dogma, but a reason why he should bow his head in worship. Faith ought not merely to be the starting-point,&#8212;the Christian&#8217;s aim is not to <i>depart</i> from faith but to remain in it,&#8212;but also the fixed rule and goal of thought, the beginning, the middle, and the end of all philosophy.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.i-p8">&#8220;The above almost literal quotations might give one the impression that <name id="ii.i-p8.1">St. Anselmus</name> belongs exclusively to the history of theology. Such is not the case, however. This fervent Catholic is more independent, more of an investigator and philosopher than he himself imagines. He is a typical scholastic doctor and a fine exponent of the alliance between reason and faith which forms the characteristic trait of mediaeval philosophy. He assumes,
<span lang="la" id="ii.i-p8.2"><span lang="la" id="ii.i-p8.3"><i>a priori</i></span></span>, 
<pb n="v" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_v.html" id="ii.i-Page_v"/>that revelation and reason are in perfect accord. These two manifestations of one and the same Supreme Intelligence cannot possibly contradict each other. Hence, his point of view is diametrically opposed to the <span lang="la" id="ii.i-p8.4"><span lang="la" id="ii.i-p8.5"><i>credo quia absurdum</i></span></span>. Moreover, he too had been besieged by doubt. Indeed, the extreme ardor which impels him to search everywhere for
arguments favorable to the dogma, is a confession on his part that the dogma needs support, that it is debatable, that it lacks self-evidence, the criterion of truth. Even as a monk, it was his chief concern to find a simple and conclusive argument in support of the existence of God and of all the doctrines of the Church concerning the Supreme Being. Mere affirmation did not satisfy him; he demanded proofs. This thought was continually before his mind; it caused him to forget his meals, and
pursued him even during the solemn moments of worship. He comes to the conclusion that it is a temptation of Satan, and seeks deliverance from it. But in vain. After a night spent in meditation, he at last discovers what be has been seeking for years: the incontrovertible argument in favor of the Christian dogma, and he regards himself as fortunate in having found, not only the proof of the existence of God, but his peace of soul. His demonstrations are like the premises of modern
rationalism.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.i-p9">&#8220;Everything that exists, he says, has its cause, and this cause may be one or many. If it is one, then we have what we are looking for: God, the unitary being to whom all other beings owe their origin. If it is manifold, there are three possibilities: (1) The manifold may depend on unity as its cause; or (2) Each thing composing the manifold may be self-caused; or (3) Each thing may owe its existence to all the other things. The first case is identical with the
hypothesis that everything proceeds from a single cause; for to depend on several causes, all of which depend on a single cause, means to depend on this single cause. In the second case, we must assume that there is a power, force, or faculty of self-existence common to all the particular causes assumed by the hypothesis; a power in which all participate and are comprised. But that would give us what we had in the first case, an absolute unitary cause. The third supposition, which makes each
of the &#8216;first causes&#8217; depend on all the rest, is absurd; for we cannot hold that a thing has for its cause and condition of existence a thing of which it is itself the cause and condition. Hence we are compelled to believe in a being which is the cause of every existing thing, without being caused by anything itself, and which for 
<pb n="vi" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_vi.html" id="ii.i-Page_vi"/>that very reason is infinitely more perfect than anything else: it is the most real (<span lang="la" id="ii.i-p9.1"><span lang="la" id="ii.i-p9.2"><i>ens
realissimum</i></span></span>), most powerful, and best being. Since it does not depend on any being or on any condition of existence other than itself it is <i>a se</i> and <i>per se;</i> it exists, not because something else exists, but it exists because it exists; that is, it exists necessarily, it is necessary being.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.i-p10">&#8220;It would be an easy matter to deduce pantheism from the arguments of the <i>Monologium</i>. <name id="ii.i-p10.1">Anselmus</name>, it is true, protests against such an interpretation of his theology. With <name id="ii.i-p10.2">St. Augustine</name> he assumes that the world is created <i>ex nihilo</i>. But though accepting this teaching, he modifies it. Before the creation, he says, things did not exist <i>by themselves</i>, independently of God; hence we say they were derived from non-being. But they
existed eternally <i>for God</i> and in God, as ideas; they existed before their creation in the sense that the Creator foresaw them and predestined them for existence.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.i-p11">&#8220;The existence of God, the unitary and absolute cause of the world, being proved, the question is to determine his nature and attributes. God&#8217;s perfections are like human perfections; with this difference, however, that they are essential to him, which is not the case with us. Man has received a share of certain perfections, but there is no necessary correlation between him and these perfections; it would have been possible for him not to receive them; he could have
existed without them. God, on the contrary, does not get his perfections from without: he has not received them, and we cannot say that he <i>has</i> them; he <i>is</i> and must be everything that these perfections imply; his attributes are identical with his essence. Justice, an attribute of God, and God are not two separate things. We cannot say of God that he has justice or goodness; we cannot even say that be is just; for to be just is to participate in justice after the manner of
creatures. God is justice as such, goodness as such, wisdom as such, happiness as such, truth as such, being as such. Moreover, all of God&#8217;s attributes constitute but a single attribute, by virtue of the unity of his essence (<span lang="la" id="ii.i-p11.1"><span lang="la" id="ii.i-p11.2"><i>unum est quidquid essentialiter de summa substantia dicitur</i></span></span>).</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.i-p12">&#8220;All this is pure Platonism. But, not content with spiritualising theism, Anselmus really discredits it when, like a new Carneades, he enumerates the difficulties which he finds in the conception. God is a simple being and at the same time eternal, that is, diffused over infinite points of time; he is omnipresent, that is, 
<pb n="vii" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_vii.html" id="ii.i-Page_vii"/>distributed over all points of space. Shall we say that God is omnipresent and eternal? This proposition contradicts the notion of the
simplicity of the divine essence. Shall we say that he is nowhere in space and nowhere in time? But that would be equivalent to denying his existence. Let us therefore reconcile these two extremes and say that God is omnipresent and eternal, without being limited by space or time. The following is an equally serious difficulty: In God there is no change and consequently nothing accidental. Now, there is no substance without accidents. Hence God is not a substance; he transcends all substance.
<name id="ii.i-p12.1">Anselmus</name> is alarmed at these dangerous consequences of his logic, and he therefore prudently adds that, though the term &#8216;substance&#8217; may be incorrect, it is, nevertheless, the best we can apply to God&#8212;<span lang="la" id="ii.i-p12.2"><span lang="la" id="ii.i-p12.3"><i>si quid digne dici potest</i> </span></span>&#8212;and that to avoid or condemn it might perhaps jeopardise our faith in the reality of the Divine Being.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.i-p13">&#8220;The most formidable theological antinomy is the doctrine of the trinity of persons in the unity of the divine essence. The Word is the object of eternal thought; it is God in so far as he is thought, conceived, or comprehended by himself. The Holy Spirit is the love of God for the Word, and of the Word for God, the love which God bears himself. But is this explanation satisfactory? And does it not sacrifice the dogma which it professes to explain to the conception
of unity? <name id="ii.i-p13.1">St. Anselmus</name> sees in the Trinity and the notion of God insurmountable difficulties and contradictions, which the human mind cannot reconcile. In his discouragement be is obliged to confess, with <name id="ii.i-p13.2">Scotus Erigena</name>, <name id="ii.i-p13.3">St. Augustine</name>, and the Neo-Platonists, that no human word can adequately express the essence of the All-High. Even the words &#8216;wisdom&#8217; (<span lang="la" id="ii.i-p13.4"><span lang="la" id="ii.i-p13.5"><i>sapientia</i></span></span>) and &#8216;being&#8217; (<span lang="la" id="ii.i-p13.6"><span lang="la" id="ii.i-p13.7"><i>essentia</i></span></span>) are but imperfect expressions of what he imagines to be the essence of God. All theological phrases are analogies, figures of speech, and mere approximations.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.i-p14">&#8220;The <i>Proslogium sive Fides quoerens intellectum</i> has the same aim as the <i>Monologium:</i> to prove the existence of God. Our author draws the elements of his argument from <name id="ii.i-p14.1">St. Augustine</name> and Platonism. He sets out from the idea of a perfect being, from which he infers the existence of such a being. We have in ourselves, he says, the idea of an absolutely perfect being. Now, perfection implies existence. Hence God exists. This argument, which has
been termed the <i>ontological argument</i>, found an opponent worthy of <name id="ii.i-p14.2">Anselmus</name> in <name id="ii.i-p14.3">Gaunilo</name>, a monk of Marmoutiers in 
<pb n="viii" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_viii.html" id="ii.i-Page_viii"/>Touraine. <name id="ii.i-p14.4">Gaunilo</name> emphasises the difference between thought and being, and points out the fact that we may conceive and imagine a being, and yet that being may not exist. We have as much right to conclude from our idea of an enchanted island in the middle of the ocean that such an island actually exists. The criticism is just. Indeed,
the ontological argument would be conclusive, only in case the idea of God and the existence of God in the human mind were identical. If our idea of God is God himself, it is evident that this idea is the immediate and incontrovertible proof of the existence of God. But what the theologian aims to prove is not the existence of the God-Idea of <name id="ii.i-p14.5">Plato</name> and <name id="ii.i-p14.6">Hegel</name>, but the existence of the personal God. However that may be, we hardly know what to admire most,
&#8212;<name id="ii.i-p14.7">St. Anselmus&#8217;s</name> broad and profound conception, or the sagacity of his opponent who, in the seclusion of his cell, anticipates the Transcendental Dialectic of <name id="ii.i-p14.8">Kant</name>.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.i-p15">&#8220;The rationalistic tendency which we have just noticed in the <i>Monologium</i> and the <i>Proslogium</i> meets us again in the <i>Cur Deus Homo?</i> Why did God become man? The first word of the title sufficiently indicates the philosophical trend of the treatise. The object is to search for the <i>causes</i> of the incarnation. The incarnation, according to <name id="ii.i-p15.1">St. Anselmus</name>, necessarily foIlows from the necessity of redemption. Sin is an offence against
the majesty of God. In spite of his goodness, God cannot pardon sin without compounding with honor and justice. On the other hand, he cannot revenge himself on man for his offended honor; for sin is an offence of infinite degree and therefore demands infinite satisfaction; which means that he must either destroy humanity or inflict upon it the eternal punishments of hell. Now, in either case, the goal of creation, the happiness of his creatures, would be missed and the honor of the Creator
compromised. There is but one way for God to escape this dilemma without affecting his honor, and that is to arrange for some kind of <i>satisfaction</i>. He must have infinite satisfaction, because the offence is immeasurable. Now, in so far as man is a finite being and incapable of satisfying divine justice in an infinite measure, the infinite being himself must take the matter in charge; he must have recourse to <i>substitution.</i> Hence, the necessity of the <i>incarnation.</i> God becomes
man in Christ; Christ suffers and dies in our stead; thus he acquires an infinite merit and the right to an equivalent recompense. But since the world belongs to the Creator, and nothing can be added to its treasures, the recompense which by right belongs to Christ 
<pb n="ix" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_ix.html" id="ii.i-Page_ix"/>falls to the lot of the human race in which he is incorporated: humanity is pardoned, forgiven, and saved.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.i-p16">&#8220;Theological criticism has repudiated <name id="ii.i-p16.1">Anselmus&#8217;s</name> theory, which bears the stamp of the spirit of chivalry and of feudal customs. But, notwithstanding the attacks of a superficial rationalism, there is an abiding element of truth in it: over and above each personal and variable will there is an absolute, immutable, and incorruptible will, called justice, honor, and duty, in conformity with the customs of the times.&#8221;</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="ii.ii.i-p4">&#8220;But now, if from the simple fact that I can draw from my thought the idea of anything it follows that all that I recognise clearly and distinctly to pertain to this thing pertains to it in reality, can I not draw from this an argument and a demonstration of the existence of God? It is certain that I do not find in me the less the idea of him, that is, of a being supremely perfect, than that of any figure or of any number whatever; and I do not know less clearly and
distinctly that an actual and eternal existence belongs to his nature than I know that all that I can demonstrate of any figure or of any number belongs truly to the nature of that figure or that number: and accordingly, although all that I have concluded in the preceding meditations may not turn out to be true, the existence of God ought to pass in my mind as being at least as certain as I have up to this time regarded the truths of mathematics to be, which have to do only with numbers and
figures: although, indeed, that might not seem at first to be perfectly evident, but might appear to have some appearance of sophistry. For being accustomed in all other things to make a distinction between existence and essence, I easily persuade myself that existence may perhaps be separated from the essence of God, and thus God might be conceived as not existent actually. But nevertheless, when I think more attentively, I find that existence can no more be separated from the essence of God
than from the essence of a rectilinear triangle can be separated the equality of its three 
<pb n="x" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_x.html" id="ii.ii.i-Page_x"/>angles to two right angles, or, indeed, if you please, from the idea of a mountain the idea of a valley; so that there would be no less contradiction in conceiving of a God&#8212;that is, of a being supremely perfect, to whom existence was wanting, that is to say, to whom there was wanting any perfection&#8212;than in conceiving of a mountain which had no valley.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.ii.i-p5">&#8220;But although, in reality, I might not be able to conceive of a God without existence, no more than of a mountain without a valley, nevertheless, as from the simple fact that I conceive a mountain with a valley, it does not follow that there exists any mountain in the world, so likewise, although I conceive God as existent, it does not follow, it seems, from that, that God exists, for my thought does not impose any necessity on things; and as there is nothing to
prevent my imagining a winged horse, although there is none which has wings, so I might, perhaps, be able to attribute existence to God, although there might not be any God which existed. So far from this being so, it is just here under the appearance of this objection that a sophism lies hid; for from the fact that I cannot conceive a mountain without a valley, it does not follow that there exists in the world any mountain or any valley, but solely that the mountain and the valley, whether
they exist or not, are inseparable from one another; whereas from the fact alone that I cannot conceive God except as existent, it follows that existence is inseparable from him, and, consequently, that he exists in reality; not that my thought can make it to be so, or that it can impose any necessity upon things; but on the contrary the necessity which is in the thing itself, that is to say, the necessity of the existence of God, determines me to have this thought.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.ii.i-p6">&#8220;For it is not at my will to conceive of a God without existence, that is to say, a being supremely perfect without a supreme perfection, as it is at my will to conceive a horse with wings or without wings.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.ii.i-p7">&#8220;And it must not also be said here that it is necessarily true that I should affirm that God exists, after I have supposed him to possess all kinds of perfection, since existence is one of these, but that my first supposition is not necessary, no more than it is necessary to affirm that all figures of four sides may be inscribed in the circle, but that, supposing I had this thought, I should be constrained to admit that the rhombus can be inscribed there, since it
is a figure of four sides, and thus I should be constrained to admit something false. One ought not, I say, to allege this; for although 
<pb n="xi" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_xi.html" id="ii.ii.i-Page_xi"/>it may not be necessary that I should ever fall to thinking about God, nevertheless, when it happens that I think upon a being first and supreme, and draw, so to speak, the idea of him from the store-house of mind, it is necessary that I attribute to him every sort of perfection, although I may not go on to enumerate them all, and give attention to each
one in particular. And this necessity is sufficient to bring it about (as soon as I recognise that I should next conclude that existence is a perfection) that this first and supreme being exists: while, just as it is not necessary that I ever imagine a triangle, but whenever I choose to consider a rectilinear figure, composed solely of three angles, it is absolutely necessary that I attribute to it all the things which serve for the conclusion that there three angles are not greater than two
right angles, although, perhaps, I did not then consider this in particular.&#8221;</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.ii.ii-p5">&#8220;<i>Proof</i>.&#8212;If this be denied, conceive, if possible, that God does not exist: then his essence does not involve existence. But this (by Prop. vii.) is absurd. Therefore God necessarily exists.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.ii.ii-p6">&#8220;<i>Another Proof</i>.&#8212;Of everything whatsoever a cause or reason must be assigned, either for its existence, or for its non-existence&#8212;e. g., if a triangle exist, a reason or cause must be granted for its existence; if, on the contrary, it does not exist, a cause must also be granted, which prevents it from existing, or annuls its existence. This reason or cause must either be contained in the nature of the thing in question, or be external to it. For
instance, the reason for the non-existence of a square circle is indicated in its nature, namely, because it would involve a contradiction. On the other hand, the existence of substance follows also solely from its nature, inasmuch as its nature involves existence. (See Prop. vii.)</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.ii.ii-p7">&#8220;But the reason for the existence of a triangle or a circle does not follow from the nature of those figures, but from the order of universal nature in extension. From the latter it must follow, either that a triangle necessarily exists, or that it is impossible 
<pb n="xii" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_xii.html" id="ii.ii.ii-Page_xii"/>that it should exist. So much is self-evident. It follows therefrom that a thing necessarily exists, if no cause or reason be granted which prevents its existence.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.ii.ii-p8">&#8220;If, then, no cause or reason can be given, which prevents the existence of God, or which destroys his existence, we must certainly conclude that he necessarily does exist. If such a reason or cause should be given, it must either be drawn from the very nature of God, or be external to him&#8212;that is, drawn from another substance of another nature. For if it were of the same nature, God, by that very fact, would be admitted to exist. But substance of another
nature could have nothing in common with God (by Prop. ii.), and therefore would be unable either to cause or to destroy his existence.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.ii.ii-p9">&#8220;As, then, a reason or cause which would annul the divine existence cannot be drawn from anything external to the divine nature, such cause must perforce, if God does not exist, be drawn from God&#8217;s own nature, which would involve a contradiction. To make such an affirmation about a being absolutely infinite and supremely perfect, is absurd; therefore, neither in the nature of God, nor externally to his nature, can a cause or reason be assigned which would annul
his existence. Therefore, God necessarily exists. <i>Q. E. D.</i></p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.ii.ii-p10">&#8220;<i>Another proof</i>.&#8212;The potentiality of non-existence is a negation of power, and contrariwise the potentiality of existence is a power, as is obvious. If, then, that which necessarily exists is nothing but finite beings, such finite beings are more powerful than a being absolutely infinite, which is obviously absurd; therefore, either nothing exists, or else a being absolutely infinite necessarily exists also. Now we exist either in ourselves, or in something
else which necessarily exists (see Axiom i. and Prop. vii.). Therefore a being absolutely infinite&#8212;in other words, God (Def. vi.)&#8212;necessarily exists. <i>Q. E. D.</i></p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.ii.ii-p11">&#8220;<i>Note</i>.&#8212;In this last proof, I have purposely shown God&#8217;s existence <i>a posteriori</i>, so that the proof might be more easily followed, not because, from the same premises, God&#8217;s existence does not follow <i>a priori</i>. For, as the potentiality of existence is a power, it follows that, in proportion as reality increases in the nature of a thing, so also will it increase its strength for existence. Therefore a being absolutely infinite, such as God, has from himself an
absolutely infinite power of existence, and hence he does absolutely exist. Perhaps there will be many who will be unable 
<pb n="xiii" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_xiii.html" id="ii.ii.ii-Page_xiii"/>to see the force of this proof, inasmuch as they are accustomed only to consider those things which flow from external causes. Of such things, they see that those which quickly come to pass&#8212;that is, quickly come into existence&#8212;quickly also disappear; whereas they regard as more difficult of accomplishment&#8212;that is, not so easily brought into existence
&#8212;those things which they conceive as more complicated.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.ii.ii-p12">&#8220;However, to do away with this misconception, I need not here show the measure of truth in the proverb, &#8216;What comes quickly, goes quickly,&#8217; nor discuss whether, from the point of view of universal nature, all things are equally easy, or otherwise: I need only remark, that I am not here speaking of things, which come to pass through causes external to themselves, but only of substances which (by Prop. vi.) cannot be produced by any external cause. Things which are
produced by external causes, whether they consist of many parts or few, owe whatsoever perfection or reality they possess solely to the efficacy of their external cause, and therefore their existence arises solely from the perfection by their external cause, not from their own. Contrariwise, whatsoever perfection is possessed by substance is due to no external cause; wherefore the existence of substance must arise solely from its own nature, which is nothing else but its essence. Thus, the
perfection of a thing does not annul its existence, but, on the contrary, asserts it. Imperfection, on the other hand, does annul it; therefore we cannot be more certain of the existence of anything, than of the existence of a being absolutely infinite or perfect&#8212;that is, of God. For inasmuch as his essence excludes all imperfection, and involves absolute perfection, all cause for doubt concerning his existence is done away, and the utmost certainty on the question is given. This, I
think, will be evident to every moderately attentive reader.&#8221;</p>

<p id="ii.ii.iv-p4">&#8220;Although I am for innate ideas, and in particular for that of God, I do not think that the demonstrations of the Cartesians drawn from the idea of God are perfect. I have shown fully elsewhere (in the <cite id="ii.ii.iv-p4.1">Actes de Leipsic</cite>, and in the <cite id="ii.ii.iv-p4.2">Memoires de Trevoux</cite>) that what <name id="ii.ii.iv-p4.3">Descartes</name> has borrowed from <name id="ii.ii.iv-p4.4">Anselm</name>, Archbishop of Canterbury, is very beautiful and really very ingenious, but that there is still a gap therein to be
filled. This celebrated archbishop, who was without doubt one of the most able men of his time, congratulates himself, not without reason, for having discovered a means of proving the existence of God <i>a priori,</i> by means of its own notion, without recurring to its effects. And this is very nearly the force of his argument: God is the greatest or (as <name id="ii.ii.iv-p4.5">Descartes</name> says) the most perfect of beings, or rather a being of supreme grandeur and perfection, including all degrees thereof.
That is the notion of God. See now how existence follows from this notion. To exist is something more than not to exist, or rather, existence adds a degree to grandeur and perfection, and as <name id="ii.ii.iv-p4.6">Descartes</name> states it, existence is itself a perfection. Therefore this degree of grandeur and perfection, or rather this perfection which consists in existence, is in this supreme all-great, all-perfect being: for otherwise some degree would be wanting to it, contrary to its definition.
Consequently this supreme being exists. The Scholastics, not excepting even their <name id="ii.ii.iv-p4.7">Doctor Angelicus</name>, have misunderstood 
<pb n="xv" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_xv.html" id="ii.ii.iv-Page_xv"/>this argument, and have taken it as a paralogism; in which respect they were altogether wrong, and <name id="ii.ii.iv-p4.8">Descartes</name>, who studied quite a long time the scholastic philosophy at the Jesuit College of La Fleche, had great reason for re-establishing it. It is not a paralogism, but it is an imperfect demonstration, which assumes something that must still be
proved in order to render it mathematically evident; that is, it is tacitly assumed that this idea of the all-great or all-perfect being is possible, and implies no contradiction. And it is already something that by this remark it is proved that, <i>assuming that God is Possible, he exists,</i> which is the privilege of divinity alone. We have the right to presume the possibility of every being, and especially that of God, until some one proves the contrary. So that this metaphysical
argument already gives a morally demonstrative conclusion, which declares that according to the present state of our knowledge we must judge that God exists, and act in conformity thereto. But it is to be desired, nevertheless, that clever men achieve the demonstration with the strictness of a mathematical proof, and I think I have elsewhere said something that may serve this end.&#8221;</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="ii.ii.v-p4">&#8220;<i>Being</i> is evidently not a real predicate, or a concept of something that can be added to the concept of a thing. It is merely the admission of a thing, and of certain determinations in it. Logically, it is merely the copula of a judgment. The proposition, <i>God is almighty</i>, contains two concepts, each having its object, namely, God and almightiness. The small word <i>is</i>, is not an additional predicate, but only serves to put the predicate <i>in
relation</i> to the subject. If, then, I take the subject (God) with all its predicates (including that of almightiness), and say, <i>God is</i>, or there is a God, I do not put a new predicate to the concept of God, but I only put the subject by itself, with all its predicates, in relation to my concept, as its object. Both must contain exactly the same kind of thing, and nothing can have been added to the concept, which expresses possibility only, by my thinking its object as simply, given
and saying, it is. And thus the real does not contain more than the possible. A hundred real dollars do not contain a penny more than a hundred possible dollars. For as the latter signify 
<pb n="xvi" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_xvi.html" id="ii.ii.v-Page_xvi"/>the concept, the former the object and its position by itself, it is clear that, in case the former contained more than the latter, my concept would not express the whole object, and would not therefore be its adequate concept. In my financial position no doubt there exists more by one hundred
real dollars, than by their concept only (that is their possibility), because in reality the object is not only contained analytically in my concept, but is added to my concept (which is a determination of my state), synthetically: but the conceived hundred dollars are not in the least increased through the existence which is outside my concept.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.ii.v-p5">&#8220;By whatever and by however many predicates I may think a thing (even in completely determining it), nothing is really added to it, if I add that the thing exists. Otherwise, it would not be the same that exists, but something more than was contained in the concept, and I could not say that the exact object of my concept existed. Nay, even if I were to think in a thing all reality, except one, that one missing reality would not be supplied by my saying that so
defective a thing exists, but it would exist with the same defect with which I thought it; or what exists would be different from what I thought. If, then, I try to conceive a being, as the highest reality (without any defect), the question still remains, whether it exists or not. For though in my concept there may be wanting nothing of the possible real content of a thing in general, something is wanting in its relation to my whole state of thinking, namely, that the knowledge of that object
should be possible <span lang="la" id="ii.ii.v-p5.1"><span lang="la" id="ii.ii.v-p5.2"><i>a posteriori</i></span></span> also. And here we perceive the cause of our difficulty. If we were concerned with an object of our senses, I could not mistake the existence of a thing for the mere concept of it; for by the concept the object is thought as only in harmony with the general conditions of a possible empirical knowledge, while by its existence it is thought as contained in the whole content of experience. Through this
connection with the content of the whole experience, the concept of an object is not in the least increased; our thought has only received through it one more possible perception. If, however, we are thinking existence through the pure category alone, we need not wonder that we cannot find any characteristic to distinguish it from mere possibility.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.ii.v-p6">&#8220;Whatever, therefore, our concept of an object may contain, we must always step outside it, in order to attribute to it existence. With objects of the senses, this takes place through their connection with any one of my perceptions, according to empirical laws; 
<pb n="xvii" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_xvii.html" id="ii.ii.v-Page_xvii"/>with objects of pure thought, however, there is no means of knowing their existence, because it would have to be known entirely <span lang="la" id="ii.ii.v-p6.1"><span lang="la" id="ii.ii.v-p6.2"><i>a
priori</i></span></span>, while our consciousness of every kind of existence, whether immediately by perception, or by conclusions which connect something with perception, belongs entirely to the unity of experience, and any existence outside that field, though it cannot be declared to be absolutely impossible, is a presupposition that cannot be justified by anything.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.ii.v-p7">&#8220;The concept of a Supreme Being is, in many respects, a very useful idea, but, being an idea only, it is quite incapable of increasing, by itself alone, our knowledge with regard to what exists. It cannot even do so much as to inform us any further as to its possibility. The analytical characteristic of possibility, which consists in the absence of contradiction in mere positions (realities), cannot be denied to it; but the connection of all real properties in one
and the same thing is a synthesis the possibility of which we cannot judge <span lang="la" id="ii.ii.v-p7.1"><span lang="la" id="ii.ii.v-p7.2"><i>a priori</i></span></span> because these realities are not given to us as such, and because, even if this were so, no judgment whatever takes place, it being necessary to look for the characteristic of the possibility of synthetical knowledge in experience only, to which the object of an idea can never belong. Thus we see that the celebrated <name id="ii.ii.v-p7.3">Leibnitz</name> is far from
having achieved what we thought he had, namely, to understand <i>a priori</i> the possibility of so sublime an ideal Being.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.ii.v-p8">&#8220;Time and labor therefore are lost on the famous ontological (Cartesian) proof of the existence of a Supreme Being from mere concepts; and a man might as well imagine that he could become richer in knowledge by mere ideas, as a merchant in capital, if, in order to improve his position, he were to add a few noughts to his cash account.&#8221;</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="ii.ii.vi-p4">&#8220;This proof was included among the various proofs up to the time of <name id="ii.ii.vi-p4.1">Kant</name>, and&#8212;by some who have not yet reached the Kantian standpoint&#8212;it is so included even to the present day. It is different from what we find and read of amongst the ancients. For it was said that God is absolute thought as objective; for because things in the world are contingent, they are not the truth in and for itself&#8212;but this is found in the infinite. The
scholastics also 
<pb n="xviii" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_xviii.html" id="ii.ii.vi-Page_xviii"/>knew well from the Aristotelian philosophy the metaphysical proposition that potentiality is nothing by itself, but is clearly one with actuality. Later, on the other hand, the opposition between thought itself and Being began to appear with Anselm. It is noteworthy that only now for the first time through the Middle Ages and in Christianity, the universal Notion and Being, as it is to ordinary conception, became established in this pure abstraction as these infinite
extremes; and thus the highest law has come to consciousness. But we reach our profoundest depths in bringing the highest opposition into consciousness. Only no advance was made beyond the division as such, although Anselm also tried to find the connection between the sides. But while hitherto God appeared as the absolute existent, and the universal was attributed to Him as predicate, an opposite order begins with Anselm&#8212;Being becomes predicate, and the absolute Idea is first of all
established as the subject, but the subject of thought. Thus if the existence of God is once abandoned as the first hypothesis, and established as a result of thought, self-consciousness is on the way to turn back within itself. Then we have the question coming in, Does God exist? while on the other side the question of most importance was, What is God?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.ii.vi-p5">&#8220;The ontological proof, which is the first properly metaphysical proof of the existence of God, consequently came to mean that God as the Idea of existence which unites all reality in itself, also has the reality of existence within Himself; this proof thus follows from the Notion of God, that He is the universal essence of all essence. The drift of this reasoning is, according to Anselm (<i>Proslogium,</i> C. 2), as follows: &#8216;It is one thing to say that a thing
is in the understanding, and quite another to perceive that it exists. Even an ignorant person (<span lang="la" id="ii.ii.vi-p5.1"><span lang="la" id="ii.ii.vi-p5.2"><i>insipiens</i></span></span>) will thus be quite convinced that in thought there is something beyond which nothing greater can be thought ; for when he hears this he understands it, and everything that is understood is in the understanding. But that beyond which nothing greater can be thought cannot certainly be in the understanding alone. For if it is
accepted as in thought alone, we may go on farther to accept it as existent; that, however, is something greater&#8217; than what is merely thought. &#8216;Thus were that beyond which nothing greater can be thought merely in the understanding, that beyond which nothing greater can be thought would be something beyond which something greater can be thought. But that is truly impossible; there thus 
<pb n="xix" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_xix.html" id="ii.ii.vi-Page_xix"/>without doubt exists both in the understanding and in reality something beyond which nothing greater can
be thought.&#8217; The highest conception cannot be in the understanding alone; it is essential that it should exist. Thus it is made clear that Being is in a superficial way subsumed under the universal of reality, that to this extent Being does not enter into opposition with the Notion. That is quite right; only the transition is not demonstrated&#8212;that the subjective understanding abrogates itself. This, however, is just the question which gives the whole interest to the matter. When reality
or completion is expressed in such a way that it is not yet posited as existent, it is something thought, and rather opposed to Being than that this is subsumed under it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.ii.vi-p6">&#8220;This mode of arguing held good until the time of <name id="ii.ii.vi-p6.1">Kant</name>; and we see in it the endeavor to apprehend the doctrine of the Church through reason. This opposition between Being and thought is the starting-point in philosophy, the absolute that contains the two opposites within itself&#8212;a conception, according to <name id="ii.ii.vi-p6.2">Spinoza</name>, which involves its existence likewise. Of Anselm it is however to be remarked that the formal logical mode of the
understanding, the process of scholastic reasoning is to be found in him; the content indeed is right, but the form faulty. For in the first place the expression &#8216;the thought of a Highest&#8217; is assumed as <span lang="la" id="ii.ii.vi-p6.3"><span lang="la" id="ii.ii.vi-p6.4"><i>prius</i></span></span>. Secondly, there are two sorts of objects of thought&#8212;one that is and another that is not; the object that is only thought and does not exist, is as imperfect as that which only is without being thought. The third point
is that what is highest must likewise exist. But what is highest, the standard to which all else must conform, must be no mere hypothesis, as we find it represented in the conception of a highest acme of perfection, as a content which is thought and likewise <i>is.</i> This very content, the unity of Being and thought, is thus indeed the true content, but because Anselm has it before him only in the form of the understanding, the opposites are identical and conformable to unity in a third
determination only&#8212;the Highest&#8212;which, in as far as it is regulative, is outside of them. In this it is involved that we should first of all have subjective thought, and then distinguished from that, Being. We allow that if we think a content (and it is apparently indifferent whether this is God or any other), it may be the case that this content does not exist. The assertion &#8216;Something that is thought does not exist&#8217; is now subsumed under the above standard and is not conformable to
it. We grant that the truth is that which is not merely thought 
<pb n="xx" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_xx.html" id="ii.ii.vi-Page_xx"/>but which likewise is. But of this opposition nothing here is said. Undoubtedly God would be imperfect, if He were merely thought and did not also have the determination of Being. But in relation to God we must not take thought as merely subjective; thought here signifies the absolute, pure thought, and thus we must ascribe to Him the quality of Being. On the other hand if God were merely Being, if He were not conscious of
Himself as self-consciousness, He would not be Spirit, a thought that thinks itself.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="ii.ii.vi-p7">&#8220;Kant, on the other hand, attacked and rejected Anselm&#8217;s proof&#8212;which rejection the whole world afterwards followed up&#8212;on the ground of its being an assumption that the unity of Being and thought is the highest perfection. What Kant thus demonstrates in the present day&#8212;that Being is different from thought and that Being is not by any means posited with thought&#8212;was a criticism offered even in that time by a monk named Gaunilo. He combated
this proof of Anselm&#8217;s in a <cite id="ii.ii.vi-p7.1">Liber pro insipiente</cite> to which Anselm himself directed a reply in his <cite id="ii.ii.vi-p7.2">Liber apologeticus adversus insipientem</cite>. Thus Kant says (<cite id="ii.ii.vi-p7.3">Kritik der reinen Vernunft</cite>, P. 464 of the sixth edition): If we think a hundred dollars, this conception does not involve existence. That is certainly true: what is only a conception does not exist, but it is likewise not a true content, for what does not exist, is merely an untrue conception. Of
such we do not however here speak, but of pure thought; it is nothing new to say they are different&#8212;Anselm knew this just as well as we do. God is the infinite, just as body and soul, Being and thought are eternally united; this is the speculative, true definition of God. To the proof which <name id="ii.ii.vi-p7.4">Kant</name> criticises in a manner which it is the fashion to follow now-a-days, there is thus lacking only the perception of the unity of thought and of existence in the infinite; and this
alone must form the commencement.&#8221;</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="ii.ii.vii-p3">&#8220;According to the <i>Monologium</i>, we arrive at the mental representation of God by the agency of faith and conscience, therefore by a combined religious and moral method; by the same means we arrive at the representation of the relativity of the world. But as there seemed to Anselm something inadequate in making the Being of the Absolute dependent upon the existence 
<pb n="xxi" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_xxi.html" id="ii.ii.vii-Page_xxi"/>of the Relative, as if the latter were more certain than the former, he has interpolated in
the <i>Proslogium</i> (<i>Alloquium Dei</i>) the Ontological method. The thought of God, which is always given, and the being of which is to be proved, claims, at any rate, to be the highest thought possible; indeed, upon close comparison with all other thoughts which come and go, with thoughts of such things as may just as well not exist as exist, it has the essential peculiarity, the prerogative, so to speak,&#8212;and this is Anselm&#8217;s discovery,&#8212;that, if it is actually thought of as
the highest conceivable thought, it is also thought of as existent. Were it not thought of as being, it would not for a moment be actually thought. Anselm then proceeds with his proof as follows: &#8216;We believe Thou art something, beyond which nothing greater can be thought. The fool (<scripRef passage="Ps. xiv." id="ii.ii.vii-p3.1" parsed="|Ps|14|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.14">Ps. xiv.</scripRef>) denies the existence of such a Being. Is He therefore non-existent? But the very fool hears and understands what I say, &#8220;something, greater than which there is nothing,&#8221; and what he understands is in his
understanding. That it also exists without him would thus have to be proved. But that, beyond which nothing greater can be thought, cannot exist in mere intellect. For did it exist only in intellect, the thought might be framed that it was realised, and that would be a greater thought. Consequently, were that, a greater than which cannot be thought, existent in mere intellect, the thought <span lang="la" id="ii.ii.vii-p3.2"><span lang="la" id="ii.ii.vii-p3.3"><i>quo majus cogitari non potest</i></span></span> would at the
same time be <span lang="la" id="ii.ii.vii-p3.4"><span lang="la" id="ii.ii.vii-p3.5"><i>quo majus cogitari potest</i></span></span>, which is impossible. Consequently, there exists, in reality as well as in the understanding, something a greater than which cannot be thought. And this is so true that its non-existence cannot be thought. Something may be thought which is only to be thought as existent, and that is a <span lang="la" id="ii.ii.vii-p3.6"><span lang="la" id="ii.ii.vii-p3.7"><i>majus</i></span></span> than that the non-existence of
which may be thought, and that Thou art, O Lord, my God, I must think though I did not believe.&#8217; The nerve of the Anselmic argument lies therefore in the notion that an idea which has an objective existence is a <span lang="la" id="ii.ii.vii-p3.8"><span lang="la" id="ii.ii.vii-p3.9"><i>majus</i></span></span> than that to which mere subjective existence appertains; that, consequently, as under the idea of God the highest thought possible is at any rate expressed, the idea of God is not thought unless it is thought as
existent. For, he says in another place, it may be thought of everything that it does not exist, with the exception of that <span lang="la" id="ii.ii.vii-p3.10"><span lang="la" id="ii.ii.vii-p3.11"><i>quod summe est</i></span></span> to which being pre-eminently belongs. That is, the non-existence may be thought of everything which has beginning or end, or which is constituted of parts and is nowhere whole. But that, and it alone, cannot be thought as non-existent which has neither beginning nor end, and is not
constituted of parts, but is thought of as 
<pb n="xxii" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_xxii.html" id="ii.ii.vii-Page_xxii"/>everywhere existing whole. <name id="ii.ii.vii-p3.12">Gaunilo</name>, Count of Montigny, makes a twofold answer in defence of the atheist. He says that that highest essence has no being in the understanding; it only exists therein by the ear, not by being; it only exists as a man who has heard a sound endeavors to embrace a thing wholly unknown to him in an image. And therein, he says, it is concluded that the mental representation of God in mankind is already a
purely contingent one, and is produced from without by the sound of words; its necessary presence in the spirit is not proved. Thus, he adds, much is wanting to the ability of inferring its existence from the finding of such an image in the spirit. In the sphere of mere imagination no one thing has a less or a greater existence than any other thing; each has equally no existence at all. Therefore, he writes, granted that the presence of the idea of God in the spirit is not contingent, still the
thought or the concept of God does not essentially argue the being of God. Similarly says <name id="ii.ii.vii-p3.13">Kant</name> later on: &#8216;We are no richer if we think of our ability as one cipher more.&#8217; That Anselm also undoubtedly knew, but he opined that the concept of God is different to any other thought, which remains unaltered, whether it is thought of as existent or non-existent; the concept of God is that thought, which is no longer thought unless it is thought as existent, and which, therefore,
essentially involves being. But, of course, it is insufficiently established by Anselm that a concept of God which does not necessarily include existence, is not the highest thought, and therefore is not the concept of God, and that, consequently, the really highest thought must also be thought of as existent. To this the following objection attaches. Inasmuch as Anselm treated existence as a <span lang="la" id="ii.ii.vii-p3.14"><span lang="la" id="ii.ii.vii-p3.15"><i>majus</i></span></span> compared with non-existence,
he treated existence as an attribute, whereas it is the bearer of all attributes. So it is not proved by Anselm that the origin of this idea, which, when thought, is thought as existent, is not contingent to the reason, but necessary; and that reason only remains reason by virtue of this idea. Finally, Anselm thinks, thus overrating the Ontological moment, that he has already attained therein the full concept of God. These shortcomings were to be obviated, stage by stage, by his
successors.&#8221;</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="ii.ii.viii-p3">&#8220;To conclude that because the notion of a most perfect Being includes reality as one of its perfections, therefore a most perfect Being necessarily <i>exists</i>, is so obviously to conclude falsely, that after <name id="ii.ii.viii-p3.1">Kant&#8217;s</name> incisive refutation any attempt to defend such reasoning would be useless. Anselm, in his more free and spontaneous reflection, has here and there touched the thought that the greatest which we can think, if we think it as <i>only</i>
thought, is less than the same greatest if we think it as existent. It is not possible that from this reflection either any one should develop a logically cogent proof, but the way in which it is put seems to reveal another fundamental thought which is seeking for expression. For what would it matter if that which is thought as most perfect were, as thought, less than the least reality? Why should this thought disturb us? Plainly for this reason, that it is an immediate certainty that what is
greatest, most beautiful, most worthy is not a mere thought, but must be a reality, because it would be intolerable to believe of our ideal that it is an idea produced by the action of thought but having no existence, no power, and no validity in the world of reality. We do not from the perfection of that which is perfect immediately deduce its reality as a logical consequence; but without the circumlocution of a deduction we directly feel the impossibility of its non-existence, and all
semblance of syllogistic proof only serves to make more clear the directness of this certainty. If what is greatest did not <i>exist,</i> then what is <i>greatest</i> would not be, and it is not impossible that that which is greatest of all conceivable things should <i>not</i> be.&#8221;</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="ii.ii.ix-p3">&#8220;Anselm was the founder of that kind of argumentation which, in the opinion of many, is alone entitled to be described as <span lang="la" id="ii.ii.ix-p3.1"><span lang="la" id="ii.ii.ix-p3.2"><i>a priori</i></span></span> or ontological. He reasoned thus: &#8216;The fool may say in his heart, There is no God; but he only proves thereby that he is a fool, for what he says is self-contradictory. Since he denies that there is a God, he has in his mind the idea of God, and that idea implies the

<pb n="xxiv" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_xxiv.html" id="ii.ii.ix-Page_xxiv"/>existence of God, for it is the idea of a Being than which a higher cannot be conceived. That than which a higher cannot be conceived cannot exist merely as an idea, because what exists merely as an idea is inferior to what exists in reality as well as in idea. The idea of a highest Being which exists merely in thought, is the idea of a highest Being which is not the highest even in thought, but inferior to a highest Being which exists in fact as well as in thought.&#8217; This reasoning found
unfavorable critics even among the contemporaries of Anselm, and has commended itself completely to few. Yet it may fairly be doubted whether it has been conclusively refuted, and some of the objections most frequently urged against it are certainly inadmissible. It is no answer to it, for example, to deny that the idea of God is innate or universal. The argument merely assumes that he who denies that there is a God must have an idea of God. There is also no force, as Anselm showed, in the
objection of <name id="ii.ii.ix-p3.3">Gaunilo</name>, that the existence of God can no more be inferred from the idea of a perfect being, than the existence of a perfect island is to be inferred from the idea of such an island. There neither is nor can be an idea of an island which is greater and better than any other that can ever be conceived. Anselm could safely promise that he would make <name id="ii.ii.ix-p3.4">Gaunilo</name> a present of such an island when he had really imagined it. Only one being&#8212;an infinite,
independent, necessary being&#8212;can be perfect in the sense of being greater and better than every other conceivable being. The objection that the ideal can never logically yield the real&#8212;that the transition from thought to fact must be in every instance illegitimate&#8212;is merely an assertion that the argument is fallacious. It is an assertion which cannot fairly be made until the argument has been exposed and refuted. The argument is that a certain thought of God is found
necessarily to imply His existence. The objection that existence is not a predicate, and that the idea of a God who exists is not more complete and perfect than the idea of a God who does not exist, is, perhaps, not incapable of being satisfactorily repelled. Mere existence is not a predicate, but specifications or determinations of existence are predicable. Now the argument nowhere implies that existence is a predicate; it implies only that reality, necessity, and independence of existence are
predicates of existence; and it implies this on the ground that existence <span lang="la" id="ii.ii.ix-p3.5"><span lang="la" id="ii.ii.ix-p3.6"><i>in re</i></span></span> can be distinguished from existence <span lang="la" id="ii.ii.ix-p3.7"><span lang="la" id="ii.ii.ix-p3.8"><i>in conceptu</i></span></span><i>, </i>necessary from contingent existence, self-existence from derived existence. Specific distinctions must surely admit of being 
<pb n="xxv" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_xxv.html" id="ii.ii.ix-Page_xxv"/>predicated. That the exclusion of existence&#8212;which here means real and necessary existence
&#8212;from the idea of God does not leave us with an incomplete idea of God, is not a position, I think, which can be maintained. Take away existence from among the elements in the idea of a perfect being, and the idea becomes either the idea of a nonentity or the idea of an idea, and not the idea of a perfect being at all. Thus, the argument of Anselm is unwarrantably represented as an argument of four terms instead of three. Those who urge the objection seem to me to prove only that if our
thought of God be imperfect, a being who merely realised that thought would be an imperfect being; but there is a vast distance between this truism and the paradox that an unreal being may be an ideally perfect being.&#8221;</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iii.i-p1">In this brief work the author aims at proving in a single argument the existence of God, and whatsoever we believe of God.&#8212;The difficulty of the task.&#8212;The author writes in the person of one who contemplates God, and seeks to understand what he believes. To this work he had given this title: Faith Seeking Understanding. He finally named it Proslogium,&#8212;that is, A Discourse.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iii.i-p2">AFTER I had published, at the solicitous entreaties of certain brethren, a brief work (the <i>Monologium</i>) as an example of meditation on the grounds of faith, in the person of one who investigates, in a course of silent reasoning with himself, matters of which he is ignorant; considering that this book was knit together by the linking of many arguments, I began to ask myself whether there might be found a single argument which would require no other for its proof
than itself alone; and alone would suffice to demonstrate that God truly exists, and that there is a supreme good requiring nothing else, which all other things require for their existence and well-being; and whatever we believe regarding the divine Being.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iii.i-p3">Although I often and earnestly directed my thought to this end, and at some times that which I sought 


<pb n="2" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_2.html" id="iii.i-Page_2"/>
seemed to be just within my reach, while again it wholly evaded my mental vision, at last in despair I was about to cease, as if from the search for a thing which could not be found. But when I wished to exclude this thought altogether, lest, by busying my mind to no purpose, it should keep me from other thoughts, in which I might be successful; then more and more,
though I was unwilling and shunned it, it began to force itself upon me, with a kind of importunity. So, one day, when I was exceedingly wearied with resisting its importunity, in the very conflict of my thoughts, the proof of which I had despaired offered itself, so that I eagerly embraced the thoughts which I was strenuously repelling.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iii.i-p4">Thinking, therefore, that what I rejoiced to have found, would, if put in writing, be welcome to some readers, of this very matter, and of some others, I have written the following treatise, in the person of one who strives to lift his mind to the contemplation of God, and seeks to understand what he believes. In my judgment, neither this work nor the other, which I mentioned above, deserved to be called a book, or to bear the name of an author; and yet I thought
they ought not to be sent forth without some title by which they might, in some sort, invite one into whose hands they fell to their perusal. I accordingly gave each a title, that the first might be known as, An Example of Meditation on the Grounds of Faith, and its sequel as, Faith Seeking Understanding. But, after, both had been copied by many under these titles, many urged me, and especially <name id="iii.i-p4.1">Hugo</name>, the reverend Archbishop of Lyons, who discharges the apostolic office in Gaul, who
instructed me to this effect on his apostolic authority&#8212;to prefix my name to these writings. 
<pb n="3" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_3.html" id="iii.i-Page_3"/>And that this might be done more fitly, I named the first, <i>Monologium</i>, that is, A Soliloquy; but the second, <i>Proslogium</i>, that is, A Discourse.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iii.ii-p1">Exhortation of the mind to the contemplation of God.&#8212;It casts aside cares, and excludes all thoughts save that of God, that it may seek Him. Man was created to see God. Man by sin lost the blessedness for which he was made, and found the misery for which he was not made. He did not keep this good when he could keep it easily. Without God it is ill with us. Our labors and attempts are in vain without God. Man cannot seek God, unless God himself teaches him;
nor find him, unless he reveals himself. God created man in his image, that he might be mindful of him, think of him, and love him. The believer does not seek to understand, that he may believe, but he believes that he may understand: for unless he believed he would not understand.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iii.ii-p2">UP now, slight man! flee, for a little while, thy occupations; hide thyself, for a time, from thy disturbing thoughts. Cast aside, now, thy burdensome cares, and put away thy toilsome business. Yield room for some little time to God; and rest for a little time in him. Enter the inner chamber of thy mind; shut out all thoughts save that of God, and such as can aid thee in seeking him; close thy door and seek him. Speak now, my whole heart! speak now to God, saying, I
seek thy face; thy face, Lord, will I seek (<scripRef passage="Psalms 27:8" id="iii.ii-p2.1" parsed="|Ps|27|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.27.8">Psalms xxvii. 8</scripRef>). And come thou now, O Lord my God, teach my heart where and how it may seek thee, where and how it may find thee.</p>

He longs to come to thee, and thy dwelling-place is inaccessible. He is eager to find thee, and knows not thy place. He desires to seek thee, and does not know thy face.

is that than which a greater cannot be conceived. And he who thoroughly understands this, assuredly understands that this being so truly exists, that not even in concept can it be non-existent. Therefore, he who understands that God so exists, cannot conceive that he does not exist.</p>

God is supremely compassionate, because he is supremely just. He saveth the just, because justice goes with them; he frees sinners by the authority of justice. God spares the wicked out of justice; for it
is just that God, than whom none is better or more powerful, should be good even to the wicked, and should make the wicked good. If God ought not to pity, he pities unjustly. But this it is impious to suppose. Therefore, God justly pities.</p>

And, although it appears why thou dost reward the good with goods and the evil with evils; yet this, at least, is most wonderful, why thou, the all and supremely just, who lackest nothing, bestowest goods on the wicked and on those who are guilty toward thee.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iii.x-p6">For, although thou dost reward the good with goods and the evil with evils, out of goodness, yet this the concept of justice seems to demand. But, when thou dost bestow goods on the evil, and it is known that the supremely Good hath willed to do this, we wonder why the supremely just has been able to will this.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iii.x-p7">O compassion, from what abundant sweetness and what sweet abundance dost thou well forth to us! O boundless goodness of God how passionately should sinners love thee! For thou savest the just, because justice goeth with them; but sinners thou dost free by the authority of justice. Those by the help of their deserts; these, although their deserts oppose. Those by acknowledging the goods thou hast granted; these by pardoning the evils thou hatest. O boundless

<p class="PContinue" id="iii.x-p8">For, though it is hard to understand how thy compassion is not inconsistent with thy justice; yet we must believe that it does not oppose justice at all, because it flows from goodness, which is no goodness without justice; nay, that it is in true harmony with justice. For, if thou art compassionate only because thou art supremely good, and supremely good only because thou art supremely just, truly thou art compassionate even because thou art supremely just. Help
me, just and compassionate God, whose light seek; help me to understand what I say.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iii.x-p9">Truly, then, thou art compassionate even because thou art just. Is, then, thy compassion born of thy justice?

Is it because it is just, that thou shouldst be so good that thou canst not be conceived better; and that thou shouldst work so powerfully that thou canst not be conceived more powerful?

could not be that thou shouldst be good only by requiting (<span lang="la" id="iii.x-p9.1"><span lang="la" id="iii.x-p9.2"><i>retribuendo</i></span></span>) and not by sparing, and that thou shouldst make good only those who are not good, and not the wicked also.

<p class="PContinue" id="iii.xxvi-p9">Yet assuredly, if any other whom thou didst love altogether as thyself possessed the same blessedness, thy joy would be doubled, because thou wouldst rejoice not less for him than for thyself. But, if two, or three, or many more, had the same joy, thou wouldst rejoice as much for each one as for thyself, if thou didst love each as thyself. Hence, in that perfect love of innumerable blessed angels and sainted men, where none shall love another less than himself,
every one shall rejoice for each of the others as for himself.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iii.xxvi-p10">If, then, the heart of man will scarce contain his joy over his own so great good, how shall it contain so many and so great joys? And doubtless, seeing that every one loves another so far as he rejoices in the other&#8217;s good, and as, in that perfect felicity, each one should love God beyond compare, more than himself and all the others with him; so he will rejoice beyond reckoning in the felicity of God, more than in his own and that of all the others with him.</p>

<h2 id="iv-p1.1">ON THE BEING OF GOD.</h2>

<div2 title="Preface" n="i" shorttitle="" progress="22.04%" prev="iv" next="iv.ii" id="iv.i">
<h3 id="iv.i-p0.1">PREFACE.</h3> 

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.i-p1">In this book Anselm discusses, under the form of a meditation, the Being of God, basing his argument not on the authority of Scripture, but on the force of reason. It contains nothing that is inconsistent with the writings of the Holy Fathers, and especially nothing that is inconsistent with those of <name id="iv.i-p1.1">St. Augustine</name>. &#8212;The Greek terminology is employed in Chapter LXXVIII., where it is stated that the Trinity may be said to consist of three
substances, that is, three persons.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.i-p2">CERTAIN brethren have often and earnestly entreated me to put in writing some thoughts that I had offered them in familiar conversation, regarding meditation on the Being of God, and on some other topics connected with this subject, under the form of a meditation on these themes. It is in accordance with their wish, rather than with my ability, that they have prescribed such a form for the writing of this meditation; in order that nothing in Scripture should be urged
on the authority of Scripture itself, but that whatever the conclusion of independent investigation should declare to be true, should, in an unadorned style, with common proofs and with a simple argument, be briefly enforced by the cogency of reason, and plainly expounded in the light of truth. It was 
<pb n="36" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_36.html" id="iv.i-Page_36"/>their wish also, that I should not disdain to meet such simple and almost foolish objections as occur to me.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.i-p3">This task I have long refused to undertake. And, reflecting on the matter, I have tried on many grounds to excuse myself; for the more they wanted this work to be adaptable to practical use, the more was what they enjoined on me difficult of execution. Overcome at last, however, both by the modest importunity of their entreaties and by the not contemptible sincerity of their zeal; and reluctant as I was because of the difficulty of my task and the weakness of my
talent, I entered upon the work they asked for. But it is with pleasure inspired by their affection that, so far as I was able, I have prosecuted this work within the limits they set.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.i-p4">I was led to this undertaking in the hope that whatever I might accomplish would soon be overwhelmed with contempt, as by men disgusted with some worthless thing. For I know that in this book I have not so much satisfied those who entreated me, as put an end to the entreaties that followed me so urgently. Yet, somehow it fell out, contrary to my hope, that not only the brethren mentioned above, but several others, by making copies for their own use, condemned this
writing to long remembrance. And, after frequent consideration, I have not been able to find that I have made in it any statement which is inconsistent with the writings of the Catholic Fathers, or especially with those of <name id="iv.i-p4.1">St. Augustine</name>. Wherefore, if it shall appear to any man that I have offered in this work any thought that is either too novel or discordant with the truth, I ask him not to denounce me at once as one who boldly seizes upon new ideas, or as a maintainer of
falsehood; but let 
<pb n="37" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_37.html" id="iv.i-Page_37"/>him first read diligently Augustine&#8217;s books on the Trinity, and then judge my treatise in the light of those.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.i-p5">In stating that the supreme Trinity may be said to consist of three substances, I have followed the Greeks, who acknowledge three substances in one Essence, in the same faith wherein we acknowledge three persons in one Substance. For they designate by the word <i>substance</i> that attribute of God which we designate by the word <i>person.</i></p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.i-p6">Whatever I have said on that point, however, is put in the mouth of one debating and investigating in solitary reflection, questions to which he had given no attention before. And this method I knew to be in accordance with the wish of those whose request I was striving to fulfil. But it is my prayer and earnest entreaty, that if any shall wish to copy this work, he shall be careful to place this preface at the beginning of the book, before the body of the
meditation itself. For I believe that one will be much helped in understanding the matter of this book, if he has taken note of the intention, and the method according to which it is discussed. It is my opinion, too, that one who has first seen this preface will not pronounce a rash judgment, if he shall find offered here any thought that is contrary to his own belief.</p>

<div2 type="Chapter" title="Chapter I." shorttitle="Chapter I" progress="22.88%" prev="iv.i" next="iv.iii" id="iv.ii">
<h3 id="iv.ii-p0.1">CHAPTER I.</h3> 

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.ii-p1">There is a being which is best, and greatest, and highest of all existing beings.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.ii-p2">IF any man, either from ignorance or unbelief, has no knowledge of the existence of one Nature which is the highest of all existing beings, which is also sufficient 
<pb n="38" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_38.html" id="iv.ii-Page_38"/>to itself in its eternal blessedness, and which confers upon and effects in all other beings, through its omnipotent goodness, the very fact of their existence, and the fact that in any way their existence is good; and if he has no knowledge of many other things, which we necessarily believe regarding God
and his creatures, he still believes that he can at least convince himself of these truths in great part, even if his mental powers are very ordinary, by the force of reason alone.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.ii-p3">And, although he could do this in many ways, I shall adopt one which I consider easiest for such a man. For, since all desire to enjoy only those things which they suppose to be good, it is natural that this man should, at some time, turn his mind&#8217;s eye to the examination of that cause by which these things are good, which he does not desire, except as he judges them to be good. So that, as reason leads the way and follows up these considerations, he advances
rationally to those truths of which, without reason, he has no knowledge. And if, in this discussion, I use any argument which no greater authority adduces, I wish it to be received in this way: although, on the grounds that I shall see fit to adopt, the conclusion is reached as if necessarily, yet it is not, for this reason, said to be absolutely necessary, but merely that it can appear so for the time being.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.ii-p4">It is easy, then, for one to say to himself: Since there are goods so innumerable, whose great diversity we experience by the bodily senses, and discern by our mental faculties, must we not believe that there is some one thing, through which all goods whatever are good? Or are they good one through one thing and another through another? To be sure, it is most 
<pb n="39" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_39.html" id="iv.ii-Page_39"/>certain and clear, for all who are willing to see, that whatsoever things are said to possess any
attribute in such a way that in mutual comparison they may be said to possess it in greater, or less, or equal degree, are said to possess it by virtue of some fact, which is not understood to be one thing in one case and another in another, but to be the same in different cases, whether it is regarded as existing in these cases in equal or unequal degree. For, whatsoever things are said to be <i>just,</i> when compared one with another, whether equally, or more, or less, cannot be understood
as just, except through the quality of<i> justness,</i> which is not one thing in one instance, and another in another.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.ii-p5">Since it is certain, then, that all goods, if mutually compared, would prove either equally or unequally good, necessarily they are all good by virtue of something which is conceived of as the same in different goods, although sometimes they seem to be called good, the one by virtue of one thing, the other by virtue of another. For, apparently it is by virtue of one quality, that a horse is called <i>good,</i> because he is strong, and by virtue of another, that he
is called <i>good,</i> because he is swift. For, though he seems to be called good by virtue of his strength, and good by virtue of his swiftness, yet swiftness and strength do not appear to be the same thing.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.ii-p6">But if a horse, because he is strong and swift, is therefore good, how is it that a strong, swift robber is bad? Rather, then, just as a strong, swift robber is bad, because he is harmful, so a strong, swift horse is good, because he is useful. And, indeed, nothing is ordinarily regarded as good, except either for some utility&#8212;as, for instance, safety is called good, and 
<pb n="40" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_40.html" id="iv.ii-Page_40"/>those things which promote safety&#8212;or for some honorable character&#8212;as,
for instance, beauty is reckoned to be good, and what promotes beauty.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.ii-p7">But, since the reasoning which we have observed is in no wise refutable, necessarily, again, all things, whether useful or honorable, if they are truly good, are good through that same being through which all goods exist, whatever that being is. But who can doubt this very being, through which all goods exist, to be a great good? This must be, then, a good through itself, since every other good is through it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.ii-p8">It follows, therefore, that all other goods are good through another being than that which they themselves are, and this being alone is good through itself. Hence, this alone is supremely good, which is alone good through itself. For it is supreme, in that it so surpasses other beings, that it is neither equalled nor excelled. But that which is supremely good is also supremely great. There is, therefore, some one being which is supremely good, and supremely great,
that is, the highest of all existing beings.</p>

<h3 id="iv.iii-p0.1">CHAPTER II.</h3> 

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.iii-p1">The same subject continued.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.iii-p2">BUT, just as it has been proved that there is a being that is supremely good, since all goods are good through a single being, which is good through itself; so it is necessarily inferred that there is something supremely great, which is great through itself. But, I do not mean physically great, as a material object is great, but that which, the greater it is, is the better or the more worthy,&#8212;wisdom, for instance. And 
<pb n="41" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_41.html" id="iv.iii-Page_41"/>since there can be nothing supremely
great except what is supremely good, there must be a being that is greatest and best, i. e., the highest of all existing beings.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="Chapter" title="Chapter III." shorttitle="Chapter III" progress="23.95%" prev="iv.iii" next="iv.v" id="iv.iv">
<h3 id="iv.iv-p0.1">CHAPTER III.</h3> 

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.iv-p1">There is a certain Nature through which whatever is exists, and which exists through itself, and is the highest of all existing beings.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.iv-p2">THEREFORE, not only are all good things such through something that is one and the same, and all great things such through something that is one and the same; but whatever is, apparently exists through something that is one and the same. For, everything that is, exists either through something, or through nothing. But nothing exists through nothing. For it is altogether inconceivable that anything should not exist by virtue of something.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.iv-p3">Whatever is, then, does not exist except through something. Since this is true, either there is one being, or there are more than one, through which all things that are exist. But if there are more than one, either these are themselves to be referred to some one being, through which they exist, or they exist separately, each through itself, or they exist mutually through one another.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.iv-p4">But, if these beings exist through one being, then all things do not exist through more than one, but rather through that one being through which these exist.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.iv-p5">If, however, these exist separately, each through itself, there is, at any rate, some power or property of existing through self (<span lang="la" id="iv.iv-p5.1"><span lang="la" id="iv.iv-p5.2"><i>existendi per se</i></span></span>), by which 
<pb n="42" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_42.html" id="iv.iv-Page_42"/>they are able to exist each through itself. But, there can be no doubt that, in that case, they exist through this very power, which is one, and through which they are able to exist, each through itself. More truly, then, do all things exist
through this very being, which is one, than through these, which are more than one, which, without this one, cannot exist.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.iv-p6">But that these beings exist mutually through one another, no reason can admit; since it is an irrational conception that anything should exist through a being on which it confers existence. For not even beings of a relative nature exist thus mutually, the one through the other. For, though the terms <i>master</i> and <i>servant</i> are used with mutual reference, and the men thus designated are mentioned as having mutual relations, yet they do not at all exist
mutually, the one through the other, since these relations exist through the subjects to which they are referred.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.iv-p7">Therefore, since truth altogether excludes the supposition that there are more beings than one, through which all things exist, that being, through which all exist, must be one. Since, then, all things that are exist through this one being, doubtless this one being exists through itself. Whatever things there are else then, exist through something other than themselves, and this alone through itself. But whatever exists through another is less than that, through
which all things are, and which alone exists through itself. Therefore, that which exists through itself exists in the greatest degree of all things.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.iv-p8">There is, then, some one being which alone exists in the greatest and the highest degree of all. But that which is greatest of all, and through which exists whatever is good or great, and, in short, whatever 
<pb n="43" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_43.html" id="iv.iv-Page_43"/>has any existence&#8212;that must be supremely good, and supremely great, and the highest of all existing beings.</p>

<div2 type="Chapter" title="Chapter IV." shorttitle="Chapter IV" progress="24.57%" prev="iv.iv" next="iv.vi" id="iv.v">
<h3 id="iv.v-p0.1">CHAPTER IV.</h3> 

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.v-p1">The same subject continued.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.v-p2">FURTHERMORE, if one observes the nature of things he perceives, whether he will or no, that not all are embraced in a single degree of dignity; but that certain among them are distinguished by inequality of degree. For, he who doubts that the horse is superior in its nature to wood, and man more excellent than the horse, assuredly does not deserve the name of man. Therefore, although it cannot be denied that some natures are superior to others, nevertheless reason
convinces us that some nature is so preeminent among these, that it has no superior. For, if the distinction of degrees is infinite, so that there is among them no degree, than which no higher can be found, our course of reasoning reaches this conclusion: that the multitude of natures themselves is not limited by any bounds. But only an absurdly foolish man can fail to regard such a conclusion as absurdly foolish. There is, then, necessarily some nature which is so superior to some nature or
natures, that there is none in comparison with which it is ranked as inferior.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.v-p3">Now, this nature which is such, either is single, or there are more natures than one of this sort, and they are of equal degree.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.v-p4">But, if they are more than one and equal, since they cannot be equal through any diverse causes, but only through some cause which is one and the same, that one cause, through which they are equally so 
<pb n="44" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_44.html" id="iv.v-Page_44"/>great, either is itself what they are, that is, the very essence of these natures; or else it is another than what they are.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.v-p5">But if it is nothing else than their very essence itself, just as they have not more than one essence, but a single essence, so they have not more than one nature, but a single nature. For I here understand <i>nature</i> as identical with <i>essence.</i></p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.v-p6">If, however, that through which these natures are so great is another than that which they are, then, certainly, they are less than that through which they are so great. For, whatever is great through something else is less than that through which it is great. Therefore, they are not so great that there is nothing else greater than they.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.v-p7">But if, neither through what they are nor through anything other than themselves, can there be more such natures than one, than which nothing else shall be more excellent, then in no wise can there be more than one nature of this kind. We conclude, then, that there is some nature which is one and single, and which is so superior to others that it is inferior to none. But that which is such is the greatest and best of all existing beings. Hence, there is a certain
nature which is the highest of all existing beings. This, however, it cannot be, unless it is what it is through itself, and all existing beings are what they are through it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.v-p8">For since, as our reasoning showed us not long since, that which exists through itself, and through which all other things exist, is the highest of all existing beings; either conversely, that which is the highest exists through itself, and all others through it; or, there will be more than one supreme being. But it 
<pb n="45" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_45.html" id="iv.v-Page_45"/>is manifest that there cannot be more than one supreme being. There is, therefore, a certain Nature, or Substance, or Essence, which is through
itself good and great, and through itself is what it is; and through which exists whatever is truly good, or great, or has any existence at all; and which is the supreme good being, the supreme great being, being or subsisting as supreme, that is, the highest of all existing beings.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.vi-p1">Just as this Nature exists through itself, and other beings through it, so it derives existence from itself, and other beings from it.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.vi-p2">SEEING, then, that the truth already discovered has been satisfactorily demonstrated, it is profitable to examine whether this Nature, and all things that have any existence, derive existence from no other source than it, just as they do not exist except through it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.vi-p3">But it is clear that one may say, that what derives existence from something exists through the same thing; and what exists through something also derives existence from it. For instance, what derives existence from matter, and exists through the artificer, may also be said to exist through matter, and to derive existence from the artificer, since it exists through both, and derives existence from both. That is, it is endowed with existence by both, although it
exists through matter and from the artificer in another sense than that in which it exists through, and from, the artificer.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.vi-p4">It follows, then, that just as all existing beings are what they are, through the supreme Nature, and as that Nature exists through itself, but other beings through another than themselves, so all existing beings 
<pb n="46" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_46.html" id="iv.vi-Page_46"/>derive existence from this supreme Nature. And therefore, this Nature derives existence from itself, but other beings from it.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.vii-p1">This Nature was not brought into existence with the help of any external cause, yet it does not exist through nothing, or derive existence from nothing.&#8212;How existence through self, and derived from self, is conceivable.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.vii-p2">SINCE the same meaning is not always attached to the phrase, &#8220;existence through&#8221; something, or, to the phrase, &#8220;existence derived from&#8221; something, very diligent inquiry must be made, in what way all existing beings exist through the supreme Nature, or derive existence from it. For, what exists through itself, and what exists through another, do not admit the same ground of existence. Let us first consider, separately, this supreme Nature, which exists through self;
then these beings which exist through another.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.vii-p3">Since it is evident, then, that this Nature is whatever it is, through itself, and all other beings are what they are, through it, how does it exist through itself? For, what is said to exist through anything apparently exists through an efficient agent, or through matter, or through some other external aid, as through some instrument. But, whatever exists in any of these three ways exists through another than itself, and is of later existence, and, in some sort,
less than that through which it obtains existence.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.vii-p4"> But, in no wise does the supreme Nature exist through another, nor is it later or less than itself or anything else. Therefore, the supreme Nature could be created neither by itself, nor by another; nor could 
<pb n="47" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_47.html" id="iv.vii-Page_47"/>itself or any other be the matter whence it should be created; nor did it assist itself in any way; nor did anything assist it to be what it was not before.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.vii-p5">What is to be inferred? For that which cannot have come into existence by any creative agent, or from any matter, or with any external aids, seems either to be nothing, or, if it has any existence, to exist through nothing, and derive existence from nothing. And although, in accordance with the observations I have already made, in the light of reason, regarding the supreme Substance, I should think such propositions could in no wise be true in the case of supreme
Substance; yet, I would not neglect to give a connected demonstration of this matter.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.vii-p6">For, seeing that this my meditation has suddenly brought me to an important and interesting point, I am unwilling to pass over carelessly even any simple or almost foolish objection that occurs to me, in my argument; in order that by leaving no ambiguity in my discussion up to this point, I may have the better assured strength to advance toward what follows; and in order that if, perchance, I shall wish to convince any one of the truth of my speculations, even one
of the slower minds, through the removal of every obstacle, however slight, may acquiesce in what it finds here.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.vii-p7">That this Nature, then, without which no nature exists, is nothing, is as false as it would be absurd to say that whatever is is nothing. And, moreover, it does not exist through nothing, because it is utterly inconceivable that what is something should exist through nothing. But, if in any way it derives existence from nothing, it does so through itself, or through another, or through nothing. But it is evident that 
<pb n="48" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_48.html" id="iv.vii-Page_48"/>in no wise does anything exist through
nothing. If, then, in any way it derives existence from nothing, it does so either through itself or through another.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.vii-p8">But nothing can, through itself, derive existence from nothing, because if anything derives existence from nothing, through something, then that through which it exists must exist before it. Seeing that this Being, then, does not exist before itself, by no means does it derive existence from itself.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.vii-p9">But if it is supposed to have derived existence from some other nature, then it is not the supreme Nature, but some inferior one, nor is it what it is through itself, but through another.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.vii-p10">Again: if this Nature derives existence from nothing, through something, that through which it exists was a great good, since it was the cause of good. But no good can be understood as existing before that good, without which nothing is good; and it is sufficiently clear that this good, without which there is no good, is the supreme Nature which is under discussion. Therefore, it is not even conceivable that this Nature was preceded by any being, through which it
derived existence from nothing.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.vii-p11">Hence, if it has any existence through nothing, or derives existence from nothing, there is no doubt that either, whatever it is, it does not exist through itself, or derive existence from itself, or else it is itself nothing. It is unnecessary to show that both these suppositions are false. The supreme Substance, then, does not exist through any efficient agent, and does not derive existence from any matter, and was not aided in being brought into existence by any
external causes. Nevertheless, it by no means exists through 
<pb n="49" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_49.html" id="iv.vii-Page_49"/>nothing, or derives existence from nothing; since, through itself and from itself, it is whatever it is.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.vii-p12">Finally, as to how it should be understood to exist through itself, and to derive existence from itself: it did not create itself, nor did it spring up as its own matter, nor did it in any way assist itself to become what it was not before, unless, haply, it seems best to conceive of this subject in the way in which one says that <i>the light lights</i> or is <i>lucent,</i> through and from itself. For, as are the mutual relations of <i>the light</i> and<i> to
light</i> and<i> lucent</i> (<span lang="la" id="iv.vii-p12.1"><span lang="la" id="iv.vii-p12.2"><i>lux, lucere, lucens</i></span></span>), such are the relations of <i>essence,</i> and <i>to be</i> and <i>being,</i> that is, <i>existing</i> or <i>subsisting</i>. So the supreme <i>Being,</i> and <i>to be</i> in the highest degree, and <i>being</i> in the highest degree, bear much the same relations, one to another, as <i>the light</i> and <i>to light</i> and<i> lucent.</i></p>

<h3 id="iv.viii-p0.1">CHAPTER VII.</h3> 

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.viii-p1">In what way all other beings exist through this Nature and derive existence from it.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.viii-p2">THERE now remains the discussion of that whole class of beings that exist through another, as to how they exist through the supreme Substance, whether because this Substance created them all, or because it was the material of all. For, there is no need to inquire whether all exist through it, for this reason, namely, that there being another creative agent, or another existing material, this supreme Substance has merely aided in bringing about the existence of all
things: since it is inconsistent with what has already been shown, that whatever things are should exist secondarily, and not primarily, through it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.viii-p3">First, then, it seems to me, we ought to inquire 
<pb n="50" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_50.html" id="iv.viii-Page_50"/>whether that whole class of beings which exist through another derive existence from any material. But I do not doubt that all this solid world, with its parts, just as we see, consists of earth, water, fire, and air. These four elements, of course, can be conceived of without these forms which we see in actual objects, so that their formless, or even confused, nature appears to be the material of all bodies,
distinguished by their own forms.&#8212;I say that I do not doubt this. But I ask, whence this very material that I have mentioned, the material of the mundane mass, derives its existence. For, if there is some material of this material, then that is more truly the material of the physical universe.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.viii-p4">If, then, the universe of things, whether visible or invisible, derives existence from any material, certainly it not only cannot be, but it cannot even be supposed to be, from any other material than from the supreme Nature or from itself, or from some third being&#8212;but this last, at any rate, does not exist. For, indeed, nothing is even conceivable except that highest of all beings, which exists through itself, and the universe of beings which exist, not
through themselves, but through this supreme Being. Hence, that which has no existence at all is not the material of anything.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.viii-p5">From its own nature the universe cannot derive existence, since, if this were the case, it would in some sort exist through itself and so through another than that through which all things exist. But all these suppositions are false.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.viii-p6">Again, everything that derives existence from material derives existence from another, and exists later than that other. Therefore, since nothing is other 
<pb n="51" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_51.html" id="iv.viii-Page_51"/>than itself, or later than itself, it follows that nothing derives material existence from itself.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.viii-p7">But if, from the material of the supreme Nature itself, any lesser being can derive existence, the supreme good is subject to change and corruption. But this it is impious to suppose. Hence, since everything that is other than this supreme Nature is less than it, it is impossible that anything other than it in this way derives existence from it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.viii-p8">Furthermore: doubtless that is in no wise good, through which the supreme good is subjected to change or corruption. But, if any lesser nature derives existence from the material of the supreme good, inasmuch as nothing exists whencesoever, except through the supreme Being, the supreme good is subjected to change and corruption through the supreme Being itself. Hence, the supreme Being, which is itself the supreme good, is by no means good; which is a contradiction.
There is, therefore, no lesser nature which derives existence in a material way from the supreme Nature.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.viii-p9">Since, then, it is evident that the essence of those things which exist through another does not derive existence as if materially, from the supreme Essence, nor from itself, nor from another, it is manifest that it derives existence from no material. Hence, seeing that whatever is exists through the supreme Being, nor can aught else exist through this Being, except by its creation, or by its existence as material, it follows, necessarily, that nothing besides it
exists, except by its creation. And, since nothing else is or has been, except that supreme Being and the beings created by it, it could create nothing at all through any other instrument or aid than itself. But all that 
<pb n="52" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_52.html" id="iv.viii-Page_52"/>it has created, it has doubtless created either from something, as from material, or from nothing.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.viii-p10">Since, then, it is most patent that the essence of all beings, except the supreme Essence, was created by that supreme Essence, and derives existence from no material, doubtless nothing can be more clear than that this supreme Essence nevertheless produced from nothing, alone and through itself, the world of material things, so numerous a multitude, formed in such beauty, varied in such order, so fitly diversified.</p>

<h3 id="iv.ix-p0.1">CHAPTER VIII.</h3> 

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.ix-p1">How it is to be understood that this Nature created all things from nothing.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.ix-p2">BUT we are confronted with a doubt regarding this term <i>nothing.</i> For, from whatever source anything is created, that source is the cause of what is created from it, and, necessarily, every cause affords some assistance to the being of what it effects. This is so firmly believed, as a result of experience, by every one, that the belief can be wrested from no one by argument, and can scarcely be purloined by sophistry.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.ix-p3">Accordingly, if anything was created from nothing, this very nothing was the cause of what was created from it. But how could that which had no existence, assist anything in coming into existence? If, however, no aid to the existence of anything ever had its source in nothing, who can be convinced, and how, that anything is created out of nothing?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.ix-p4">Moreover, nothing either means something, or does not mean something. But if nothing is something, whatever has been created from nothing has been created from something. If, however, nothing is not 
<pb n="53" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_53.html" id="iv.ix-Page_53"/>something; since it is inconceivable that anything should be created from what does not exist, nothing is created from nothing; just as all agree that nothing comes from nothing. Whence, it evidently follows, that whatever is created is created from something; for
it is created either from something or from nothing. Whether, then, nothing is something, or nothing is not something, it apparently follows, that whatever has been created was created from something.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.ix-p5">But, if this is posited as a truth, then it is so posited in opposition to the whole argument propounded in the preceding chapter. Hence, since what was nothing will thus be something, that which was something in the highest degree will be nothing. For, from the discovery of a certain Substance existing in the greatest degree of all existing beings, my reasoning had brought me to this conclusion, that all other beings were so created by this Substance, that that
from which they were created was nothing. Hence, if that from which they were created, which I supposed to be nothing, is something, whatever I supposed to have been ascertained regarding the supreme Being, is nothing.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.ix-p6">What, then, is to be our understanding of the term <i>nothing?</i>&#8212;For I have already determined not to neglect in this meditation any possible objection, even if it be almost foolish.&#8212;In three ways, then&#8212;and this suffices for the removal of the present obstacle&#8212;can the statement that any substance was created from nothing be explained.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.ix-p7">There is one way, according to which we wish it to be understood, that what is said to have been created from nothing has not been created at all; just 
<pb n="54" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_54.html" id="iv.ix-Page_54"/>as, to one who asks regarding a dumb man, of what he speaks, the answer is given, &#8220;of nothing,&#8221; that is, he does not speak at all. According to this interpretation, to one who enquires regarding the supreme Being, or regarding what never has existed and does not exist at all, as to whence it was created, the
answer, &#8220;from nothing&#8221; may properly be given; that is, it never was created. But this answer is unintelligible in the case of any of those things that actually were created.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.ix-p8">There is another interpretation which is, indeed, capable of supposition, but cannot be true; namely, that if anything is said to have been created from nothing, it was created from nothing itself (<span lang="la" id="iv.ix-p8.1"><span lang="la" id="iv.ix-p8.2"><i>de nihilo ipso</i></span></span>), that is, from what does not exist at all, as if this very nothing were some existent being, from which something could be created. But, since this is always false, as often as it is assumed
an irreconcilable contradiction follows.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.ix-p9">There is a third interpretation, according to which a thing is said to have been created from nothing, when we understand that it was indeed created, but that there is not anything whence it was created. Apparently it is said with a like meaning, when a man is afflicted without cause, that he is afflicted &#8220;over nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.ix-p10">If, then, the conclusion reached in the preceding chapter is understood in this sense, that with the exception of the supreme Being all things have been created by that Being from nothing, that is, not from anything; just as this conclusion consistently follows the preceding arguments, so, from it, nothing inconsistent is inferred; although it may be said, without inconsistency or any contradiction, that what has been 
<pb n="55" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_55.html" id="iv.ix-Page_55"/>created by the creative Substance was
created from nothing, in the way that one frequently says a rich man has been made from a poor man, or that one has recovered health from sickness; that is, he who was poor before, is rich now, as he was not before; and he who was ill before, is well now, as he was not before.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.ix-p11">In this way, then, we can understand, without inconsistency, the statement that the creative Being created all things from nothing, or that all were created through it from nothing; that is, those things which before were nothing, are now something. For, indeed, from the very word that we use, saying that it <i>created</i> them or that they were <i>created</i>, we understand that when this Being created them, it created something, and that when they were created,
they were created only as something. For so, beholding a man of very lowly fortunes exalted with many riches and honors by some one, we say, &#8220;Lo, he has made that man out of nothing&#8221;; that is, the man who was before reputed as nothing is now, by virtue of that other&#8217;s making, truly reckoned as something.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.x-p1">Those things which were created from nothing had an existence before their creation in the thought of the Creator.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.x-p2">BUT I seem to see a truth that compels me to distinguish carefully in what sense those things which were created may be said to have been nothing before their creation. For, in no wise can anything conceivably be created by any, unless there is, in the mind of the creative agent, some example, as it were, or (as is more fittingly supposed) some model, or likeness
<pb n="56" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_56.html" id="iv.x-Page_56"/>, or rule. It is evident, then, that before the world was created, it was in the thought of the supreme
Nature, what, and of what sort, and how, it should be. Hence, although it is clear that the beings that were created were nothing before their creation, to this extent, that they were not what they now are, nor was there anything whence they should be created, yet they were not nothing, so far as the creator&#8217;s thought is concerned, through which, and according to which, they were created.</p>

<h3 id="iv.xi-p0.1">CHAPTER X.</h3> 

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.xi-p1">This thought is a kind of expression of the objects created (<span lang="la" id="iv.xi-p1.1"><span lang="la" id="iv.xi-p1.2"><span style="font-style:normal" id="iv.xi-p1.3">locutio rerum</span></span></span>), like the expression which an artisan forms in his mind for what he intends to make.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xi-p2">BUT this model of things, which preceded their creation in the thought of the creator, what else is it than a kind of expression of these things in his thought itself; just as when an artisan is about to make something after the manner of his craft, he first expresses it to himself through a concept? But by the <i>expression</i> of the mind or reason I mean, here, not the conception of words signifying the objects, but the general view in the mind, by the vision of
conception, of the objects themselves, whether destined to be, or already existing.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xi-p3">For, from frequent usage, it is recognised that we can express the same object in three ways. For we express objects either by the sensible use of sensible signs, that is, signs which are perceptible to the bodily senses; or by thinking within ourselves insensibly of these signs which, when outwardly used, are sensible; or not by employing these signs, either sensibly or 
<pb n="57" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_57.html" id="iv.xi-Page_57"/>insensibly, but by expressing the things themselves inwardly in our mind, whether by the
power of imagining material bodies or of understanding thought, according to the diversity of these objects themselves.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xi-p4">For I express <i>a man</i> in one way, when I signify him by pronouncing these words, <i>a man</i>; in another, when I think of the same words in silence; and in another, when the mind regards the man himself, either through the image of his body, or through the reason; through the image of his body, when the mind imagines his visible form; through the reason, however, when it thinks of his universal essence, which is a rational, mortal animal.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xi-p5">Now, the first two kinds of expression are in the language of one&#8217;s race. But the words of that kind of expression, which I have put third and last, when they concern objects well known, are natural, and are the same among all nations. And, since all other words owe their invention to these, where these are, no other word is necessary for the recognition of an object, and where they cannot be, no other word is of any use for the description of an object.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xi-p6">For, without absurdity, they may also be said to be the truer, the more like they are to the objects to which they correspond, and the more expressively they signify these objects. For, with the exception of those objects, which we employ as their own names, in order to signify them, like certain sounds, the vowel a for instance&#8212;with the exception of these, I say, no other word appears so similar to the object to which it is applied, or expresses it as does
that likeness which is expressed by the vision of the mind thinking of the object itself.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xi-p7">This last, then, should be called the especially 
<pb n="58" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_58.html" id="iv.xi-Page_58"/>proper and primary <i>word</i>, corresponding to the thing. Hence, if no expression of any object whatever so nearly approaches the object as that expression which consists of this sort of <i>words,</i> nor can there be in the thought of any another word so like the object, whether destined to be, or already existing, not without reason it may be thought that such an expression of objects existed with (<span lang="la" id="iv.xi-p7.1"><span lang="la" id="iv.xi-p7.2"><i>apud</i></span></span>) the supreme Substance before their creation, that they might be created; and exists, now that they have been created, that they may be known through it.</p>

<h3 id="iv.xii-p0.1">CHAPTER XI.</h3> 

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.xii-p1">The analogy, however, between the expression of the Creator and the expression of the artisan is very incomplete.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xii-p2">BUT, though it is most certain that the supreme Substance expressed, as it were, within itself the whole created world, which it established according to, and through, this same most profound expression, just as an artisan first conceives in his mind what he afterwards actually executes in accordance with his mental concept, yet I see that this analogy is very incomplete.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xii-p3">For the supreme Substance took absolutely nothing from any other source, whence it might either frame a model in itself, or make its creatures what they are; while the artisan is wholly unable to conceive in his imagination any bodily thing, except what he has in some way learned from external objects, whether all at once, or part by part; nor can he perform the work mentally conceived, if there is a lack of material, or of anything without which a work premeditated
cannot be performed. For, though a man 
<pb n="59" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_59.html" id="iv.xii-Page_59"/>can, by meditation or representation, frame the idea of some sort of animal, such as has no existence; yet, by no means has he the power to do this, except by uniting in this idea the parts that he has gathered in his memory from objects known externally.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xii-p4">Hence, in this respect, these inner expressions of the works they are to create differ in the creative substance and in the artisan: that the former expression, without being taken or aided from any external source, but as first and sole cause, could suffice the Artificer for the performance of his work, while the latter is neither first, nor sole, nor sufficient, cause for the inception of the artisan&#8217;s work. Therefore, whatever has been created through the former
expression is only what it is through that expression, while whatever has been created through the latter would not exist at all, unless it were something that it is not through this expression itself.</p>

Therefore,
the consideration of this expression should not, in my opinion, be carelessly passed over. But before it can be discussed, I think some of the properties

For, by a like course of reasoning to that by which it has been gathered that all existing beings exist through some one being, hence that
being alone exists through itself, and others through another than themselves&#8212;by a like course of reasoning, I say, it can be proved that whatever things live, live through some one being; hence that being alone lives through itself, and others through another than themselves.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xiv-p3">But, since it cannot but be that those things which have been created live through another, and that by which they have been created lives through itself, necessarily, just as nothing has been created except through the creative, present Being, so nothing lives except through its preserving presence.</p>

Hence, if any relative predication is made regarding the supreme Nature, it is not significant of its substance.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xvi-p4">Therefore, it is manifest that this very expression, that this Nature, is the <i>highest</i> of all beings, or <i>greater</i> than those which have been created by it; or any 
<pb n="62" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_62.html" id="iv.xvi-Page_62"/>other relative term that can, in like manner, be applied to it, does not describe its natural essence.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xvi-p5">For, if none of those things ever existed, in relation to which it is called <i>supreme</i> or <i>greater</i>, it would not be conceived as either <i>supreme</i> or <i>greater</i>, yet it would not, therefore, be less good, or suffer detriment to its essential greatness in any degree. And this truth is clearly seen from the fact that this Nature exists through no other than itself, whatever there be that is good or great. If, then, the supreme Nature can be so
conceived of as not supreme, that still it shall be in no wise greater or less than when it is conceived of as the highest of all beings, it is manifest that the term <i>supreme</i>, taken by itself, does not describe that Being which is altogether greater and better than whatever is not what it is. But, what these considerations show regarding the term <i>supreme</i> or <i>highest</i> is found to be true, in like manner, of other similar, relative expressions.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xvi-p6">Passing over these relative predications, then, since none of them taken by itself represents the essence of anything, let our attention be turned to the discussion of other kinds of predication.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xvi-p7">Now, certainly if one diligently considers separately whatever there is that is not of a relative nature, either it is such that, <i>to be it</i> is in general better than <i>not to be it</i>, or such that, in some cases, <i>not to be it</i> is better than <i>to be it</i>. But I here understand the phrases, <i>to be it</i> and <i>not to be it</i>, in the same way in which I understand <i>to be true</i> and <i>not to be true</i>, <i>to be bodily</i> and <i>not to be
bodily</i>, and the like. Indeed, to be anything is, in general, better than not to be it; as <i>to be wise</i> is better than <i>not to be so</i>; that is, it is better to be wise than not to be wise. For, though one who 
<pb n="63" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_63.html" id="iv.xvi-Page_63"/>is just, but not wise, is apparently a better man than one who is wise, but not just, yet, taken by itself, it is not better <i>not to be wise</i> than <i>to be wise</i>. For, everything that is not wise, simply in so far as it is not wise, is less than what is wise,
since everything that is not wise would be better if it were wise. In the same way, <i>to be true</i> is altogether better than <i>not to be so</i>, that is, better than <i>not to be true</i>; and <i>just</i> is better than <i>not just</i>; and<i> to live</i> than <i>not to live</i>.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xvi-p8">But, in some cases, <i>not to be</i> a certain thing is better than <i>to be it</i>, as <i>not to be gold</i> may be better than <i>to be gold</i>. For it is better for man not to be gold, than to be gold; although it might be better for something to be gold, than not to be gold&#8212;lead, for instance. For though both, namely, man and lead are not gold, man is something as much better than gold, as he would be of inferior nature, were he gold; while lead is
something as much more base than gold, as it would be more precious, were it gold.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xvi-p9">But, from the fact that the supreme Nature may be so conceived of as not supreme, that <i>supreme</i> is neither in general better than <i>not supreme</i>, nor <i>not supreme</i> better, in any case, than <i>supreme</i>&#8212;from this fact it is evident that there are many relative expressions which are by no means included in this classification. Whether, however, any are so included, I refrain from inquiring; since it is sufficient, for my purpose, that
undoubtedly none of these, taken by itself, describes the substance of the supreme Nature.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xvi-p10">Since, then, it is true of whatever else there is, that, if it is taken independently, <i>to be it</i> is better than <i>not to be it</i>; as it is impious to suppose that the substance of the supreme Nature is anything, than which what is not it is in any way better, it must be true that 
<pb n="64" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_64.html" id="iv.xvi-Page_64"/>this substance is whatever is, in general, better than what is not it. For, it alone is that, than which there is nothing better at all, and which is better than all things,
which are not what it is.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xvi-p11">It is not a material body, then, or any of those things which the bodily senses discern. For, then all these there is something better, which is not what they themselves are. For, the rational mind, as to which no bodily sense can perceive what, or of what character, or how great, it is&#8212;the less this rational mind would be if it were any of those things that are in the scope of the bodily senses, the greater it is than any of these. For by no means should this
supreme Being be said to be any of those things to which something, which they themselves are not, is superior; and it should by all means, as our reasoning shows, be said to be any of those things to which everything, which is not what they themselves are, is inferior.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xvi-p12">Hence, this Being must be living, wise, powerful, and all-powerful, true, just, blessed, eternal, and whatever, in like manner, is absolutely better than what is not it. Why, then, should we make any further inquiry as to what that supreme Nature is, if it is manifest which of all things it is, and which it is not?</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.xvii-p1">For this Being it is the same to be just that it is to be justice; and so with regard to attributes that can be expressed in the same way: and none of these shows of what character, or how great, but what this Being is.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xvii-p2">BUT perhaps, when this Being is called just, or great, or anything like these, it is not shown what it is, but of what character, or how great it is. For 
<pb n="65" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_65.html" id="iv.xvii-Page_65"/>every such term seems to be used with reference to quantity or magnitude; because everything that is just is so through justness, and so with other like cases, in the same way. Hence, the supreme Nature itself is not just, except through justness.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xvii-p3">It seems, then, that by <i>participation</i> in this quality, that is, justness, the supremely good Substance is called just. But, if this is so, it is just through another, and not through itself. But this is contrary to the truth already established, that it is good, or great or whatever it is at all, through itself and not through another. So, if it is not just, except through justness, and cannot be just, except through itself, what can be more clear than that
this Nature is itself justness? And, when it is said to be just through justness, it is the same as saying that it is just through itself. And, when it is said to be just through itself, nothing else is understood than that it is just through justness. Hence, if it is inquired what the supreme Nature, which is in question, is in itself, what truer answer can be given, than <i>Justness</i>?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xvii-p4">We must observe, then, how we are to understand the statement, that the Nature which is itself justness is just. For, since a man cannot be justness, but can possess justness, we do not conceive of a just man as <i>being</i> justness, but as possessing justness. Since, on the other hand, it cannot properly be said of the supreme Nature that it possesses justness, but that it is justness, when it is called just it is properly conceived of as being justness, but not
as possessing justness. Hence, if, when it is said to be justness, it is not said of what character it is, but <i>what</i> it is, it follows that, when it is called just, it is not said of what character it is, but what it is.</p>

<pb n="66" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_66.html" id="iv.xvii-Page_66"/> 

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xvii-p5">Therefore, seeing that it is the same to say of the supreme Being, that it is just and that it is justness; and, when it is said that it is justness, it is nothing else than saying that it is just; it makes no difference whether it is said to be justness or to be just. Hence, when one is asked regarding the supreme Nature, what it is, the answer, <i>Just</i>, is not less fitting than the answer, <i>Justness</i>. Moreover, what we see to have been proved in the case
of justness, the intellect is compelled to acknowledge as true of all attributes which are similarly predicated of this supreme Nature. Whatever such attribute is predicated of it, then, it is shown, not of what character, or how great, but <i>what</i> it is.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xvii-p6">But it is obvious that whatever good thing the supreme Nature is, it is in the highest degree. It is, therefore, supreme Being, supreme Justness, supreme Wisdom, supreme Truth, supreme Goodness, supreme Greatness, supreme Beauty, supreme Immortality, supreme Incorruptibility, supreme Immutability, supreme Blessedness, supreme Eternity, supreme Power, supreme Unity; which is nothing else than supremely being, supremely living, etc.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.xviii-p1">It is simple in such a way that all things that can be said of its essence are one and the same in it: and nothing can be said of its substance except in terms of what it is.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xviii-p2">IS it to be inferred, then, that if the supreme Nature is so many goods, it will therefore be compounded of more goods than one? Or is it true, rather, that there are not more goods than one, but a single good 
<pb n="67" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_67.html" id="iv.xviii-Page_67"/>described by many names? For, everything which is composite requires for its subsistence the things of which it is compounded, and, indeed, owes to them the fact of its existence, because, whatever it is, it is through these things; and they are not what
they are through it, and therefore it is not at all supreme. If, then, that Nature is compounded of more goods than one, all these facts that are true of every composite must be applicable to it. But this impious falsehood the whole cogency of the truth that was shown above refutes and overthrows, through a clear argument.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xviii-p3">Since, then, that Nature is by no means composite and yet is by all means those so many goods, necessarily all these are not more than one, but are one. Any one of them is, therefore, the same as all, whether taken all at once or separately. Therefore, just as whatever is attributed to the essence of the supreme Substance is one; so this substance is whatever it is essentially in one way, and by virtue of one consideration. For, when a man is said to be a material
body, and rational, and human, these three things are not said in one way, or in virtue of one consideration. For, in accordance with one fact, he is a material body; and in accordance with another, rational; and no one of these, taken by itself, is the whole of what man is.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xviii-p4">That supreme Being, however, is by no means anything in such a way that it is not this same thing, according to another way, or another consideration; because, whatever it is essentially in any way, this is all of what it is. Therefore, nothing that is truly said of the supreme Being is accepted in terms of quality or quantity, but only in terms of <i>what</i> it is. For, whatever it is in terms of either quality or quantity 
<pb n="68" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_68.html" id="iv.xviii-Page_68"/>would constitute still another
element, in terms of what it is; hence, it would not be simple, but composite.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.xix-p1">It is without beginning and without end.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xix-p2">FROM what time, then, has this so simple Nature which creates and animates all things existed, or until what time is it to exist? Or rather, let us ask neither from what time, nor to what time, it exists; but is it without beginning and without end? For, if it has a beginning, it has this either from or through itself, or from or through another, or from or through nothing.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xix-p3">But it is certain, according to truths already made plain, that in no wise does it derive existence from another, or from nothing; or exist through another, or through nothing. In no wise, therefore, has it had inception through or from another, or through or from nothing.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xix-p4">Moreover, it cannot have inception from or through itself, although it exists from and through itself. For it so exists from and through itself, that by no means is there one essence which exists from and through itself, and another through which, and from which, it exists. But, whatever begins to exist from or through something, is by no means identical with that from or through which it begins to exist. Therefore, the supreme Nature does not begin through or from,
itself.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xix-p5">Seeing, then, that it has a beginning neither through nor from itself, and neither through nor from nothing, it assuredly has no beginning at all. But neither will it have an end. For, if it is to have end, it is not supremely immortal and supremely incorruptible
<pb n="69" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_69.html" id="iv.xix-Page_69"/>. But we have proved that it is supremely immortal and supremely incorruptible. Therefore, it will not have an end.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xix-p6">Furthermore, if it is to have an end, it will perish either willingly or against its will. But certainly that is not a simple, unmixed good, at whose will the supreme good perishes. But this Being is itself the true and simple, unmixed good. Therefore, that very Being, which is certainly the supreme good, will not die of its own will. If, however, it is to perish against its will, it is not supremely powerful, or all-powerful. But cogent reasoning has asserted it
to be powerful and all-powerful. Therefore, it will not die against its will. Hence, if neither with nor against its will the supreme Nature is to have an end, in no way will it have an end.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xix-p7">Again, if the supreme nature has an end or a beginning, it is not true eternity, which it has been irrefutably proved to be above.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xix-p8">Then, let him who can conceive of a time when this began to be true, or when it was not true, namely, that something was destined to be; or when this shall cease to be true, and shall not be true, namely, that something has existed. But, if neither of these suppositions is conceivable, and both these facts cannot exist without truth, it is impossible even to conceive that truth has either beginning or end. And then, if truth had a beginning, or shall have an end;
before it began it was true that truth did not exist, and after it shall be ended it will be true that truth will not exist. Yet, anything that is <i>true</i> cannot exist without truth. Therefore, truth existed before truth existed, and truth will exist after truth shall be ended, which is a most contradictory conclusion. Whether, then, 
<pb n="70" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_70.html" id="iv.xix-Page_70"/>truth is said to have, or understood not to have, beginning or end, it cannot be limited by any beginning or end. Hence, the same follows as regards the
supreme Nature, since it is itself the supreme Truth.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.xx-p1">In what sense nothing existed before or will exist after this Being.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xx-p2">BUT here we are again confronted by the term <i>nothing</i>, and whatever our reasoning thus far, with the concordant attestation of truth and necessity, has concluded nothing to be. For, if the propositions duly set forth above have been confirmed by the fortification of logically necessary truth, not anything existed before the supreme Being, nor will anything exist after it. Hence, nothing existed before, and nothing will exist after, it. For, either something or
nothing must have preceded it; and either something or nothing must be destined to follow it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xx-p3">But, he who says that nothing existed before it appears to make this statement, &#8220;that there was before it a time when nothing existed, and that there will be after it a time when nothing will exist.&#8221; Therefore, when nothing existed, that Being did not exist, and when nothing shall exist, that Being will not exist. How is it, then, that it does not take inception from nothing or how is it that it will not come to nothing?&#8212;if that Being did not yet exist, when
nothing already existed; and the same Being shall no longer exist, when nothing shall still exist. Of what avail is so weighty a mass of arguments, if this <i>nothing</i> so easily demolishes their structure? For, if it is established that the supreme Being succeeds <i>nothing</i><note n="11" id="iv.xx-p3.1">,[Nothing is here treated as an entity, supposed actually to precede the supreme Being in existence. The fallacy involved is shown below.&#8212;<i>Tr.</i>]</note> which 
<pb n="71" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_71.html" id="iv.xx-Page_71"/>precedes it, and yields its place to
<i>nothing</i>, which follows it, whatever has been posited as true above is necessarily unsettled by empty nothing.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xx-p4">But, rather ought this <i>nothing</i> to be resisted, lest so many structures of cogent reasoning be stormed by <i>nothing</i>; and the supreme good, which has been sought and found by the light of truth, be lost for <i>nothing</i>. Let it rather be declared, then, that nothing did not exist before the supreme Being, and that nothing will not exist after it, rather than that, when a place is given before or after it to nothing, that Being which through itself
brought into existence what was nothing, should be reduced through nothing to nothing.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xx-p5">For this one assertion, namely, that nothing existed before the supreme Being, carries two meanings. For, one sense of this statement is that, before the supreme Being, there was a time when nothing was. But another understanding of the same statement is that, before the supreme Being, not anything existed. Just as, supposing I should say, &#8220;Nothing has taught me to fly,&#8221; I could explain this assertion either in this way, that nothing, as an entity in itself, which
signifies <i>not anything</i>, has taught me actually to fly&#8212;which would be false; or in this way, that not anything has taught me to fly, which would be true.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xx-p6">The former interpretation, therefore, which is followed by the inconsistency discussed above, is rejected by all reasoning as false. But there remains the other interpretation, which unites in perfect consistency with the foregoing arguments, and which, from the force of their whole correlation, must be true.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xx-p7">Hence, the statement that nothing existed before that Being must be received in the latter sense. Nor 
<pb n="72" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_72.html" id="iv.xx-Page_72"/>should it be so explained, that it shall be understood that there was any time when that Being did not exist, and nothing did exist; but, so that it shall be understood that, before that Being, there was not anything. The same sort of double signification is found in the statement that nothing will exist after that Being.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xx-p8">If, then, this interpretation of the term <i>nothing</i>, that has been given, is carefully analysed, most truly neither something nor nothing preceded or will follow the supreme Being, and the conclusion is reached, that nothing existed before or will exist after it. Yet, the solidity of the truths already established is in no wise impaired by the emptiness of <i>nothing</i>.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xxi-p2">BUT, although it has been concluded above that this creative Nature exists everywhere, and in all things, and through all; and from the fact that it neither began, nor will cease to be, it follows that it always has been, and is, and will be; yet, I perceive a certain secret murmur of contradiction which compels me to inquire more carefully where and when that Nature exists.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxi-p3">The supreme Being, then, exists either everywhere and always, or merely at some place and time, or nowhere and never: or, as I express it, either in every place and at every time, or finitely, in some place and at some time, or in no place and at no time.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxi-p4">But what can be more obviously contradictory, than that what exists most really and supremely exists nowhere and never? It is, therefore, false that it exists
<pb n="73" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_73.html" id="iv.xxi-Page_73"/> nowhere and never. Again, since there is no good, nor anything at all without it; if this Being itself exists nowhere or never, then nowhere or never is there any good, and nowhere and never is there anything at all.

false, that that Being exists nowhere and never.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxi-p5">It therefore exists finitely, at some time and place, or everywhere and always. But, if it exists finitely, at some place or time, there and then only, where and when it exists, can anything exist.

Whence it will follow, that there is some place and time where and when nothing at all exists. But seeing that this is false&#8212;for place and time themselves
are existing things&#8212;the supreme Nature cannot exist finitely, at some place or time. But, if it is said that it of itself exists finitely, at some place and time, but that, through its power, it is wherever and whenever anything is, this is not true.

<pb n="74" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_74.html" id="iv.xxii-Page_74"/>in every place and at every time, it has parts; which is false. It does not, therefore, exist everywhere and always in part.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxii-p4">But how does it exist as a whole, everywhere and always? For, either it is to be understood that it exists as a whole at once, in all places or at all times, and by parts in individual places and times; or, that it exists as a whole, in individual places and times as well.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxii-p5">But, if it exists by parts in individual places or times, it is not exempt from composition and division of parts; which has been found to be in a high degree alien to the supreme Nature. Hence, it does not so exist, as a whole, in all places and at all times that it exists by parts in individual places and times.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxii-p6">We are confronted, then, by the former alternative, that is, how the supreme Nature can exist, as a whole, in every individual place and time. This is doubtless impossible, unless it either exists at once or at different times in individual places or times. But, since the law of place and the law of time, the investigation of which it has hitherto been possible to prosecute in a single discussion, because they advanced on exactly the same lines, here separate one
from another and seem to avoid debate, as if by evasion in diverse directions, let each be investigated independently in discussion directed on itself alone.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxii-p7">First, then, let us see whether the supreme Nature can exist, as a whole, in individual places, either at once in all, or at different times, in different places. Then, let us make the same inquiry regarding the times at which it can exist.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxii-p8">If, then, it exists as a whole in each individual place, then, for each individual place there is an individual
<pb n="75" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_75.html" id="iv.xxii-Page_75"/> whole. For, just as place is so distinguished from place that there are individual places, so that which exists as a whole, in one place, is so distinct from that which exists as a whole at the same time, in another place, that there are individual wholes. For, of what exists as a whole, in any place, there is no part that does not exist in that
place. And that of which there is no part that does not exist in a given place, is no part of what exists at the same time outside this place.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxii-p9">What exists as a whole, then, in any place, is no part of what exists at the same time outside that place. But, of that of which no part exists outside any given place, no part exists, at the same time, in another place. How, then, can what exists as a whole, in any place, exist simultaneously, as a whole, in another place, if no part of it can at that time exist in another place?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxii-p10">Since, then, one whole cannot exist as a whole in different places at the same time, it follows that, for individual places, there are individual wholes, if anything is to exist as a whole in different individual places at once. Hence, if the supreme Nature exists as a whole, at one time, in every individual place, there are as many supreme Natures as there can be individual places; which it would be irrational to believe. Therefore, it does not exist, as a whole,
at one time in individual places.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxii-p11">If, however, at different times it exists, as a whole, in individual places, then, when it is in one place, there is in the meantime no good and no existence in other places, since without it absolutely nothing exists. But the absurdity of this supposition is proved by the existence of places themselves, which are not 
<pb n="76" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_76.html" id="iv.xxii-Page_76"/>nothing, but something. Therefore, the supreme Nature does not exist, as a whole, in individual places at different times.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxii-p12">But, if neither at the same time nor at different times does it exist, as a whole, in individual places, it is evident that it does not at all exist, as a whole, in each individual place. We must now examine, then, whether this supreme Nature exists, as a whole, at individual times, either simultaneously or at distinct times for individual times.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxii-p13">But, how can anything exist, as a whole, simultaneously, at individual times, if these times are not themselves simultaneous? But, if this Being exists, as a whole, separately and at distinct times for individual times, just as a man exists as a whole yesterday, to-day, and to-morrow; it is properly said that it was and is and will be. Its age, then, which is no other than its eternity, does not exist, as a whole, simultaneously, but it is distributed in parts
according to the parts of time.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxii-p14">But its eternity is nothing else than itself. The supreme Being, then, will be divided into parts, according to the divisions of time. For, if its age is prolonged through periods of time, it has with this time present, past, and future. But what else is its age than its duration of existence, than its eternity? Since, then, its eternity is nothing else than its essence, as considerations set forth above irrefutably prove; if its eternity has past, present, and
future, its essence also has, in consequence, past, present, and future.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxii-p15">But what is past is not present or future; and what is present is not past or future; and what is future is not past or present. How, then, shall that

to times? Or rather, if these earlier propositions are true, how can these latter be possible? By no means, then, is past or future attributable to the creative Being, either its age or its eternity. For why has it not a present, if it truly <i>is</i>? But <i>was</i> means past, and <i>will be</i> future. Therefore that Being never was, nor will be. Hence, it does not exist at distinct times, just as it does not exist, as a whole, simultaneously in different individual times.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxii-p16">If, then, as our discussion has proved, it neither so exists, as a whole, in all places or times that it exists, as a whole, at one time in all, or by parts in individual places and times; nor so that it exists, as a whole, in individual times and places, it is manifest that it does not in any way exist, as a whole, in every time or place.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.xxiii-p1">How it exists in every place and time, and in none.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xxiii-p2">HOW, then, shall these prepositions, that are so necessary according to our exposition, and so necessary according to our proof, be reconciled? Perhaps the supreme Nature exists in place and time in some such way, that it is not prevented from so existing simultaneously, as a whole, in different places or times, that there are not more wholes than one; and that its age, which does not exist, except as true eternity, is not distributed among past, present, and
future.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxiii-p3">For, to this law of space and time, nothing seems to be subject, except the beings which so exist in space or time that they do not transcend extent of space or duration of time. Hence, though of beings of this class it is with all truth asserted that one and the same whole cannot exist simultaneously, as a whole, in different places or times; in the case of those beings which are not of this class, no such conclusion is necessarily reached.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxiii-p4">For it seems to be rightly said, that place is predicable only of objects whose magnitude place contains by including it, and includes by containing it; and that time is predicable only of objects whose duration
<pb n="79" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_79.html" id="iv.xxiii-Page_79"/> time ends by measuring it, and measures by ending it. Hence, to any being, to whose spatial extent or duration no bound can be set, either by space or time, no place or time is properly attributed. For, seeing that place does not act upon it as place,
nor time as time, it is not irrational to say, that no place is its place, and no time its time.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxiii-p5">But, what evidently has no place or time is doubtless by no means compelled to submit to the law of place or time. No law of place or time, then, in any way governs any nature, which no place or time limits by some kind of restraint. But what rational consideration can by any course of reasoning fail to reach the conclusion, that the Substance which creates and is supreme among all beings, which must be alien to, and free from, the nature and law of all things which
itself created from nothing, is limited by no restraint of space or time; since, more truly, its power, which is nothing else than its essence, contains and includes under itself all these things which it created?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxiii-p6">Is it not impudently foolish, too, to say either, that space circumscribes the magnitude of truth, or, that time measures its duration&#8212;truth, which regards no greatness or smallness of spatial or temporal extent at all?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxiii-p7">Seeing, then, that this is the condition of place or time; that only whatever is limited by their bounds neither escapes the law of parts&#8212;such as place follows, according to magnitude, or such as time submits to, according to duration&#8212;nor can in any way be contained, as a whole, simultaneously by different places or times; but whatever is in no wise confined by the restraint of place or time, is not compelled by any law of places or times to
multiplicity of parts, 
<pb n="80" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_80.html" id="iv.xxiii-Page_80"/>nor is it prevented from being present, as a whole and simultaneously, in more places or times than one&#8212;seeing, I say, that this is the condition governing place or time, no doubt the supreme Substance, which is encompassed by no restraint of place or time, is bound by none of their laws.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxiii-p8">Hence, since inevitable necessity requires that the supreme Being, as a whole, be lacking to no place or time, and no law of place or time prevents it from being simultaneously in every place or time; it must be simultaneously present in every individual place or time. For, because it is present in one place, it is not therefore prevented from being present at the same time, and in like manner in this, or that other, place or time.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxiii-p9">Nor, because it was, or is, or shall be, has any part of its eternity therefore vanished from the present, with the past, which no longer is; nor does it pass with the present, which is, for an instant; nor is it to come with the future, which is not yet.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxiii-p10">For, by no means is that Being compelled or forbidden by a law of space or time to exist, or not to exist, at any place or time&#8212;the Being which, in no wise, includes its own existence in space or time. For, when the supreme Being is said to exist in space or time, although the form of expression regarding it, and regarding local and temporal natures, is the same, because of the usage of language, yet the sense is different, because of the unlikeness of the
objects of discussion. For in the latter case the same expression has two meanings, namely: (1) that these objects are present in those places and times in which they are said to be, and (2) that they are contained by these places and times themselves.</p>

<pb n="81" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_81.html" id="iv.xxiii-Page_81"/> 

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxiii-p11">But in the case of the supreme Being, the first sense only is intended, namely, that it is present; not that it is also contained. If the usage of language permitted, it would, therefore, seem to be more fittingly said, that it exists <i>with</i> place or time, than that it exists <i>in</i> place or time. For the statement that a thing exists <i>in</i> another implies that it is <i>contained</i>, more than does the statement that it exists <i>with</i> another.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxiii-p12">In no place or time, then, is this Being properly said to exist, since it is contained by no other at all. And yet it may be said, after a manner of its own, to be in every place or time, since whatever else exists is sustained by its presence, lest it lapse into nothingness. It exists in every place and time, because it is absent from none; and it exists in none, because it has no place or time, and has not taken to itself distinctions of place or time, neither
here nor there, nor anywhere, nor then, nor now, nor at any time; nor does it exist in terms of this fleeting present, in which we live, nor has it existed, nor will it exist, in terms of past or future, since these are restricted to things finite and mutable, which it is not.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxiii-p13">And yet, these properties of time and place can, in some sort, be ascribed to it, since it is just as truly present in all finite and mutable beings as if it were circumscribed by the same places, and suffered change by the same times.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxiii-p14">We have sufficient evidence, then, to dispel the contradiction that threatened us; as to how the highest Being of all exists, everywhere and always, and nowhere and never, that is, in every place and time, and in no place or time, according to the consistent truth of different senses of the terms employed.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.xxiv-p1">How it is better conceived to exist everywhere than in every place</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xxiv-p2">BUT, since it is plain that this supreme Nature is not more truly in all places than in all existing things, not as if it were contained by them, but as containing all, by permeating all, why should it not be said to be everywhere, in this sense, that it may be understood rather to be in all existing things, than merely in all places, since this sense is supported by the truth of the fact, and is not forbidden by the proper signification of the word of place?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxiv-p3">For we often quite properly apply terms of place to objects which are not places; as, when I say that the understanding is <i>there</i> in the soul, <i>where</i> rationality is. For, though <i>there</i> and <i>where</i> are adverbs of place, yet, by no local limitation, does the mind contain anything, nor is either rationality or understanding contained.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxiv-p4">Hence, as regards the truth of the matter, the supreme Nature is more appropriately said to be everywhere, in this sense, that it is in all existing things, than in this sense, namely that it is merely in all places.

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xxv-p2">IT is also evident that this supreme Substance is without beginning and without end; that it has neither 
<pb n="83" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_83.html" id="iv.xxv-Page_83"/>past, nor future, nor the temporal, that is, transient present in which we live; since its age, or eternity, which is nothing else than itself, is immutable and without parts. Is not, therefore, the term which seems to mean <i>all time</i> more properly understood, when applied to this Substance, to signify eternity, which is never unlike itself, rather than a
changing succession of times, which is ever in some sort unlike itself?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxv-p3">Hence, if this Being is said to exist always; since, for it, it is the same to exist and to live, no better sense can be attached to this statement, than that it exists or lives eternally, that is, it possesses interminable life, as a perfect whole at once. For its eternity apparently is an interminable life, existing at once as a perfect whole.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxv-p4">For, since it has already been shown that this Substance is nothing else than its own life and its own eternity, is in no wise terminable, and does not exist, except as at once and perfectly whole, what else is true eternity, which is consistent with the nature of that Substance alone, than an interminable life, existing as at once and perfectly whole?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxv-p5">For this truth is, at any rate, clearly perceived from the single fact that true eternity belongs only to that substance which alone, as we have proved, was not created, but is the creator, since true eternity is conceived to be free from the limitations of beginning and end; and this is proved to be consistent with the nature of no created being, from the very fact that all such have been created from nothing.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xxvi-p2">BUT does not this Being, which has been shown to exist as in every way substantially identical with itself, sometimes exist as different from itself, at any rate accidentally? But how is it supremely immutable, if it can, I will not say, <i>be</i>, but, be conceived of, as variable by virtue of accidents? And, on the other hand, does it not partake of accident, since even this very fact that it is greater than all other natures and that it is unlike them seems to be an
accident in its case (<span lang="la" id="iv.xxvi-p2.1"><span lang="la" id="iv.xxvi-p2.2"><i>illi accidere</i></span></span>)? But what is the inconsistency between susceptibility to certain facts, called <i>accidents</i>, and natural immutability, if from the undergoing of these accidents the substance undergoes no change?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxvi-p3">For, of all the facts, called accidents, some are understood not to be present or absent without some variation in the subject of the accident&#8212;all colors, for instance&#8212;while others are known not to effect any change in a thing either by occurring or not occurring&#8212;certain relations, for instance. For it is certain that I am neither older nor younger than a man who is not yet born, nor equal to him, nor like him. But I shall be able to sustain and
to lose all these relations toward him, as soon as he shall have been born, according as he shall grow, or undergo change through divers qualities.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxvi-p4">It is made clear, then, that of all those facts, called accidents, a part bring some degree of mutability in their train, while a part do not impair at all the immutability
<pb n="85" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_85.html" id="iv.xxvi-Page_85"/> of that in whose case they occur. Hence, although the supreme Nature in its simplicity has never undergone such accidents as cause mutation, yet it does not disdain occasional expression in terms of those accidents which are in no wise inconsistent with supreme immutability; and yet there is
no accident respecting its essence, whence it would be conceived of, as itself variable.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxvi-p5">Whence this conclusion, also, may be reached, that it is susceptible of no accident; since, just as those accidents, which effect some change by their occurrence or non-occurrence, are by virtue of this very effect of theirs regarded as being true <i>accidents</i>, so those facts, which lack a like effect, are found to be improperly called accidents. Therefore, this Essence is always, in every way, substantially identical with itself; and it is never in any way
different from itself, even accidentally. But, however it may be as to the proper signification of the term <i>accident</i>, this is undoubtedly true, that of the supremely immutable Nature no statement can be made, whence it shall be conceived of as mutable.</p>

Indeed, since every substance is treated either as universal, i. e., as essentially common to more than one substance, as being a man is common to individual men; or as individual, having a universal essence in common with others, as individual men have in common with individual men the fact that they are men;
does any one conceive that, in the treatment of other substances, that supreme Nature is included, which neither divides itself into more substances than one,

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xxix-p2">IT seems to follow, then, from the preceding considerations, that the Spirit which exists in so wonderfully singular and so singularly wonderful a way of its own is in some sort unique; while other beings which seem to be comparable with it are not so.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxix-p3">For, by diligent attention it will be seen that that Spirit alone exists simply, and perfectly, and absolutely; while all other beings are almost non-existent, and hardly exist at all. For, seeing that of this Spirit, because of its immutable eternity, it can in no wise be said, in terms of any alteration, that it <i>was</i> or <i>will be</i>, but simply that it <i>is</i>; it is not now, by mutation, anything which it either was not at any time, or 
<pb n="88" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_88.html" id="iv.xxix-Page_88"/>will not
be in the future. Nor does it fail to be now what it was, or will be, at any time; but, whatever it is, it is, once for all, and simultaneously, and interminably. Seeing, I say, that its existence is of this character, it is rightly said itself to exist simply, and absolutely, and perfectly.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxix-p4">But since, on the other hand, all other beings, in accordance with some cause, have at some time been, or will be, by mutation, what they are not now; or, are what they were not, or will not be, at some time; and, since this former existence of theirs is no longer a fact; and that future existence is not yet a fact; and their existence in a transient, and most brief, and scarcely existing, present is hardly a fact&#8212;since, then, they exist in such mutability,
it is not unreasonably denied that they exist simply, and perfectly, and absolutely; and it is asserted that they are almost nonexistent, that they scarcely exist at all.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxix-p5">Again, since all beings, which are other than this Spirit himself, have come from non-existence to existence, not through themselves, but through another; and, since they return from existence to non-existence, so far as their own power is concerned, unless they are sustained through another being, is it consistent with their nature to exist simply, or perfectly, or absolutely, and not rather to be almost non-existent.</p>

it is created, and nothing exists later than itself.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxx-p5">The alternative remaining is, then, that this expression of the supreme Spirit, since it cannot be a creature, is no other than the supreme Spirit.

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xxxii-p3">BUT here, it seems to me, there arises a question that is not easy to answer, and yet must not be left in any ambiguity. For all words of that sort by which we express any objects in our mind, that is, conceive of them, are likenesses and images of the objects to which they correspond; and every likeness or image is more or less true, according as it more or less closely imitates the object of which it is the likeness.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxii-p4">What, then, is to be our position regarding the Word by which all things are expressed, and through which all were created? Will it be, or will it not be, the likeness of the things that have been created through itself? For, if it is itself the true likeness of mutable things, it is not consubstantial with supreme immutability; which is false. But, if it is not altogether true, and is merely a sort of likeness of mutable things, then the Word of supreme Truth is
not altogether true; which is absurd. But if it has no likeness to mutable things, how were they created after its example?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxii-p5">But perhaps nothing of this ambiguity will remain if&#8212;as the reality of a man is said to be the living 
<pb n="92" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_92.html" id="iv.xxxii-Page_92"/>man, but the likeness or image of a man in his picture&#8212;so the reality of being is conceived of as in the Word, whose essence exists so supremely that in a certain sense it alone exists; while in these things which, in comparison with that Essence, are in some sort non-existent, and, yet were made something through, and according to, that Word, a
kind of imitation of that supreme Essence is found.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxii-p6">For, in this way the Word of supreme Truth, which is also itself supreme Truth, will experience neither gain nor loss, according as it is more or less like its creatures. But the necessary inference will rather be, that every created being exists in so much the greater degree, or is so much the more excellent, the more like it is to what exists supremely, and is supremely great.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxii-p7">For on this account, perhaps,&#8212;nay, not perhaps, but certainly,&#8212;does every mind judge natures in any way alive to excel those that are not alive, the sentient to excel the non-sentient, the rational the irrational. For, since the supreme Nature, after a certain unique manner of its own, not only exists, but lives, and is sentient and rational, it is clear that, of all existing beings, that which is in some way alive is more like this supreme Nature,
than that which is not alive at all; and what, in any way, even by a corporeal sense, cognises anything, is more like this Nature than what is not sentient at all; and what is rational, more than what is incapable of reasoning.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxii-p8">But it is clear, for a like reason, that certain natures exist in a greater or less degree than others. For, just as that is more excellent by nature which, through its natural essence, is nearer to the most excellent Being, so certainly that nature exists in a 
<pb n="93" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_93.html" id="iv.xxxii-Page_93"/>greater degree, whose essence is more like the supreme Essence. And I think that this can easily be ascertained as follows. If we should conceive any substance that is alive, and sentient, and rational,
to be deprived of its reason, then of its sentience, then of its life, and finally of the bare existence that remains, who would fail to understand that the substance that is thus destroyed, little by little, is gradually brought to smaller and smaller degrees of existence, and at last to non-existence? But the attributes which, taken each by itself, reduce an essence to less and less degrees of existence, if assumed in order, lead it to greater and greater degrees.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxii-p9">It is evident, then, that a living substance exists in a greater degree than one that is not living, a sentient than a non-sentient, and a rational than a nonrational. So, there is no doubt that every substance exists in a greater degree, and is more excellent, according as it is more like that substance which exists supremely and is supremely excellent.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxii-p10">It is sufficiently clear, then, that in the Word, through which all things were created, is not their likeness, but their true and simple essence; while, in the things created, there is not a simple and absolute essence, but an imperfect imitation of that true Essence. Hence, it necessarily follows, that this Word is not more nor less true, according to its likeness to the things created, but every created nature has a higher essence and dignity, the more it is seen
to approach that Word.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.xxxiii-p2">The supreme Spirit expresses himself by a coeternal Word.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xxxiii-p3">BUT since this is true, how can what is simple Truth be the Word corresponding to those objects, of which it is not the likeness? Since every word by which an object is thus mentally expressed is the likeness of that object, if this is not the word corresponding to the objects that have been created through it, how shall we be sure that it is the Word? For every word is a word corresponding to some object. Therefore, if there were no creature, there would be no
word.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxiii-p4">Are we to conclude, then, that if there were no creature, that Word would not exist at all, which is the supreme self-sufficient Essence? Or, would the supreme Being itself, perhaps, which is the Word still be the eternal Being, but not the Word, if nothing were ever created through that Being? For, to what has not been, and is not, and will not be, then can be no word corresponding.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxiii-p5">But, according to this reasoning, if there were never any being but the supreme Spirit, there would be no word at all in him. If there were no word in him, he would express nothing to himself; if he expressed nothing to himself, since, for him, expressing anything is the same with understanding or conceiving of it (<span lang="la" id="iv.xxxiii-p5.1"><span lang="la" id="iv.xxxiii-p5.2"><i>intelligere</i></span></span>), he would not understand or conceive of anything; if he understood or
conceived of nothing, then the supreme Wisdom, which is nothing else than this Spirit, would understand or conceive of nothing; which is most absurd.</p>

<pb n="95" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_95.html" id="iv.xxxiii-Page_95"/> 

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxiii-p6">What is to be inferred? For, if it conceived of nothing, how would it be the supreme Wisdom? Or, if there were in no wise anything but it, of what would it conceive? Would it not conceive of itself? But how can it be even imagined that the supreme Wisdom, at any time does not conceive of itself; since a rational mind can remember not only itself, but that supreme Wisdom, and conceive of that Wisdom and of itself? For, if the human mind could have no memory or
concept of that Wisdom or of itself, it would not distinguish itself at all from irrational creatures, and that Wisdom from the whole created world, in silent meditation by itself, as my mind does now.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxiii-p7">Hence, that Spirit, supreme as he is eternal, is thus eternally mindful of himself, and conceives of himself after the likeness of a rational mind; nay, not after the likeness of anything; but in the first place that Spirit, and the rational mind after its likeness. But, if he conceives of himself eternally, he expresses himself eternally. If he expresses himself eternally, his Word is eternally with him. Whether, therefore, it be thought of in connection with no
other existing being, or with other existing beings, the Word of that Spirit must be coeternal with him.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.xxxiv-p2">He utters himself and what he creates by a single consubstantial Word.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xxxiv-p3">BUT here, in my inquiry concerning the Word, by which the Creator expresses all that he creates, is suggested the word by which he, who creates all, expresses himself. Does he express himself, then, by one word, and what he creates by another; or does 
<pb n="96" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_96.html" id="iv.xxxiv-Page_96"/>he rather express whatever he creates by the same word whereby he expresses himself?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxiv-p4">For this Word also, by which he expresses himself, must be identical with himself, as is evidently true of the Word by which he expresses his creatures. For since, even if nothing but that supreme Spirit ever existed, urgent reason would still require the existence of that word by which he expresses himself, what is more true than that his Word is nothing else than what he himself is? Therefore, if he expresses himself and what he creates, by a Word consubstantial
with himself, it is manifest that of the Word by which he expresses himself, and of the Word by which he expresses the created world, the substance is one.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxiv-p5">How, then, if the substance is one, are there two words? But, perhaps, identity of substance does not compel us to admit a single Word. For the Creator himself, who speaks in these words, has the same substance with them, and yet is not the Word. But, undoubtedly the word by which the supreme Wisdom expresses itself may most fitly be called its Word on the former ground, namely, that it contains the perfect likeness of that Wisdom.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxiv-p6">For, on no ground can it be denied that when a rational mind conceives of itself in meditation the image of itself arises in its thought, or rather the thought of the mind is itself its image, after its likeness, as if formed from its impression. For, whatever object the mind, either through representation of the body or through reason, desires to conceive of truly, it at least attempts to express its likeness, so far as it is able, in the mental concept itself. And
the more truly it succeeds in this, the more truly does it think of the object itself; and, indeed, this fact is observed more 
<pb n="97" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_97.html" id="iv.xxxiv-Page_97"/>clearly when it thinks of something else which it is not, and especially when it thinks of a material body. For, when I think of a man I know, in his absence, the vision of my thought forms such an image as I have acquired in memory through my ocular vision and this image is the word corresponding to the man I express by thinking of him.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxiv-p7">The rational mind, then, when it conceives of itself in thought, has with itself its image born of itself that is, its thought in its likeness, as if formed from its impression, although it cannot, except in thought alone, separate itself from its image, which image is its word.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxiv-p8">Who, then, can deny that the supreme Wisdom, when it conceives of itself by expressing itself, begets a likeness of itself consubstantial with it, namely, its Word? And this Word, although of a subject so uniquely important nothing can be said with sufficient propriety, may still not inappropriately be called the image of that Wisdom, its representation, just as it is called his likeness.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxiv-p9">But the Word by which the Creator expresses the created world is not at all, in the same way, a word corresponding to the created world, since it is not this world&#8217;s likeness, but its elementary essence. It therefore follows, that he does not express the created world itself by a word corresponding to the created world. To what, then, does the word belong, whereby he expresses it, if he does not express it by a word, belonging to itself? For what he expresses, he
expresses by a word, and a word must belong to something, that is, it is the likeness of something. But if he expresses nothing but himself or his created world 
<pb n="98" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_98.html" id="iv.xxxiv-Page_98"/>he can express nothing, except by a word corresponding to himself or to something else.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxiv-p10">So, if he expresses nothing by a word belonging to the created world, whatever he expresses, he expresses by the Word corresponding to himself. By one and the same Word, then, he expresses himself and whatever he has made.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.xxxv-p2">How he can express the created world by his Word.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xxxv-p3">BUT how can objects so different as the creative and the created being be expressed by one Word, especially since that Word itself is coeternal with him who expresses them, while the created world is not coeternal with him? Perhaps, because he himself is supreme Wisdom and supreme Reason, in which are all things that have been created; just as a work which is made after one of the arts, not only when it is made, but before it is made, and after it is destroyed, is
always in respect of the art itself nothing else than what that art is.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxv-p4">Hence, when the supreme Spirit expresses himself, he expresses all created beings. For, both before they were created, and now that they have been created, and after they are decayed or changed in any way, they are ever in him not what they are in themselves, but what this Spirit himself is. For, in themselves they are mutable beings, created according to immutable reason; while in him is the true first being, and the first reality of existence, the more like unto
which those beings are in any way, the more really and excellently do they exist. Thus, it may reasonably be declared that, when the supreme Spirit expresses

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxvi-p4">But, since knowing is the same to the supreme Spirit as conceiving or expressing, he must know all things that he knows in the same way in which he expresses or conceives of them.

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xxxvii-p3">HENCE, it may be most clearly comprehended that how this Spirit expresses, or how he knows the created world, cannot be comprehended by human knowledge. For none can doubt that created substances exist far differently in themselves than in our knowledge. For, in themselves they exist by virtue of their own being; while in our knowledge is not their being, but their likeness.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxvii-p4">We conclude, then, that they exist more truly in themselves than in our knowledge, in the same degree 
<pb n="100" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_100.html" id="iv.xxxvii-Page_100"/>in which they exist more truly anywhere by virtue of their own being, than by virtue of their likeness. Therefore, since this is also an established truth, that every created substance exists more truly in the Word, that is, in the intelligence of the Creator, than it does in itself, in the same degree in which the creative being exists more truly than the
created; how can the human mind comprehend of what kind is that expression and that knowledge, which is so much higher and truer than created substances; if our knowledge is as far surpassed by those substances as their likeness is removed from their being?</p>

For, since it is consubstantial with him, it must be the supreme essence of that of which it is the Word. But there is no supreme Essence, except one, which is the only creator and the only beginning of all things which have been created.

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xxxix-p3">OUR careful attention is therefore demanded by a peculiarity which, though most unusual in other beings, seems to belong to the supreme Spirit and his Word. For, it is certain that in each of these separately and in both simultaneously, whatever they are so exists that it is separately perfected in both, and yet does not admit plurality in the two. For although, taken separately, he is perfectly supreme Truth and Creator, and his Word is supreme Truth and Creator; yet
both at once are not two truths or two creators.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxix-p4">But although this is true, yet it is most remarkably clear that neither he, whose is the Word, can be his own Word, nor can the Word be he, whose Word it is, although in so far as regards either what they are substantially, or what relation they bear to the created world, they ever preserve an indivisible unity. But in respect of the fact that he does not derive existence from that Word, but that Word from him, they admit an ineffable plurality, ineffable,
certainly, for although necessity requires that they be two, it can in no wise be explained why they are two.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxix-p5">For although they may perhaps be called two equals, or some other mutual relation may in like manner be attributed to them, yet if it were to be asked what it is in these very relative expressions with reference to which they are used, it cannot be expressed plurally, as one speaks of two equal lines, 
<pb n="102" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_102.html" id="iv.xxxix-Page_102"/>or two like men. For, neither are there two equal spirits nor two equal creators, nor is there any dual expression which indicates either their essence or their
relation to the created world; and there is no dual expression which designates the peculiar relation of the one to the other, since there are neither two words nor two images.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xxxix-p6">For the Word, by virtue of the fact that it <i>is</i> a word or image, bears a relation to the other, because it is Word and image only as it is the Word and image of something; and so peculiar are these attributes to the one that they are by no means predicable of the other. For he, whose is the Word and image, is neither image nor Word. It is, therefore, evident that it cannot be explained why they are two, the supreme Spirit and the Word, although by certain properties
of each they are required to be two. For it is the property of the one to derive existence from the other, and the property of that other that the first derives existence from him.</p>

For it is now clearly proved, that the Word of the supreme Spirit does not derive existence from him, as do those beings which have been created by him; but as Creator from Creator, supreme Being from supreme Being.

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xliii-p6">At any rate, it is more consistent to call the supreme Spirit father than mother, for this reason, that the first and principal cause of offspring is always in the father. For, if the maternal cause is ever in some way preceded by the paternal, it is exceedingly inconsistent that the name <i>mother</i> should be attached to that parent with which, for the generation of offspring, no other cause is associated, and which no other precedes. It is, therefore, most true

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.xliv-p2">Consideration of the common attributes of both and the individual properties of each.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xliv-p3">NOW that so many and so important properties of each have been discovered, whereby a strange plurality, as ineffable as it is inevitable, is proved to exist in the supreme unity, I think it most interesting to reflect, again and again, upon so unfathomable a mystery.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xliv-p4">For observe: although it is so impossible that he who begets, and he who is begotten, are the same, and that parent and offspring are the same&#8212;so impossible that necessarily one must be the progenitor and the other the begotten, and one the Father, the other the Son; yet, here it is so necessary that he who begets and he who is begotten shall be the same, and also that parent and offspring shall be the same, that the progenitor cannot be any other than what
the begotten is, nor the Father any other than the Son.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xliv-p5">And although the one is one, and the other another, so that it is altogether evident that they are two; yet that which the one and the other are is in such a way one and the same, that it is a most obscure mystery why they are two. For, in such a way is one the Father and the other the Son, that when I speak of both I perceive that I have spoken of two; 
<pb n="107" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_107.html" id="iv.xliv-Page_107"/>and yet so identical is that which both Father and Son are, that I do not understand why they are two of whom
I have spoken.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xliv-p6">For, although the Father separately is the perfectly supreme Spirit, and the Son separately is the perfectly supreme Spirit, yet, so are the Spirit-Father and the Spirit-Son one and the same being, that the Father and the Son are not two spirits, but one Spirit. For, just as to separate properties of separate beings, plurality is not attributed, since they are not properties of two things, so, what is common to both preserves an indivisible unity, although it
belongs, as a whole, to them taken separately.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xliv-p7">For, as there are not two fathers or two sons, but one Father and one Son, since separate properties belong to separate beings, so there are not two spirits, but one Spirit; although it belongs both to the Father, taken separately, and to the Son, taken separately, to be the perfect Spirit. For so opposite are their relations, that the one never assumes the property of the other; so harmonious are they in nature, that the one ever contains the essence of the other.
For they are so diverse by virtue of the fact that the one is the Father and the other the Son, that the Father is never called the Son, nor the Son the Father; and they are so identical, by virtue of their substance, that the essence of the Son is ever in the Father, and the essence of the Father in the Son.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.xlv-p2">How one is the essence of the other.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xlv-p3">HENCE, even if one is called the essence of the other, there is no departure from truth; but the supreme 
<pb n="108" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_108.html" id="iv.xlv-Page_108"/>simplicity and unity of their common nature is thus honored. For, not as one conceives of a man&#8217;s wisdom, through which man is wise, though he cannot be wise through himself, can we thus understand the statement that the Father is essence of the Son, and the Son the essence of the Father. We cannot understand that the Son is existent through the Father, and the
Father through the Son, as if the one could not be existent except through the other, just as a man cannot be wise except through wisdom.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xlv-p4">For, as the supreme Wisdom is ever wise through itself, so the supreme Essence ever exists through itself. But, the perfectly supreme Essence is the Father, and the perfectly supreme Essence is the Son. Hence, the perfect Father and the perfect Son exist, each through himself, just as each is wise through himself.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xlv-p5">For the Son is not the less perfect essence or wisdom because he is an essence born of the essence of the Father, and a wisdom born of the wisdom of the Father; but he would be a less perfect essence or wisdom if he did not exist through himself, and were not wise through himself.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xlv-p6">For, there is no inconsistency between the subsistence of the Son through himself, and his deriving existence from his Father. For, as the Father has essence, and wisdom, and life in himself; so that not through another&#8217;s, but through his own, essence he exists; through his own wisdom he is wise; through his own life he lives; so, by generation, he grants to his Son the possession of essence, and wisdom, and life in himself, so that not through an extraneous
essence, wisdom, and life, but through his own, he subsists, is wise, and lives; otherwise, the existence of 
<pb n="109" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_109.html" id="iv.xlv-Page_109"/>Father and Son will not be the same, nor will the Son be equal to the Father. But it has already been clearly proved how false this supposition is.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xlv-p7">Hence, there is no inconsistency between the subsistence of the Son through himself, and his deriving existence from the Father, since he must have from the Father this very power of subsisting through himself. For, if a wise man should teach me his wisdom, which I formerly lacked, he might without impropriety be said to teach me by this very wisdom of his. But, although my wisdom would derive its existence and the fact of its being from his wisdom, yet when my
wisdom once existed, it would be no other essence than its own, nor would it be wise except through itself.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xlv-p8">Much more, then, the eternal Father&#8217;s eternal Son, who so derives existence from the Father that they are not two essences, subsists, is wise, and lives through himself. Hence, it is inconceivable that the Father should be the essence of the Son, or the Son the essence of the Father, on the ground that the one could not subsist through itself, but must subsist through the other. But in order to indicate how they share in an essence supremely simple and supremely
one, it may consistently be said, and conceived, that the one is so identical with the other that the one possesses the essence of the other.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xlv-p9">On these grounds, then, since there is obviously no difference between possessing an essence and being an essence, just as the one possesses the essence of the other, so the one is the essence of the other, that is, the one has the same existence with the other.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xlvi-p3">AND although, for reasons we have noted, this is true, it is much more proper to call the Son the essence of the Father than the Father the essence of the Son. For, since the Father has his being from none other than himself, it is not wholly appropriate to say that he has the being of another than himself; while, since the Son has his being from the Father, and has the same essence with his Father, he may most appropriately be said to have the essence of his
Father.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xlvi-p4">Hence, seeing that neither has an essence, except by <i>being</i> an essence; as the Son is more appropriately conceived to have the essence of the Father than the Father to have the essence of the Son, so the Son may more fitly be called the essence of the Father than the Father the essence of the son. For this single explanation proves, with sufficiently emphatic brevity, that the Son not only has the same essence with the Father, but has this very essence from
the Father; so that, to assert that the Son is the essence of the Father is the same as to assert that the Son is not a different essence from the essence of the Father nay, from the Father essence.</p>

For it is proved that the Son is the true Word, that is, the perfect intelligence, conceiving of the whole substance of the Father, or perfect cognition of that substance, and knowledge of it, and wisdom regarding it; that is, it understands, and conceives of, the very essence of the Father, and

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.xlix-p3">BUT what is to be our notion of memory? Is the Son to be regarded as the intelligence conceiving of memory, or as the memory of the Father, or as the memory of memory? Indeed, since it cannot be denied that the supreme Wisdom remembers itself, nothing can be more consistent than to regard the Father as memory, just as the Son is the Word; because the Word is apparently born of memory, a fact that is more clearly seen in the case of the human mind.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xlix-p4">For, since the human mind is not always thinking of itself, though it ever remembers itself, it is clear that, when it thinks of itself, the word corresponding to it is born of memory. Hence, it appears that, if it always thought of itself, its word would be always born of memory. For, to think of an object of which we have remembrance, this is to express it mentally; while the word corresponding to the object is the thought itself, formed after the likeness of that
object from memory.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xlix-p5">Hence, it may be clearly apprehended in the supreme Wisdom, which always thinks of itself, just as it remembers itself, that, of the eternal remembrance of it, its coeternal Word is born. Therefore, as the Word is properly conceived of as the child, the memory 
<pb n="113" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_113.html" id="iv.xlix-Page_113"/>most appropriately takes the name of parent. If, then, the child which is born of the supreme Spirit alone is the child of his memory, there can be no more logical conclusion than that his memory is
himself. For not in respect of the fact that he remembers himself does he exist in his own memory, like ideas that exist in the human memory, without being the memory itself; but he so remembers himself that he is his own memory.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.xlix-p6">It therefore follows that, just as the Son is the intelligence or wisdom of the Father, so he is that of the memory of the Father. But, regarding whatever the Son has wisdom or understanding, this he likewise remembers. The Son is, therefore, the memory of the Father, and the memory of memory, that is, the memory that remembers the Father, who is memory, just as he is the wisdom of the Father, and the wisdom of wisdom, that is, the wisdom wise regarding the wisdom
of the Father; and the Son is indeed memory, born of memory, as he is wisdom, born of wisdom, while the Father is memory and wisdom born of none.</p>

this name it shall be signified that this love is identical with Father and Son, although it has its being from them.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.lxi-p3">BUT, while this discussion engages our attention, I think that this truth, which occurs to me as I reflect, ought to be most carefully commended to memory. The Father must be so conceived of as memory, the Son as intelligence, and the Spirit as love, that it 
<pb n="122" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_122.html" id="iv.lxi-Page_122"/>shall also be understood that the Father does not need the Son, or the Spirit common to them, nor the Son the Father, or the same Spirit, nor the Spirit the Father, or the Son: as if the Father were able,

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.lxii-p3">AND here I see a question arises. For, if the Father is intelligence and love as well as memory, and the Son is memory and love as well as intelligence, and the Spirit is no less memory and intelligence than love; how is it that the Father is not a Son and a Spirit of some being? and why is not the Son the Father and the Spirit of some being? and why is not this Spirit the Father of some being, and the Son of

memory, the Son intelligence, and the Spirit love.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxii-p4">But this question is easily answered, if we consider the truths already disclosed in our discussion. For the Father, even though he is intelligence and love, is not for that reason the Son or the Spirit of any being; since he is not intelligence, begotten of any, or love, proceeding from any, but whatever he is, he is only the <i>begetter</i>, and is he from whom the other proceeds.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxii-p5">The Son also, even though by his own power he remembers and loves, is not, for that reason, the Father or the Spirit of any; since he is not memory as begetter, or love as proceeding from another after the likeness of his Spirit, but whatever being he has he is only <i>begotten</i> and is he from whom the Spirit proceeds.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxii-p6">The Spirit, too, is not necessarily Father or Son, because his own memory and intelligence are sufficient to him; since he is not memory as begetter, or intelligence as begotten, but he alone, whatever he is, <i>proceeds</i> or <i>emanates</i>.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.lxiii-p2">How it seems that of these three more sons than one are born.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.lxiii-p3">BUT perhaps the following observation will prove inconsistent with this assertion. It should not be doubted that the Father and the Son and their Spirit each expresses himself and the other 
<pb n="124" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_124.html" id="iv.lxiii-Page_124"/>two, just as each conceives of, and understands, himself and the other two. But, if this is true, are there not in the supreme Being as many words as there are expressive beings, and as many words as there are beings who are expressed?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxiii-p4">For, if more men than one give expression to some one object in thought, apparently there are as many words corresponding to that object as there are thinkers; since the word corresponding to it exists in the thoughts of each separately. Again, if one man thinks of more objects than one, there are as many words in the mind of the thinker as there are objects thought of.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxiii-p5">But in the thought of a man, when he thinks of anything outside his own mind, the word corresponding to the object thought of is not born of the object itself, since that is absent from the view of thought, but of some likeness or image of the object which exists in the memory of the thinker, or which is perhaps called to mind through a corporeal sense from the present object itself.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxiii-p6">But in the supreme Being, Father and Son and their Spirit are always so present to one another&#8212;for each one, as we have already seen, exists in the others no less than in himself&#8212;that, when they express one another, the one that is expressed seems to beget his own word, just as when he is expressed by himself. How is it, then, that the Son and the Spirit of the Son and of the Father beget nothing, if each begets his own word, when he is expressed by
himself or by another? Apparently as many words as can be proved to be born of the supreme Substance, so many Sons, according to our former reasoning, must there be begotten of this substance, and so many spirits proceeding from it.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.lxiv-p2">How among them there is only one Son of one Father, that is, one Word, and that from the Father alone.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.lxiv-p3">ON these grounds, therefore, there apparently are in that Being, not only many fathers and sons and beings proceeding from it, but other necessary attributes as well; or else Father and Son and their Spirit, of whom it is already certain that they truly exist, are not three expressive beings, although each taken separately is expressive, nor are there more beings than one expressed, when each one expresses himself and the other two.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxiv-p4">For, just as it is an inherent property of the supreme Wisdom to know and conceive, so it is assuredly natural to eternal and immutable knowledge and intelligence ever to regard as present what it knows and conceives of. For, to such a supreme Spirit expressing and beholding through conception, as it were, are the same, just as the expression of our human mind is nothing but the intuition of the thinker.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxiv-p5">But reasons already considered have shown most convincingly that whatever is essentially inherent in the supreme Nature is perfectly consistent with the nature of the Father and the Son and their Spirit taken separately; and that, nevertheless, this, if attributed to the three at once, does not admit of plurality. Now, it is established that as knowledge and intelligence are attributes of his being, so his knowing and conceiving is nothing else than his expression,
that is, his ever beholding as present what he knows and conceives of. Necessarily, therefore, just as the Father separately, and the Son separately, and their 
<pb n="126" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_126.html" id="iv.lxiv-Page_126"/>Spirit separately, is a knowing and conceiving being, and yet the three at once are not more knowing and conceiving beings than one, but one knowing and one conceiving being: so, each taken separately is expressive, and yet there are not three expressive beings at once, but one expressive being.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxiv-p6">Hence, this fact may also be clearly recognised, that when these three are expressed, either by themselves or by another, there are not more beings than one expressed. For what is therein expressed except their being? If, then, that Being is one and only one, then what is expressed is one and only one; therefore, if it is in them one and only one which expresses, and one which is expressed&#8212;for it is one wisdom which expresses and one substance which is
expressed&#8212;it follows that there are not more words than one, but one alone. Hence, although each one expresses himself and all express one another, nevertheless there cannot be in the supreme Being another Word than that already shown to be born of him whose is the Word, so that it may be called his true image and his Son.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxiv-p7">And in this truth I find a strange and inexplicable factor. For observe: although it is manifest that each one, that is, Father and Son, and the Spirit of Father and Son equally expresses himself and both the others, and that there is one Word alone among them; yet it appears that this Word itself can in no wise be called the Word of all three, but only of one.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxiv-p8">For it has been proved that it is the image and Son of him whose Word it is. And it is plain that it cannot properly be called either the image or son of itself, or of the Spirit proceeding from it. For, neither of itself nor of a being proceeding from it, is it born, 
<pb n="127" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_127.html" id="iv.lxiv-Page_127"/>nor does it in its existence imitate itself or a being proceeding from itself. For it does not imitate itself, or take on a like existence to itself, because imitation and likeness are impossible
where only one being is concerned, but require plurality of beings; while it does not imitate the spirit, nor does it exist in his likeness, because it has not its existence from that Spirit, but the Spirit from it. It is to be concluded that this sole Word corresponds to him alone, from whom it has existence by generation, and after whose complete likeness it exists.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxiv-p9">One Father, then, and not more than one Father; one Son, and not more than one Son; one Spirit proceeding from them, and not more than one such Spirit, exist in the supreme Being. And, although there are three, so that the Father is never the Son or the Spirit proceeding from them, nor the Son at any time the Father or the Spirit, nor the Spirit of Father and Son ever the Father or the Son; and each separately is so perfect that he is self-sufficient, needing
neither of the others; yet what they are is in such a way one that just as it cannot be attributed to them taken separately as plural, so, neither can it be attributed to them as plural, when the three are taken at once. And though each one expresses himself and all express one another, yet there are not among them more words than one, but one; and this Word corresponds not to each separately, nor to all together, but to one alone.</p>

what way supreme Wisdom knows its creatures, of which we necessarily know so many; who shall explain how it knows and expresses itself, of which nothing or scarcely anything can be known by man?

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxvi-p4">But how shall we meet the truth that has already been established in this very discussion, namely, that the supreme Being is so above and beyond every other nature that, whenever any statement is made concerning it in words which are also applicable to other natures, the sense of these words in this case is by no means that in which they are applied to other natures.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxvi-p5">For what sense have I conceived of, in all these words that I have thought of, except the common and familiar sense? If, then, the familiar sense of words is alien to that Being, whatever I have inferred to be attributable to it is not its property. How, then, has any truth concerning the supreme Being been discovered, if what has been discovered is so alien to that Being? What is to be inferred?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxvi-p6">Or, has there in some sort been some truth discovered regarding this incomprehensible object, and in some sort has nothing been proved regarding it? For often we speak of things which we do not express with precision as they are; but by another expression we indicate what we are unwilling or unable to express with precision, as when we speak in riddles. And often we see a thing, not precisely as it is in itself, but through a likeness or image, as when we 
<pb n="130" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_130.html" id="iv.lxvi-Page_130"/>look
upon a face in a mirror. And in this way, we often express and yet do not express, see and yet do not see, one and the same object; we express and see it through another; we do not express it, and do not see it by virtue of its own proper nature.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxvi-p7">On these grounds, then, it appears that there is nothing to disprove the truth of our discussion thus far concerning the supreme Nature, and yet this Nature itself remains not the less ineffable, if we believe that it has never been expressed according to the peculiar nature of its own being, but somehow described through another.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxvi-p8">For whatever terms seem applicable to that Nature do not reveal it to me in its proper character, but rather intimate it through some likeness. For, when I think of the meanings of these terms, I more naturally conceive in my mind of what I see in created objects, than of what I conceive to transcend all human understanding. For it is something much less, nay, something far different, that their meaning suggests to my mind, than that the conception of which my mind
itself attempts to achieve through this shadowy signification.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxvi-p9">For, neither is the term <i>wisdom</i> sufficient to reveal to me that Being, through which all things were created from nothing and are preserved from nothingness; nor is the term <i>essence</i> capable of expressing to me that Being which, through its unique elevation, is far above all things, and through its peculiar natural character greatly transcends all things.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxvi-p10">In this way, then, is that Nature ineffable, because it is incapable of description in words or by any other means; and, at the same time, an inference regarding it, which can be reached by the instruction of reason

For the more like to it anything among created beings is proved to be, the more excellent must that created being be by nature. Hence, this being, through its greater likeness, assists
the investigating mind in the approach to supreme Truth; and through its more excellent created essence, teaches the more correctly what opinion the mind itself ought to form regarding the Creator. So, undoubtedly, a greater knowledge of the creative Being is attained, the more nearly the creature through which the investigation is made approaches that Being.

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxx-p5">Hence, it is most incompatible with the nature of the supremely good, supremely wise, and omnipotent Creator, that what he has made to exist that it might love him, he should make not to exist, so long as it truly loves him; and that what he voluntarily gave to a non-loving being that it might ever love, he should take away, or permit to be taken away, from the loving being, so that necessarily it should not love; especially since it should by no means be doubted
that he himself loves every nature that loves him. Hence, it is manifest that the human soul is never deprived 
<pb n="135" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_135.html" id="iv.lxx-Page_135"/>of its life, if it forever devotes itself to loving the supreme life.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxx-p6">How, then, shall it live? For is long life so important a matter, if it is not secure from the invasion of troubles? For whoever, while he lives, is either through fear or through actual suffering subject to troubles, or is deceived by a false security, does he not live in misery? But, if any one lives in freedom from these troubles, he lives in blessedness. But it is most absurd to suppose that any nature that forever loves him, who is supremely good and
omnipotent, forever lives in misery. So, it is plain, that the human soul is of such a character that, if it diligently observes that end for which it exists, it at some time lives in blessedness, truly secure from death itself and from every other trouble.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="iv.lxxi-p2">This Being gives itself in return to the creature that loves it, that that creature may be eternally blessed.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.lxxi-p3">THEREFORE it cannot be made to appear true that he who is most just and most powerful makes no return to the being that loves him perseveringly, to which although it neither existed nor loved him, he gave existence that it might be able to be a loving being. For, if he makes no return to the loving soul, the most just does not distinguish between the soul that loves, and the soul that despises what ought to be supremely loved, nor does he love the soul that loves him;
or else it does not avail to be loved by him; all of which suppositions are inconsistent with his nature; hence he does make a return to every soul that perseveres in loving him.</p>

<pb n="136" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_136.html" id="iv.lxxi-Page_136"/> 

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxxi-p4">But what is this return? For, if he gave to what was nothing, a rational being, that it might be a loving soul, what shall he give to the loving soul, if it does not cease to love? If what waits upon love is so great, how great is the recompense given to love? And if the sustainer of love is such as we declare, of what character is the profit? For, if the rational creature, which is useless to itself without this love, is with it preeminent among all creatures,
assuredly nothing can be the reward of love except what is preeminent among all natures.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxxi-p5">For this same good, which demands such love toward itself, also requires that it be desired by the loving soul. For, who can love justice, truth, blessedness, incorruptibility, in such a way as not to wish to enjoy them? What return, then, shall the supreme Goodness make to the being that loves and desires it, except itself? For, whatever else it grants, it does not give in return, since all such bestowals neither compensate the love, nor console the loving being,
nor satisfy the soul that desires this supreme Being.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxxi-p6">Or, if it wishes to be loved and desired, so as to make some other return than its love, it wishes to be loved and desired, not for its own sake, but for the sake of another; and does not wish to be loved itself, but wishes another to be loved; which it is impious to suppose.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxxi-p7">So, it is most true that every rational soul, if, as it should, it earnestly devotes itself through love to longing for supreme blessedness, shall at some time receive that blessedness to enjoy, that what it now sees as <i>through a glass</i> and <i>in a riddle</i>, it may then see <i>face to face</i>. But it is most foolish to doubt whether it enjoys that blessedness eternally; since, 
<pb n="137" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_137.html" id="iv.lxxi-Page_137"/>in the enjoyment of that blessedness, it will be impossible to turn the soul
aside by any fear, or to deceive it by false security; nor, having once experienced the need of that blessedness, will it be able not to love it; nor will that blessedness desert the soul that loves it; nor shall there be anything powerful enough to separate them against their will. Hence, the soul that has once begun to enjoy supreme Blessedness will be eternally blessed.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.lxxii-p3">FROM this it may be inferred, as a certain consequence, that the soul which despises the love of the supreme good will incur eternal misery. It might be said that it would be justly punished for such contempt if it <i>lost</i> existence or life, since it does not employ itself to the end for which it was created. But reason in no wise admits such a belief, namely, that after such great guilt it is condemned to be what it was before all its guilt.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxxii-p4">For, before it existed, it could neither be guilty nor feel a penalty. If, then, the soul despising that end for which it was created, dies so as to feel nothing, or so as to be nothing at all, its condition will be the same when in the greatest guilt and when without all guilt; and the supremely wise Justice will not distinguish between what is capable of no good and wills no evil, and what is capable of the greatest good and wills the greatest evil.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxxii-p5">But it is plain enough that this is a contradiction. Therefore, nothing can be more logical, and nothing ought to be believed more confidently than that the

<p class="PFirst" id="iv.lxxviii-p3">HENCE, with however great confidence so important a truth is believed, the faith will be useless and, as it were, dead, unless it is strong and living through love. For, that the faith which is accompanied by sufficient love is by no means idle, if an opportunity of operation offers, but rather exercises itself in an abundance of works, as it could not do without love, may be proved from this fact alone, that, since it loves the supreme Justice, it can scorn nothing
that is just, it can approve nothing that is unjust. Therefore, seeing that the fact of its operation shows that life, without which it could not operate, is inherent in it; it is not absurd to say that operative faith is alive, because it has the life of love without which it could not operate; and that idle faith is not living, because it lacks that life of love, with which it would not be idle.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxxviii-p4">Hence, if not only he who has lost his sight is called blind, but also he who ought to have sight and has it not, why cannot, in like manner, <i>faith without love</i> be called <i>dead</i>; not because it has lost its life, that is, love; but because it has not the life which it ought always to have? As that faith, then, which operates through love is recognised as living, so that which is idle, through contempt, is proved to be dead. It may, therefore, be said
with sufficient fitness that living faith believes <i>in</i> that <i>in</i> which we ought to believe; while dead faith merely believes that which ought to be believed.</p>

For, although I can speak of a Trinity because of Father and Son and the Spirit of both, who are three; yet I cannot, in one word, show why they are three; as if I should call this Being a Trinity because of its three persons, just as I would call it a
unity because of its one substance.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxxix-p4">For three persons are not to be supposed, because all persons which are more than one so subsist separately from one another, that there must be as many substances as there are persons, a fact that is recognised in the case of more men than one, when there are as many persons as there are individual substances. Hence, in the supreme Being, just as there are not more substances than one, so there are not more persons than one.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxxix-p5">So, if one wishes to express to any why they are three, he will say that they are Father and Son and the Spirit of both, unless perchance, compelled by the lack of a precisely appropriate term, he shall choose some one of those terms which cannot be applied in a plural sense to the supreme Being, in order to indicate what cannot be expressed in any fitting language; as if he should say, for instance, that this wonderful Trinity is one essence or nature, and three
persons or substances.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="iv.lxxix-p6">For these two terms are more appropriately chosen to describe plurality in the supreme Being, because the word <i>person</i> is applied only to an individual, rational nature; and the word substance is ordinarily applied to individual beings, which especially subsist in plurality. For individual beings are especially exposed to, that is, are <i>subject</i> to, accidents, and for this reason they more properly receive the name <i>sub-stance</i>. Now, it is already
manifest that the supreme Being, which is subject to no accidents, cannot properly be called a substance, except as the word <i>substance</i> is used in the same sense with the word <i>Essence</i>.

imminent necessity.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="v.i-p5">1. IF one doubts or denies the existence of a being of such a nature that nothing greater than it can be conceived, he receives this answer:</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p6">The existence of this being is proved, in the first place, by the fact that he himself, in his doubt or denial regarding this being, already has it in his understanding; for in hearing it spoken of he understands what is spoken of. It is proved, therefore, by the fact that what he understands must exist not only in his understanding, but in reality also.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p7">And the proof of this is as follows.&#8212;It is a greater thing to exist both in the understanding and in reality than to be in the understanding alone. And if this being is in the understanding alone, whatever has even in the past existed in reality will be greater than this being. And so that which was greater than all beings will be less than some being, and will not be greater than all: which is a manifest contradiction.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p8">And hence, that which is greater than all, already proved to be in the understanding, must exist not only in the understanding, but also in reality: for otherwise it will not be greater than all other beings.</p>

<pb n="146" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_146.html" id="v.i-Page_146"/> 

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p9">2. The fool might make this reply:</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p10">This being is said to be in my understanding already, only because I understand what is said. Now could it not with equal justice be said that I have in my understanding all manner of unreal objects, having absolutely no existence in themselves, because I understand these things if one speaks of them, whatever they may be?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p11">Unless indeed it is shown that this being is of such a character that it cannot be held in concept like all unreal objects, or objects whose existence is uncertain: and hence I am not able to conceive of it when I hear of it, or to hold it in concept; but I must understand it and have it in my understanding; because, it seems, I cannot conceive of it in any other way than by understanding it, that is, by comprehending in my knowledge its existence in reality.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p12">But if this is the case, in the first place there will be no distinction between what has precedence in time&#8212;namely, the having of an object in the understanding&#8212;and what is subsequent in time&#8212;namely, the understanding that an object exists; as in the example of the picture, which exists first in the mind of the painter, and afterwards in his work.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p13">Moreover, the following assertion can hardly be accepted: that this being, when it is spoken of and heard of, cannot be conceived not to exist in the way in which even God can be conceived not to exist. For if this is impossible, what was the object of this argument against one who doubts or denies the existence of such a being?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p14">Finally, that this being so exists that it cannot be perceived by an understanding convinced of its own indubitable existence, unless this being is afterwards 
<pb n="147" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_147.html" id="v.i-Page_147"/>conceived of&#8212;this should be proved to me by an indisputable argument, but not by that which you have advanced: namely, that what I understand, when I hear it, already is in my understanding. For thus in my understanding, as I still think, could be all sorts of things whose existence is uncertain,
or which do not exist at all, if some one whose words I should understand mentioned them. And so much the more if I should be deceived, as often happens, and believe in them: though I do not yet believe in the being whose existence you would prove.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p15">3. Hence, your example of the painter who already has in his understanding what he is to paint cannot agree with this argument. For the picture, before it is made, is contained in the artificer&#8217;s art itself; and any such thing, existing in the art of an artificer, is nothing but a part of his understanding itself. A joiner, <name id="v.i-p15.1">St. Augustine</name> says, when he is about to make a box in fact, first has it in his art. The box which is made in fact is not life; but
the box which exists in his art is life. For the artificer&#8217;s soul lives, in which all these things are, before they are produced. Why, then, are these things life in the living soul of the artificer, unless because they are nothing else than the knowledge or understanding of the soul itself?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p16">With the exception, however, of those facts which are known to pertain to the mental nature, whatever, on being heard and thought out by the understanding, is perceived to be real, undoubtedly that real object is one thing, and the understanding itself, by which the object is grasped, is another. Hence, even if it were true that there is a being than which a greater is inconceivable: yet to this being, when 
<pb n="148" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_148.html" id="v.i-Page_148"/>heard of and understood, the not yet created picture
in the mind of the painter is not analogous.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p17">4. Let us notice also the point touched on above, with regard to this being which is greater than all which can be conceived, and which, it is said, can be none other than God himself. I, so far as actual knowledge of the object, either from its specific or general character, is concerned, am as little able to conceive of this being when I hear of it, or to have it in my understanding, as I am to conceive of or understand God himself: whom, indeed, for this very
reason I can conceive not to exist. For I do not know that reality itself which God is, nor can I form a conjecture of that reality from some other like reality. For you yourself assert that that reality is such that there can be nothing else like it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p18">For, suppose that I should hear something said of a man absolutely unknown to me, of whose very existence I was unaware. Through that special or general knowledge by which I know what man is, or what men are, I could conceive of him also, according to the reality itself, which man is. And yet it would be possible, if the person who told me of him deceived me, that the man himself, of whom I conceived, did not exist ; since that reality according to which I conceived
of him, though a no less indisputable fact, was not that man, but any man.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p19">Hence, I am not able, in the way in which I should have this unreal being in concept or in understanding, to have that being of which you speak in concept or in understanding, when I hear the word <i>God</i> or the words, <i>a being greater than all other beings</i>. For I can conceive of the man according to a fact that is real and familiar to me: but of God, or a being greater 
<pb n="149" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_149.html" id="v.i-Page_149"/>than all others, I could not conceive at all, except merely according to the word.
And an object can hardly or never be conceived according to the word alone.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p20">For when it is so conceived, it is not so much the word itself (which is, indeed, a real thing&#8212;that is, the sound of the letters and syllables) as the signification of the word, when heard, that is conceived. But it is not conceived as by one who knows what is generally signified by the word; by whom, that is, it is conceived according to a reality and in true conception alone. It is conceived as by a man who does not know the object, and conceives of it only
in accordance with the movement of his mind produced by hearing the word, the mind attempting to image for itself the signification of the word that is heard. And it would be surprising if in the reality of fact it could ever attain to this.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p21">Thus, it appears, and in no other way, this being is also in my understanding, when I hear and understand a person who says that there is a being greater than all conceivable beings. So much for the assertion that this supreme nature already is in my understanding.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p22">5. But that this being must exist, not only in the understanding but also in reality, is thus proved to me:</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p23">If it did not so exist, whatever exists in reality would be greater than it. And so the being which has been already proved to exist in my understanding, will not be greater than all other beings.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p24">I still answer: if it should be said that a being which cannot be even conceived in terms of any fact, is in the understanding, I do not deny that this being is, accordingly, in my understanding. But since 
<pb n="150" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_150.html" id="v.i-Page_150"/>through this fact it can in no wise attain to real existence also, I do not yet concede to it that existence at all, until some certain proof of it shall be given.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p25">For he who says that this being exists, because otherwise the being which is greater than all will not be greater than all, does not attend strictly enough to what he is saying. For I do not yet say, no, I even deny or doubt that this being is greater than any real object. Nor do I concede to it any other existence than this (if it should be called existence) which it has when the mind, according to a word merely heard, tries to form the image of an object
absolutely unknown to it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p26">How, then, is the veritable existence of that being proved to me from the assumption, by hypothesis, that it is greater than all other beings? For I should still deny this, or doubt your demonstration of it, to this extent, that I should not admit that this being is in my understanding and concept even in the way in which many objects whose real existence is uncertain and doubtful, are in my understanding and concept. For it should be proved first that this being
itself really exists somewhere; and then, from the fact that it is greater than all, we shall not hesitate to infer that it also subsists in itself.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p27">6. For example: it is said that somewhere in the ocean is an island, which, because of the difficulty, or rather the impossibility, of discovering what does not exist, is called the lost island. And they say that this island has an inestimable wealth of all manner of riches and delicacies in greater abundance than is told of the Islands of the Blest; and that having no owner or inhabitant, it is more excellent than all other countries
<pb n="151" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_151.html" id="v.i-Page_151"/>, which are inhabited by
mankind, in the abundance with which it is stored.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p28">Now if some one should tell me that there is such an island, I should easily understand his words, in which there is no difficulty. But suppose that he went on to say, as if by a logical inference: &#8220;You can no longer doubt that this island which is more excellent than all lands exists somewhere, since you have no doubt that it is in your understanding. And since it is more excellent not to be in the understanding alone, but to exist both in the understanding and in
reality, for this reason it must exist. For if it does not exist, any land which really exists will be more excellent than it; and so the island already understood by you to be more excellent will not be more excellent.&#8221;</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p29">If a man should try to prove to me by such reasoning that this island truly exists, and that its existence should no longer be doubted, either I should believe that he was jesting, or I know not which I ought to regard as the greater fool: myself, supposing that I should allow this proof; or him, if he should suppose that he had established with any certainty the existence of this island. For he ought to show first that the hypothetical excellence of this island
exists as a real and indubitable fact, and in no wise as any unreal object, or one whose existence is uncertain, in my understanding.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p30">7. This, in the mean time, is the answer the fool could make to the arguments urged against him. When he is assured in the first place that this being is so great that its non-existence is not even conceivable, and that this in turn is proved on no other ground than the fact that otherwise it will not be greater than 
<pb n="152" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_152.html" id="v.i-Page_152"/>all things, the fool may make the same answer, and say:</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p31">When did I say that any such being exists in reality, that is, a being greater than all others?&#8212;that on this ground it should be proved to me that it also exists in reality to such a degree that it cannot even be conceived not to exist? Whereas in the first place it should be in some way proved that a nature which is higher, that is, greater and better, than all other natures, exists; in order that from this we may then be able to prove all attributes which
necessarily the being that is greater and better than all possesses.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p32">Moreover, it is said that the non-existence of this being is inconceivable. It might better be said, perhaps, that its non-existence, or the possibility of its non-existence, is unintelligible. For according to the true meaning of the word, unreal objects are unintelligible. Yet their existence is conceivable in the way in which the fool conceived of the non-existence of God. I am most certainly aware of my own existence; but I know, nevertheless, that my
non-existence is possible. As to that supreme being, moreover, which God is, I understand without any doubt both his existence, and the impossibility of his non-existence. Whether, however, so long as I am most positively aware of my existence, I can conceive of my non-existence, I am not sure. But if I can, why can I not conceive of the non-existence of whatever else I know with the same certainty? If, however, I cannot, God will not be the only being of which it can be said, it is
impossible to conceive of his non-existence.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.i-p33">8. The other parts of this book are argued with such truth, such brilliancy, such grandeur; and are so replete with usefulness, so fragrant with a certain 
<pb n="153" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_153.html" id="v.i-Page_153"/>perfume of devout and holy feeling, that though there are matters in the beginning which, however rightly sensed, are weakly presented, the rest of the work should not be rejected on this account. The rather ought these earlier matters to be reasoned more cogently, and the whole to be received with great

<p class="SectionInfo" id="v.ii.i-p1">A general refutation of Gaunilon&#8217;s argument. It is shown that a being than which a greater cannot be conceived exists in reality.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="v.ii.i-p2">YOU say&#8212;whosoever you may be, who say that a fool is capable of making these statements&#8212;that a being than which a greater cannot be conceived is not in the understanding in any other sense than that in which a being that is altogether inconceivable in terms of reality, is in the understanding. You say that the inference that this being exists in reality, from the fact that it is in the understanding, is no more just than the inference that a lost island
most certainly exists, from the fact that when it is described the hearer does not doubt that it is in his understanding.</p>

<pb n="154" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_154.html" id="v.ii.i-Page_154"/> 

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.i-p3">But I say: if a being than which a greater is inconceivable is not understood or conceived, and is not in the understanding or in concept, certainly either God is not a being than which a greater is inconceivable, or else he is not understood or conceived, and is not in the understanding or in concept. But I call on your faith and conscience to attest that this is most false. Hence, that than which a greater cannot be conceived is truly understood and conceived,
and is in the understanding and in concept. Therefore either the grounds on which you try to controvert me are not true, or else the inference which you think to base logically on those grounds is not justified.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.i-p4">But you hold, moreover, that supposing that a being than which a greater cannot be conceived is understood, it does not follow that this being is in the understanding; nor, if it is in the understanding, does it therefore exist in reality.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.i-p5">In answer to this, I maintain positively: if that being can be even conceived to be, it must exist in reality. For that than which a greater is inconceivable cannot be conceived except as without beginning. But whatever can be conceived to exist, and does not exist, can be conceived to exist through a beginning. Hence what can be conceived to exist, but does not exist, is not the being than which a greater cannot be conceived. Therefore, if such a being can be
conceived to exist, necessarily it does exist.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.i-p6">Furthermore: if it can be conceived at all, it must exist. For no one who denies or doubts the existence of a being than which a greater is inconceivable, denies or doubts that if it did exist, its non-existence, either in reality or in the understanding, would be impossible. For otherwise it would not be a being 
<pb n="155" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_155.html" id="v.ii.i-Page_155"/>than which a greater cannot be conceived. But as to whatever can be conceived, but does not exist&#8212;if there were such a being, its
non-existence, either in reality or in the understanding, would be possible. Therefore if a being than which a greater is inconceivable can be even conceived, it cannot be nonexistent.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.i-p7">But let us suppose that it does not exist, even if it can be conceived. Whatever can be conceived, but does not exist, if it existed, would not be a being than which a greater is inconceivable. If, then, there were a being a greater than which is inconceivable, it would not be a being than which a greater is inconceivable: which is most absurd. Hence, it is false to deny that a being than which a greater cannot be conceived exists, if it can be even conceived;
much the more, therefore, if it can be understood or can be in the understanding.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.i-p8">Moreover, I will venture to make this assertion: without doubt, whatever at any place or at any time does not exist&#8212;even if it does exist at some place or at some time&#8212;can be conceived to exist nowhere and never, as at some place and at some time it does not exist. For what did not exist yesterday, and exists to-day, as it is understood not to have existed yesterday, so it can be apprehended by the intelligence that it never exists. And what is not
here, and is elsewhere, can be conceived to be nowhere, just as it is not here. So with regard to an object of which the individual parts do not exist at the same places or times: all its parts and therefore its very whole can be conceived to exist nowhere or never.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.i-p9">For, although time is said to exist always, and the world everywhere, yet time does not as a whole exist 
<pb n="156" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_156.html" id="v.ii.i-Page_156"/>always, nor the world as a whole everywhere. And as individual parts of time do not exist when others exist, so they can be conceived never to exist. And so it can be apprehended by the intelligence that individual parts of the world exist nowhere, as they do not exist where other parts exist. Moreover, what is composed of parts can be dissolved in
concept, and be non-existent. Therefore, whatever at any place or at any time does not exist as a whole, even if it is existent, can be conceived not to exist.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.i-p10">But that than which a greater cannot be conceived, if it exists, cannot be conceived not to exist. Otherwise, it is not a being than which a greater cannot be conceived: which is inconsistent. By no means, then, does it at any place or at any time fail to exist as a whole: but it exists as a whole everywhere and always.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.i-p11">Do you believe that this being can in some way be conceived or understood, or that the being with regard to which these things are understood can be in concept or in the understanding? For if it cannot, these things cannot be understood with reference to it. But if you say that it is not understood and that it is not in the understanding, because it is not thoroughly understood; you should say that a man who cannot face the direct rays of the sun does not see the
light of day, which is none other than the sunlight. Assuredly a being than which a greater cannot be conceived exists, and is in the understanding, at least to this extent&#8212;that these statements regarding it are understood.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="v.ii.ii-p2">The argument is continued. It is shown that a being than which a greater is inconceivable can be conceived, and also, in so far, exists.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="v.ii.ii-p3">I HAVE said, then, in the argument which you dispute, that when the fool hears mentioned a being than which a greater is inconceivable, he understands what he hears. Certainly a man who does not understand when a familiar language is spoken, has no understanding at all, or a very dull one. Moreover, I have said that if this being is understood, it is in the understanding. Is that in no understanding which has been proved necessarily to exist in the reality of
fact?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.ii-p4">But you will say that although it is in the understanding, it does not follow that it is understood. But observe that the fact of its being understood does necessitate its being in the understanding. For as what is conceived, is conceived by conception, and what is conceived by conception, as it is conceived, so is in conception; so what is understood, is understood by understanding, and what is understood by understanding, as it is understood, so is in the
understanding. What can be more clear than this?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.ii-p5">After this, I have said that if it is even in the understanding alone, it can be conceived also to exist in reality, which is greater. If, then, it is in the understanding alone, obviously the very being than which greater cannot be conceived is one than which a greater can be conceived. What is more logical? For if it exists even in the understanding alone, can it not be conceived also to exist in reality? And if it can be so conceived, does not he who conceives
of this conceive of a thing greater than that being, if it exists 
<pb n="158" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_158.html" id="v.ii.ii-Page_158"/>in the understanding alone? What more consistent inference, then, can be made than this: that if a being than which a greater cannot be conceived is in the understanding alone, it is not that than which a greater cannot be conceived?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.ii-p6">But, assuredly, in no understanding is a being than which a greater is conceivable a being than which a greater is inconceivable. Does it not follow, then, that if a being than which a greater cannot be conceived is in any understanding, it does not exist in the understanding alone? For if it is in the understanding alone, it is a being than which a greater can be conceived, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="v.ii.iii-p2">A criticism of Gaunilon&#8217;s example, in which he tries to show that in this way the real existence of a lost island might be inferred from the fact of its being conceived.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="v.ii.iii-p3">BUT, you say, it is as if one should suppose an island in the ocean, which surpasses all lands in its fertility, and which, because of the difficulty, or the impossibility, of discovering what does not exist, is called a lost island; and should say that there can no doubt that this island truly exists in reality, for this reason, that one who hears it described easily understands what he hears.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.iii-p4">Now I promise confidently that if any man shall devise anything existing either in reality or in concept alone (except that than which a greater be conceived) to which he can adapt the sequence of my reasoning, I will discover that thing, and will give him his lost island, not to be lost again.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.iii-p5">But it now appears that this being than which a greater is inconceivable cannot be conceived not to 
<pb n="159" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_159.html" id="v.ii.iii-Page_159"/>be, because it exists on so assured a ground of truth; for otherwise it would not exist at all.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.iii-p6">Hence, if any one says that he conceives this being not to exist, I say that at the time when he conceives of this either he conceives of a being than which a greater is inconceivable, or he does not conceive at all. If he does not conceive, he does not conceive of the non-existence of that of which he does not conceive. But if he does conceive, he certainly conceives of a being which cannot be even conceived not to exist. For if it could be conceived not to
exist, it could be conceived to have a beginning and an end. But this is impossible.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.iii-p7">He, then, who conceives of this being conceives of a being which cannot be even conceived not to exist; but he who conceives of this being does not conceive that it does not exist; else he conceives what is inconceivable.

<p class="PFirst" id="v.ii.iv-p3">YOU say, moreover, that whereas I assert that this supreme being cannot be <i>conceived</i> not to exist, it might better be said that its non-existence, or even the possibility of its non-existence, cannot be <i>understood</i>.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.iv-p4">But it was more proper to say, it cannot be conceived. For if I had said that the object itself cannot be understood not to exist, possibly you yourself, who say that in accordance with the true meaning of the term what is unreal cannot be understood, would offer the objection that nothing which is can be understood
<pb n="160" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_160.html" id="v.ii.iv-Page_160"/> not to be, for the non-existence of what exists is unreal: hence God would not be the only being of which it could be said, it is impossible to
understand its non-existence. For thus one of those beings which most certainly exist can be understood not to exist in the same way in which certain other real objects can be understood not to exist.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.iv-p5">But this objection, assuredly, cannot be urged against the term <i>conception</i>, if one considers the matter well. For although no objects which exist can be understood not to exist, yet all objects, except that which exists in the highest degree, can be conceived not to exist. For all those objects, and those alone, can be conceived not to exist, which have a beginning or end or composition of parts: also, as I have already said, whatever at any place or at any
time does not exist as a whole.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.iv-p6">That being alone, on the other hand, cannot be conceived not to exist, in which any conception discovers neither beginning nor end nor composition of parts, and which any conception finds always and everywhere as a whole.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.iv-p7">Be assured, then, that you can conceive of your own non-existence, although you are most certain that you exist. I am surprised that you should have admitted that you are ignorant of this. For we conceive of the non-existence of many objects which we know to exist, and of the existence of many which we know not to exist; not by forming the opinion that they so exist, but by imagining that they exist as we conceive of them.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.iv-p8">And indeed, we can conceive of the non-existence of an object, although we know it to exist, because at the same time we can conceive of the former and 
<pb n="161" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_161.html" id="v.ii.iv-Page_161"/>know the latter. And we cannot conceive of the nonexistence of an object, so long as we know it to exist, because we cannot conceive at the same time of existence and non-existence.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.iv-p9">If, then, one will thus distinguish these two senses of this statement, he will understand that nothing, so long as it is known to exist, can be conceived not to exist; and that whatever exists, except that being than which a greater cannot be conceived, can be conceived not to exist, even when it is known to exist.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.iv-p10">So, then, of God alone it can be said that it is impossible to conceive of his non-existence; and yet many objects, so long as they exist, in one sense cannot be conceived not to exist.

<p class="SectionInfo" id="v.ii.v-p2">A particular discussion of certain statements of Gaunilon&#8217;s. In the first place, he misquoted the argument which he undertook to refute.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="v.ii.v-p3">THE nature of the other objections which you, in behalf of the fool, urge against me it is easy, even for a man of small wisdom, to detect; and I had therefore thought it unnecessary to show this. But since I hear that some readers of these objections think they have some weight against me, I will discuss them briefly.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.v-p4">In the first place, you often repeat that I assert that what is greater than all other beings is in the understanding; and if it is in the understanding, it exists also in reality, for otherwise the being which is greater than all would not be greater than all.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.v-p5">Nowhere in all my writings is such a demonstration found. For the real existence of a being which 
<pb n="162" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_162.html" id="v.ii.v-Page_162"/>is said to be <i>greater than all other beings</i> cannot be demonstrated in the same way with the real existence of one that is said to be <i>a being than which a greater cannot be conceived</i>.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.v-p6">If it should be said that a being than which a greater cannot be conceived has no real existence, or that it is possible that it does not exist, or even that it can be conceived not to exist, such an assertion can be easily refuted. For the non-existence of what does not exist is possible, and that whose non-existence is possible can be conceived not to exist. But whatever can be conceived not to exist, if it exists, is not a being than which a greater cannot
be conceived; but if it does not exist, it would not, even if it existed, be a being than which a greater cannot be conceived. But it cannot be said that a being than which a greater is inconceivable, if it exists, is not a being than which a greater is inconceivable; or that if it existed, it would not be a being than which a greater is inconceivable.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.v-p7">It is evident, then, that neither is it non-existent, nor is it possible that it does not exist, nor can it be conceived not to exist. For otherwise, if it exists, it is not that which it is said to be in the hypothesis; and if it existed, it would not be what it is said to be in the hypothesis.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.v-p8">But this, it appears, cannot be so easily proved of a being which is said to be <i>greater than all other beings</i>. For it is not so evident that what can be conceived not to exist is not greater than all existing beings, as it is evident that it is not a being than which a greater cannot be conceived. Nor is it so indubitable that if a being greater than all other beings exists, it is no other than the being than which a greater cannot be conceived; or that if
it were such a being, 
<pb n="163" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_163.html" id="v.ii.v-Page_163"/>some other might not be this being in like manner; as it is certain with regard to a being which is hypothetically posited as one than which a greater cannot be conceived.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.v-p9">For consider: if one should say that there is a being greater than all other beings, and that this being can nevertheless be conceived not to exist; and that a being greater than this, although it does not exist, can be conceived to exist: can it be so clearly inferred in this case that this being is therefore not a being greater than all other existing beings, as it would be most positively affirmed in the other case, that the being under discussion is not,
therefore, a being than which a greater cannot be conceived?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.v-p10">For the former conclusion requires another premise than the predication,<i> greater than all other beings</i>. In my argument, on the other hand, there is no need of any other than this very predication, <i>a being than which a greater cannot be conceived</i>.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.v-p11">If the same proof cannot be applied when the being in question is predicated to be greater than all others, which can be applied when it is predicated to be a being than which a greater cannot be conceived, you have unjustly censured me for saying what I did not say; since such a predication differs so greatly from that which I actually made. If, on the other hand, the other argument is valid, you ought not to blame me so for having said what can be proved.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="v.ii.vi-p2">A discussion of Gaunilon&#8217;s argument in his second chapter: that any unreal beings can be understood in the same way, and would, to that extent, exist.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="v.ii.vi-p3">ANOTHER of your objections is that any unreal beings, or beings whose existence is uncertain, can be understood and be in the understanding in the same way with that being which I discussed. I am surprised that you should have conceived this objection, for I was attempting to prove what was still uncertain, and contented myself at first with showing that this being is understood in any way, and is in the understanding. It was my intention to consider, on these
grounds, whether this being is in the understanding alone, like an unreal object, or whether it also exists in fact, as a real being. For if unreal objects, or objects whose existence is uncertain, in this way are understood and are in the understanding, because, when they are spoken of, the hearer understands what the speaker means, there is no reason why that being of which I spoke should not be understood and be in the understanding.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.vi-p4">How, moreover, can these two statements of yours 
<pb n="165" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_165.html" id="v.ii.vi-Page_165"/>be reconciled: (1) the assertion that if a man should speak of any unreal objects, whatever they might be, you would understand, and (2) the assertion that on hearing of that being which does exist, and not in that way in which even unreal objects are held in concept, you would not say that you conceive of it or have it in concept; since, as you say, you cannot conceive of it in any other way than by
understanding it, that is, by comprehending in your knowledge its real existence?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.vi-p5">How, I ask, can these two things be reconciled: that unreal objects are understood, and that understanding an object is comprehending in knowledge its real existence? The contradiction does not concern me: do you see to it. But if unreal objects are also in some sort understood, and your definition is applicable, not to every understanding, but to a certain sort of understanding, I ought not to be blamed for saying that a being than which a greater cannot be
conceived is understood and is in the understanding, even before I reached the certain conclusion that this being exists in reality.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="v.ii.vii-p3">AGAIN, you say that it can probably never be believed that this being, when it is spoken of and heard of, cannot be conceived not to exist in the same way in which even God may be conceived not to exist.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.vii-p4">Such an objection could be answered by those who have attained but little skill in disputation and argument. For is it compatible with reason for a man to

Or, if at some times its existence is denied, because only to a certain extent is it understood, and that which is not at all understood is the same to him: is not what
is still undetermined more easily proved of a being which exists in some understanding than of one which exists is no understanding?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.vii-p5">Hence it cannot be credible that any man denies the existence of a being than which a greater cannot be conceived, which, when he hears of it, he understands in a certain degree: it is incredible, I say, that any man denies the existence of this being because he denies the existence of God, the sensory perception of whom he in no wise conceives of.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.vii-p6">Or if the existence of another object, because it is not at all understood, is denied, yet is not the existence of what is understood in some degree more easily proved than the existence of an object which is in no wise understood?</p>

<pb n="167" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_167.html" id="v.ii.viii-Page_167"/>not analogous to the not yet executed picture in the understanding of the painter, is quite unnecessary. It was not for this purpose that I suggested the preconceived picture. I had no thought of asserting that the being which I was discussing is of such a nature; but I wished to show that what is not understood to exist can be in the understanding.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.viii-p4">Again, you say that when you hear of a being than which a greater is inconceivable, you cannot conceive of it in terms of any real object known to you either specifically or generally, nor have it in your understanding. For, you say, you neither know such a being in itself, nor can you form an idea of it from anything like it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.viii-p5">But obviously this is not true. For everything that is less good, in so far as it is good, is like the greater good. It is therefore evident to any rational mind, that by ascending from the lesser good to the greater, we can form a considerable notion of a being than which a greater is inconceivable.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.viii-p6">For instance, who (even if he does not believe that what he conceives of exists in reality) supposing that there is some good which has a beginning and an end, does not conceive that a good is much better, which, if it begins, does not cease to be? And that as the second good is better than the first, so that good which has neither beginning nor end, though it is ever passing from the past through the present to the future, is better than the second? And that far
better than this is a being&#8212;whether any being of such a nature exists or not&#8212;which in no wise requires change or motion, nor is compelled to undergo change or motion?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.viii-p7">Is this inconceivable, or is some being greater

There is, then, a means of forming a notion of a being than which a greater is inconceivable.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.viii-p8">So easily, then, can the fool who does not accept sacred authority be refuted, if he denies that a notion may be formed from other objects of a being than which a greater is inconceivable.

<p class="SectionInfo" id="v.ii.ix-p2">The possibility of understanding and conceiving of the supremely great being. The argument advanced against the fool is confirmed.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="v.ii.ix-p3">BUT even if it were true that a being than which a greater is inconceivable cannot be conceived or understood; yet it would not be untrue that a being than which a greater cannot be conceived is conceivable and intelligible. There is nothing to prevent one&#8217;s saying <i>ineffable</i>, although what is said to be ineffable cannot be spoken of. <i>Inconceivable</i> is conceivable, although that to which the word <i>inconceivable</i> can be applied is not conceivable. So,
when one says, <i>that than which nothing greater is conceivable</i>, undoubtedly what is heard is conceivable and intelligible, although that being itself, than which a greater is inconceivable, cannot be conceived or understood.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.ix-p4">Or, though there is a man so foolish as to say that there is no being than which a greater is inconceivable, he will not be so shameless as to say that he 
<pb n="169" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_169.html" id="v.ii.ix-Page_169"/>cannot understand or conceive of what he says. Or, if such a man is found, not only ought his words to be rejected, but he himself should be contemned.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.ix-p5">Whoever, then, denies the existence of a being than which a greater cannot be conceived, at least understands and conceives of the denial which he makes. But this denial he cannot understand or conceive of without its component terms; and a term of this statement is <i>a being than which a greater cannot be conceived</i>. Whoever, then, makes this denial, understands and conceives of that than which a greater is inconceivable.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.ix-p6">Moreover, it is evident that in the same way it is possible to conceive of and understand a being whose non-existence is impossible; but he who conceives of this conceives of a greater being than one whose nonexistence is possible. Hence, when a being than which a greater is inconceivable is conceived, if it is a being whose non-existence is possible that is conceived, it is not a being than which a greater cannot be conceived. But an object cannot be at once
conceived and not conceived. Hence he who conceives of a being than which a greater is inconceivable, does not conceive of that whose non-existence is possible, but of that whose non-existence is impossible. Therefore, what he conceives of must exist; for anything whose non-existence is possible, is not that of which he conceives.</p>

For so great force does the signification of this reasoning contain in itself, that this being which is the subject of discussion, is of necessity, from the very fact that it is
understood or conceived, proved also to exist in reality, and to be whatever we should believe of the divine substance.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="v.ii.x-p4">For we attribute to the divine substance anything of which it can be conceived that it is better to be than not to be that thing. For example: it is better to be eternal than not eternal; good, than not good; nay, goodness itself, than not goodness itself. But it cannot be that anything of this nature is not a property of the being than which a greater is inconceivable.

I have therefore been obliged to finish it as best I could, more hurriedly, and so more briefly, than I wished. For had an undisturbed and adequate period been allowed me for publishing it, I should have introduced and subjoined many things about which I have been silent. For it was while suffering under great anguish of heart, the
origin and reason of which are known to God, that, at the entreaty of others, I began the book in England, and finished it when an exile in Capra. From the theme on which it was published I have called it <i>Cur Deus Homo</i>, and have divided it into two short books. The first contains the objections of infidels, who despise the Christian faith because they deem it contrary to reason; and also the reply of believers; and, in fine, leaving Christ out of view (as if nothing had ever been known
of him), it proves, by absolute reasons, the impossibility that any man should be saved without him. Again, in the second book, likewise, as if nothing were known of Christ, it is moreover shown by plain reasoning and fact that human nature was ordained for this purpose, viz., that every man should enjoy a happy immortality, both in body and in soul; and 
<pb n="178" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_178.html" id="vi.i-Page_178"/>that it was necessary that this design for which man was made should be fulfilled; but that it could not be fulfilled unless God became
man, and unless all things were to take place which we hold with regard to Christ. I request all who may wish to copy this book to prefix this brief preface, with the heads of the whole work, at its commencement; so that, into whosesoever hands it may fall, as he looks on the face of it, there may be nothing in the whole body of the work which shall escape his notice.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="vi.ii.i-p1">The question on which the whole work rests.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="vi.ii.i-p2">I HAVE been often and most earnestly requested by many, both personally and by letter, that I would hand down in writing the proofs of a certain doctrine of our faith, which I am accustomed to give to inquirers; for they say that these proofs gratify them, and are considered sufficient. This they ask, not for the sake of attaining to faith by means of reason, but that they may be gladdened by understanding and meditating on those things which they believe; and that,
as far as possible, they may be always ready to convince any one who demands of them a reason of that hope which is in us. And this question, both infidels are accustomed to bring up against us, ridiculing Christian simplicity as absurd; and many believers ponder it in their hearts; for what cause or necessity, in sooth, God became man, and by his own death, as we believe and affirm, restored life to the world; when 
<pb n="179" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_179.html" id="vi.ii.i-Page_179"/>he might have done this, by means of some other being, angelic or human,
or merely by his will. Not only the learned, but also many unlearned persons interest themselves in this inquiry and seek for its solution. Therefore, since many desire to consider this subject, and, though it seem very difficult in the investigation, it is yet plain to all in the solution, and attractive for the value and beauty of the reasoning; although what ought to be sufficient has been said by the holy fathers and their successors, yet I will take pains to disclose to inquirers what God
has seen fit to lay open to me. And since investigations, which are carried on by question and answer, are thus made more plain to many, and especially to less quick minds, and on that account are more gratifying, I will take to argue with me one of those persons who agitate this subject; one, who among the rest impels me more earnestly to it, so that in this way Boso may question and Anselm reply.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="vi.ii.ii-p2">How those things which are to be said should be received.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.ii-p3"><i>Boso.</i> As the right order requires us to believe the deep things of Christian faith before we undertake to discuss them by reason; so to my mind it appears a neglect if, after we are established in the faith, we do not seek to understand what we believe. Therefore, since I thus consider myself to hold the faith of our redemption, by the prevenient grace of God, so that, even were I unable in any way to understand what I believe, still nothing could shake my
constancy; I desire that you should discover to me, what, as you know, many besides myself ask, for what necessity 
<pb n="180" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_180.html" id="vi.ii.ii-Page_180"/>and cause God, who is omnipotent, should have assumed the littleness and weakness of human nature for the sake of its renewal?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.ii-p4"><i>Anselm.</i> You ask of me a thing which is above me, and therefore I tremble to take in hand subjects too lofty for me, lest, when some one may have thought or even seen that I do not satisfy him, he will rather believe that I am in error with regard to the substance of the truth, than that my intellect is not able to grasp it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.ii-p5"><i>Boso.</i> You ought not so much to fear this, because you should call to mind, on the other hand, that it often happens in the discussion of some question that God opens what before lay concealed; and that you should hope for the grace of God, because if you liberally impart those things which you have freely received, you will be worthy to receive higher things to which you have not yet attained.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.ii-p6"><i>Anselm.</i> There is also another thing on account of which I think this subject can hardly, or not at all, be discussed between us comprehensively; since, for this purpose, there is required a knowledge of Power and Necessity and Will and certain other subjects which are so related to one another that none of them can be fully examined without the rest; and so the discussion of these topics requires a separate labor, which, though not very easy, in my opinion,
is by no means useless; for ignorance of these subjects makes certain things difficult, which by acquaintance with them become easy.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.ii-p7"><i>Boso.</i> You can speak so briefly with regard to these things, each in its place, that we may both have all that is requisite for the present object, and what remains to be said we can put off to another time.</p>

<pb n="181" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_181.html" id="vi.ii.ii-Page_181"/> 

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.ii-p8"><i>Anselm.</i> This also much disinclines me from your request, not only that the subject is important, but as it is of a form fair above the sons of men, so is it of a wisdom fair above the intellect of men. On this account, I fear, lest, as I am wont to be incensed against sorry artists, when I see our Lord himself painted in an unseemly figure; so also it may fall out with me if I should undertake to exhibit so rich a theme in rough and vulgar diction.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.ii-p9"><i>Boso.</i> Even this ought not to deter you, because, as you allow any one to talk better if he can, so you preclude none from writing more elegantly if your language does not please him. But, to cut you off from all excuses, you are not to fulfil this request of mine for the learned but for me, and those asking the same thing with me.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.ii-p10"><i>Anselm.</i> Since I observe your earnestness and that of those who desire this thing with you, out of love and pious zeal, I will try to the best of my ability with the assistance of God and your prayers, which, when making this request, you have often promised me, not so much to make plain what you inquire about, as to inquire with you. But I wish all that I say to be received with this understanding, that, if I shall have said anything which higher authority
does not corroborate, though I appear to demonstrate it by argument, yet it is not to be received with any further confidence, than as so appearing to me for the time, until God in some way make a clearer revelation to me. But if I am in any measure able to set your inquiry at rest, it should be concluded that a wiser than I will be able to do this more fully; nay, we must understand that for all that a man can say or 
<pb n="182" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_182.html" id="vi.ii.ii-Page_182"/>know still deeper grounds of so great a truth lie concealed.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.ii-p11"><i>Boso.</i> Suffer me, therefore, to make use of the words of infidels; for it is proper for us when we seek to investigate the reasonableness of our faith to propose the objections of those who are wholly unwilling to submit to the same faith, without the support of reason. For although they appeal to reason because they do not believe, but we, on the other hand, because we do believe; nevertheless, the thing sought is one and the same. And if you bring up
anything in reply which sacred authority seems to oppose, let it be mine to urge this inconsistency until you disprove it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.iii-p3"><i>Boso.</i> Infidels ridiculing our simplicity charge upon us that we do injustice and dishonor to God when we affirm that he descended into the womb of a virgin, that he was born of woman, that he grew on the nourishment of milk and the food of men; and, passing over many other things which seem incompatible with Deity, that he endured fatigue, hunger, thirst, stripes and crucifixion among thieves.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.iii-p4"><i>Anselm.</i> We do no injustice or dishonor to God, but give him thanks with all the heart, praising and proclaiming the ineffable height of his compassion. For the more astonishing a thing it is and beyond expectation, that he has restored us from so great and deserved ills in which we were, to so great and unmerited blessings which we had forfeited; by so much 
<pb n="183" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_183.html" id="vi.ii.iii-Page_183"/>the more has he shown his more exceeding love and tenderness towards us. For did they but
carefully consider how fitly in this way human redemption is secured, they would not ridicule our simplicity, but would rather join with us in praising the wise beneficence of God. For, as death came upon the human race by the disobedience of man, it was fitting that by man&#8217;s obedience life should be restored. And, as sin, the cause of our condemnation, had its origin from a woman, so ought the author of our righteousness and salvation to be born of a woman. And so also was it proper that the
devil, who, being man&#8217;s tempter, had conquered him in eating of the tree, should be vanquished by man in the suffering of the tree which man bore. Many other things also, if we carefully examine them, give a certain indescribable beauty to our redemption as thus procured.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="vi.ii.iv-p2">How these things appear not decisive to infidels, and merely like so many pictures.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.iv-p3"><i>Boso.</i> These things must be admitted to be beautiful, and like so many pictures; but, if they have no solid foundation, they do not appear sufficient to infidels, as reasons why we ought to believe that God wished to suffer the things which we speak of. For when one wishes to make a picture, he selects something substantial to paint it upon, so that his picture may remain. For no one paints in water or in air, because no traces of the picture remain in them.
Wherefore, when we hold up to infidels these harmonious proportions which you speak of as so many pictures of the real thing, since they do not think this 
<pb n="184" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_184.html" id="vi.ii.iv-Page_184"/>belief of ours a reality, but only a fiction, they consider us, as it were, to be painting upon a cloud. Therefore the rational existence of the truth first be shown, I mean, the necessity, which proves that God ought to or could have condescended to those things which we affirm. Afterwards, to make the body of the truth, so to speak,
shine forth more clearly, these harmonious proportions, like pictures of the body, must be described.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.iv-p4"><i>Anselm.</i> Does not the reason why God ought to do the things we speak of seem absolute enough when we consider that the human race, that work of his so very precious, was wholly ruined, and that it was not seemly that the purpose which God had made concerning man should fall to the ground; and, moreover, that this purpose could not be carried into effect unless the human race were delivered by their Creator himself?</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="vi.ii.vi-p2">How infidels find fault with us for saying that God has redeemed us by his death, and thus has shown his love towards us, and that he came to overcome the devil for us.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="vi.ii.vi-p3"><i>Boso.</i> This they greatly wonder at, because we call this redemption a release. For, say they, in what custody or imprisonment, or under whose power were you held, that God could not free you from it, without purchasing your redemption by so many sufferings, and finally by his own blood? And when we tell them that he freed us from our sins, and from his own wrath, and from hell, and from the power of the devil, whom he came to vanquish for us, because we were
unable to do it, and that he purchased for us the kingdom of heaven; and that, by doing all these things, he manifested the greatness of his love towards us; they answer: If you say that God, who, as you believe, created the universe by a word, could not do all these things by a simple command, you contradict yourselves, for you make him powerless. Or, if you grant that he could have done these things in some other way, but did not wish to, how can you vindicate his wisdom, when you assert that
he desired, without any reason, to suffer things so unbecoming? For these things which you bring up are all regulated by his will; for the wrath of God is nothing but his desire to punish. If, then, he does not desire to punish 
<pb n="186" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_186.html" id="vi.ii.vi-Page_186"/>the sins of men, man is free from his sins, and from the wrath of God, and from hell, and from the power of the devil, all which things are the sufferings of sin; and, what he had lost by reason of these sins, he now regains. For, in whose power is hell, or the
devil? Or, whose is the kingdom of heaven, if it be not his who created all things? Whatever things, therefore, you dread or hope for, all lie subject to his will, whom nothing can oppose. If, then, God were unwilling to save the human race in any other way than that you mention, when he could have done it by his simple will, observe, to say the least, how you disparage his wisdom. For, if a man without motive should do, by severe toil, a thing which he could have done in some easy way, no one
would consider him a wise man. As to your statement that God has shown in this way how much he loved you, there is no argument to support this, unless it be proved that he could not otherwise have saved man. For, if he could not have done it otherwise, then it was, indeed, necessary for him to manifest his love in this way. But now, when he could have saved man differently, why is it that, for the sake of displaying his love, he does and suffers the things which you enumerate? For does he not
show good angels how much he loves them, though he suffer no such things as these for them? As to what you say of his coming to vanquish the devil for you, with what meaning dare you allege this? Is not the omnipotence of God everywhere enthroned? How is it, then, that God must needs come down from heaven to vanquish the devil? These are the objections with which infidels think they can withstand us.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="vi.ii.vii-p2">How the devil had no justice on his side against man; and why it was, that he seemed to have had it, and why God could have freed man in this way.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="vi.ii.vii-p3">MOREOVER, I do not see the force of that argument, which we are wont to make use of, that God, in order to save men, was bound, as it were, to try a contest with the devil in justice, before he did in strength, so that, when the devil should put to death that being in whom there was nothing worthy of death, and who was God, he should justly lose his power over sinners; and that, if it were not so, God would have used undue force against the devil, since the devil had
a rightful ownership of man, for the devil had not seized man with violence, but man had freely surrendered to him. It is true that this might well enough be said, if the devil or man belonged to any other being than God, or were in the power of any but God. But since neither the devil nor man belong to any but God, and neither can exist without the exertion of Divine power, what cause ought God to try with his own creature (<span lang="la" id="vi.ii.vii-p3.1"><span lang="la" id="vi.ii.vii-p3.2"><i>de suo, in
suo</i></span></span>), or what should he do but punish his servant, who had seduced his fellow-servant to desert their common Lord and come over to himself; who, a traitor, had taken to himself a fugitive; a thief, had taken to himself a fellow-thief, with what he had stolen from his Lord. For when one was stolen from his Lord by the persuasions of the other, both were thieves. For what could be more just than for God to do this? Or, should God, the judge of all, snatch man, thus
held, out of the power of him who holds him so unrighteously, either for the 
<pb n="188" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_188.html" id="vi.ii.vii-Page_188"/>purpose of punishing him in some other way than by means of the devil, or of sparing him, what injustice would there be in this? For, though man deserved to be tormented by the devil, yet the devil tormented him unjustly. For man merited punishment, and there was no more suitable way for him to be punished than by that being to whom he had given his consent to sin. But the infliction of punishment was nothing
meritorious in the devil; on the other hand, he was even more unrighteous in this, because he was not led to it by a love of justice, but urged on by a malicious impulse. For he did not do this at the command of God, but God&#8217;s inconceivable wisdom, which happily controls even wickedness, permitted it. And, in my opinion, those who think that the devil has any right in holding man, are brought to this belief by seeing that man is justly exposed to the tormenting of the devil, and that God in
justice permits this; and therefore they suppose that the devil rightly inflicts it. For the very same thing, from opposite points of view, is sometimes both just and unjust, and hence, by those who do not carefully inspect the matter, is deemed wholly just or wholly unjust. Suppose, for example, that one strikes an innocent person unjustly, and hence justly deserves to be beaten himself; if, however, the one who was beaten, though he ought not to avenge himself, yet does strike the person who beat
him, then he does it unjustly. And hence this violence on the part of the man who returns the blow is unjust, because he ought not to avenge himself; but as far as he who received the blow is concerned, it is just, for since he gave a blow unjustly, he justly deserves to receive one in return. Therefore, from opposite views, the same action is 

<pb n="189" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_189.html" id="vi.ii.vii-Page_189"/>
both just and unjust, for it may chance that one person shall consider it only just, and another only unjust. So also the devil is said to torment
men justly, because God in justice permits this, and man in justice suffers it. But when man is said to suffer justly, it is not meant that his just suffering is inflicted by the hand of justice itself, but that he is punished by the just judgment of God. But if that written decree is brought up, which the Apostle says was made against us, and cancelled by the death of Christ; and if any one thinks that it was intended by this decree that the devil, as if under the writing of a sort of compact,
should justly demand sin and the punishment of sin, of man, before Christ suffered, as a debt for the first sin to which he tempted man, so that in this way he seems to prove his right over man, I do not by any means think that it is to be so understood. For that writing is not of the devil, because it is called the writing of a decree of the devil, but of God. For by the just judgment of God it was decreed, and, as it were, confirmed by writing, that, since man had sinned, he should not
henceforth of himself have the power to avoid sin or the punishment of sin; for the spirit is out-going and not returning (<span lang="la" id="vi.ii.vii-p3.3"><span lang="la" id="vi.ii.vii-p3.4"><i>est enim spiritus vadens et non rediens</i></span></span>); and he who sins ought not to escape with impunity, unless pity spare the sinner, and deliver and restore him. Wherefore we ought not to believe that, on account of this writing, there can be found any justice on the part of the devil in his tormenting man. In fine,
as there is never any injustice in a good angel, so in an evil angel there can be no justice at all. There was no reason, therefore, as respects the devil, why God should not make use of his own power against him for the liberation of man.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="vi.ii.viii-p2">How, although the acts of Christ&#8217;s condescension which we speak of do not belong to his divinity, it yet seems improper to infidels that these things should be said of him even as a man; and why it appears to them that this man did not suffer death of his own will.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.viii-p3"><i>Anselm.</i> The will of God ought to be a sufficient reason for us, when he does anything, though we cannot see why he does it. For the will of God is never irrational.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.viii-p4"><i>Boso.</i> That is very true, if it be granted that God does wish the thing in question; but many will never allow that God does wish anything if it be inconsistent with reason.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.viii-p5"><i>Anselm.</i> What do you find inconsistent with reason, in our confessing that God desired those things which make up our belief with regard to his incarnation?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.viii-p6"><i>Boso.</i> This in brief: that the Most High should stoop to things so lowly, that the Almighty should do a thing with such toil.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.viii-p7"><i>Anselm.</i> They who speak thus do not understand our belief. For we affirm that the Divine nature is beyond doubt impassible, and that God cannot at all be brought down from his exaltation, nor <i>toil</i> in anything which he wishes to effect. But we say that the Lord Jesus Christ is very God and very man, one person in two natures, and two natures in one person. When, therefore, we speak of God as enduring any humiliation or infirmity, we do not refer to the
majesty of that nature, which cannot suffer; but to the feebleness of the human constitution which he assumed. 
<pb n="191" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_191.html" id="vi.ii.viii-Page_191"/>And so there remains no ground of objection against our faith. For in this way we intend no debasement of the Divine nature, but we teach that one person is both Divine and human. In the incarnation of God there is no lowering of the Deity; but the nature of man we believe to be exalted.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.viii-p8"><i>Boso.</i> Be it so; let nothing be referred to the Divine nature, which is spoken of Christ after the manner of human weakness; but how will it ever be made out a just or reasonable thing that God should treat or suffer to be treated in such a manner, that man whom the Father called his beloved Son in whom he was well pleased, and whom the Son made himself? For what justice is there in <i>his</i> suffering death for the sinner, who was the most just of all men?
What man, if he condemned the innocent to free the guilty, would not himself be judged worthy of condemnation? And so the matter seems to return to the same incongruity which is mentioned above. For if he could not save sinners in any other way than by condemning the just, where is his omnipotence? If, however, he could, but did not wish to, how shall we sustain his wisdom and justice?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.viii-p9"><i>Anselm.</i> God the Father did not treat that man as you seem to suppose, nor put to death the innocent for the guilty. For the Father did not compel him to suffer death, or even allow him to be slain, against his will, but of his own accord he endured death for the salvation of men.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.viii-p10"><i>Boso.</i> Though it were not against his will, since he agreed to the will of the Father; yet the Father seems to have bound him, as it were, by his injunction. For it is said that Christ &#8220;humbled himself, being made obedient to the Father even unto death,
<pb n="192" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_192.html" id="vi.ii.viii-Page_192"/> and that the death of the cross. For which cause God also hath highly exalted him;&#8221; and that &#8220;he learned obedience from the things which he suffered;&#8221; and that God spared not his own Son, but gave him up
for us all.&#8221; And likewise the Son says: &#8220;I came not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.&#8221; And when about to suffer, he says; &#8220;As the Father hath given me commandment, so I do.&#8221; Again: &#8220;The cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? &#8221; And, at another time : &#8220;Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.&#8221; And again: &#8220;Father, if this cup may not pass from me except I drink it, thy will be done.&#8221; In all these
passages it would rather appear that Christ endured death by the constraint of obedience, than by the inclination of his own free will.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.ix-p13"><i>Anselm.</i> Ought man to suffer death, if he had never sinned, or should God demand this of him?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.ix-p14"><i>Boso.</i> It is on this account that we believe that man would not have been subject to death, and that God would not have exacted this of him; but I should like to hear the reason of the thing from you.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.ix-p15"><i>Anselm.</i> You acknowledge that the intelligent creature was made holy, and for this purpose, viz., to be happy in the enjoyment of God.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.ix-p16"><i>Boso.</i> Yes.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.ix-p17"><i>Anselm.</i> You surely will not think it proper for God to make his creature miserable without fault, when he had created him holy that he might enjoy a state of blessedness. For it would be a miserable thing for man to die against his will.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.ix-p18"><i>Boso.</i> It is plain that, if man had not sinned, God ought not to compel him to die.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.ix-p19"><i>Anselm.</i> God did not, therefore, compel Christ to die; but he suffered death of his own will, not yielding
<pb n="194" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_194.html" id="vi.ii.ix-Page_194"/> up his life as an act of obedience, but on account of his obedience in maintaining holiness; for he held out so firmly in this obedience that he met death on account of it. It may, indeed be said, that the Father commanded him to die, when he enjoined that upon him on account of which he met death. It was in this sense, then, that &#8220;as the Father
gave him the commandment, so he did, and the cup which He gave to him, he drank; and he was made obedient to the Father, even unto death;&#8221; and thus &#8220;he learned obedience from the things which he suffered,&#8221; that is, how far obedience should be maintained. Now the word &#8220;didicit,&#8221; which is used, can be understood in two ways. For either &#8220;didicit&#8221; is written for this: he caused others to learn; or it is used, because he did learn by experience what he had an understanding of before. Again, when the
Apostle had said: &#8220;he humbled himself, being made obedient even unto death, and that the death of the cross,&#8221; he added: &#8220;wherefore God also hath exalted him and given him a name, which is above every name.&#8221; And this is similar to what David said: &#8220;he drank of the brook in the way, therefore did he lift up the head.&#8221; For it is not meant that he could not have attained his exaltation in any other way but by obedience unto death; nor is it meant that his exaltation was conferred on him, only as a
reward of his obedience (for he himself said before he suffered, that all things had been committed to him by the Father, and that all things belonging to the Father were his); but the expression is used because he had agreed with the Father and the Holy Spirit, that there was no other way to reveal to the world the height of his omnipotence, than by his death. For if a thing do not take place, 
<pb n="195" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_195.html" id="vi.ii.ix-Page_195"/>except on condition of something else, it is not improperly said to occur by reason of that
thing. For if we intend to do a thing, but mean to do something else first by means of which it may be done; when the first thing which we wish to do is done, if the result is such as we intended, it is properly said to be on account of the other; since that is now done which caused the delay; for it had been determined that the first thing should not be done without the other. If, for instance, I propose to cross a river only in a boat, though I can cross it in a boat or on horseback, and
suppose that I delay crossing because the boat is gone; but if afterwards I cross, when the boat has returned, it may be properly said of me: the boat was ready, and therefore he crossed. And we not only use this form of expression, when it is by means of a thing which we desire should take place first, but also when we intend to do something else, not by means of that thing, but only after it. For if one delays taking food because he has not to-day attended the celebration of mass; when that
has been done which he wished to do first, it is not improper to say to him: now take food, for you have now done that for which you delayed taking food. Far less, therefore, is the language strange, when Christ is said to be exalted on this account, because he endured death; for it was through this, and after this, that he determined to accomplish his exaltation. This may be understood also in the same way as that passage in which it is said that our Lord increased in wisdom, and in favor with
God; not that this was really the case, but that he deported himself as if it were so. For he was exalted after his death, as if it were really on account of that. Moreover, that saying of his: &#8220;I 
<pb n="196" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_196.html" id="vi.ii.ix-Page_196"/>came not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me,&#8221; is precisely like that other saying: &#8220;My doctrine is not mine;&#8221; for what one does not have of himself, but of God, he ought not to call his own, but God&#8217;s. Now no one has the truth which he teaches, or a holy will, of himself, but
of God. Christ, therefore, came not to do his own will, but that of the Father; for his holy will was not derived from his humanity, but from his divinity. For that sentence: &#8220;God spared not his own Son, but gave him up for us all,&#8221; means nothing more than that he did not rescue him. For there are found in the Bible many things like this. Again, when he says: &#8220;Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt;&#8221; and &#8220;If this cup may not pass from
me, except I drink it, thy will be done;&#8221; he signifies by his own will the natural desire of safety, in accordance with which human nature shrank from the anguish of death. But he speaks of the will of the Father, not because the Father preferred the death of the Son to his life; but because the Father was not willing to rescue the human race, unless man were to do even as great a thing as was signified in the death of Christ. Since reason did not demand of another what he could not do,
therefore, the Son says that he desires his own death. For he preferred to suffer, rather than that the human race should be lost; as if he were to say to the Father: &#8220;Since thou dost not desire the reconciliation of the world to take place in any other way, in this respect, I see that thou desirest my death; let thy will, therefore, be done, that is, let my death take place, so that the world may be reconciled to thee.&#8221; For we often say that one desires a thing, because he does not 
<pb n="197" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_197.html" id="vi.ii.ix-Page_197"/>choose
something else, the choice of which would preclude the existence of that which he is said to desire; for instance, when we say that he who does not choose to close the window through which the draft is admitted which puts out the light, wishes the light to be extinguished. So the Father desired the death of the Son, because he was not willing that the world should be saved in any other way, except by man&#8217;s doing so great a thing as that which I have mentioned. And this, since none other could
accomplish it, availed as much with the Son, who so earnestly desired the salvation of man, as if the Father had commanded him to die; and, therefore, &#8220;as the Father gave him commandment, so he did, and the cup which the Father gave to him he drank, being obedient even unto death.&#8221;</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="vi.ii.x-p2">Likewise on the same topics; and how otherwise they can be correctly explained.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="vi.ii.x-p3">IT is also a fair interpretation that it was by that same holy will by which the Son wished to die for the salvation of the world, that the Father gave him commandment (yet not by compulsion), and the cup of suffering, and spared him not, but gave him up for us and desired his death; and that the Son himself was obedient even unto death, and learned obedience from the things which he suffered. For as with regard to that will which led him to a holy life, he did not
have it as a human being of himself, but of the Father; so also that will by which he desired to die for the accomplishment of so great good, he could not have had but from the Father of lights, from 
<pb n="198" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_198.html" id="vi.ii.x-Page_198"/>whom is every good and perfect gift. And as the Father is said to draw by imparting an inclination, so there is nothing improper in asserting that he moves man. For as the Son says of the Father: &#8220;No man cometh to me except the Father draw him,&#8221; he might as well have said, except he move him.
In like manner, also, could he have declared: &#8220;No man layeth down his life for my sake, except the Father move or draw him.&#8221; For since a man is drawn or moved by his will to that which he invariably chooses, it is not improper to say that God draws or moves him when he gives him this will. And in this drawing or impelling it is not to be understood that there is any constraint, but a free and grateful clinging to the holy will which has been given. If then it cannot be denied that the Father
drew or moved the Son to death by giving him that will; who does not see that, in the same manner, he gave him commandment to endure death of his own accord and to take the cup, which he freely drank. And if it is right to say that the Son spared not himself, but gave himself for us of his own will, who will deny that it is right to say that the Father, of whom he had this will, did not spare him but gave him up for us, and desired his death? In this way, also, by following the will received
from the Father invariably, and of his own accord, the Son became obedient to Him, even unto death; and learned obedience from the things which he suffered; that is, be learned how great was the work to be accomplished by obedience. For this is real and sincere obedience when a rational being, not of compulsion, but freely, follows the will received from God. In other ways, also, we can properly explain the Father&#8217;s desire that the Son should die, though these would appear sufficient.
<pb n="199" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_199.html" id="vi.ii.x-Page_199"/>
For as we say that he desires a thing who causes another to desire it; so, also, we say that he desires a thing who approves of the desire of another, though he does not cause that desire. Thus when we see a man who desires to endure pain with fortitude for the accomplishment of some good design; though we acknowledge that we wish to have him endure that pain, yet we do not choose, nor take pleasure in, his suffering, but in his choice. We are, also, accustomed to say that he who can prevent a
thing but does not, desires the thing which he does not prevent. Since, therefore, the will of the Son pleased the Father, and he did not prevent him from choosing, or from fulfilling his choice, it is proper to say that he wished the Son to endure death so piously and for so great an object, though he was not pleased with his suffering. Moreover, he said that the cup must not pass from him, except he drank it, not because he could not have escaped death had he chosen to; but because, as has
been said, the world could not otherwise be saved; and it was his fixed choice to suffer death, rather than that the world should not be saved. It was for<i> this</i> reason, also, that he used those words, viz., to teach the human race that there was no other salvation for them but by his death; and not to show that he had no power at all to avoid death. For whatsoever things are said of him, similar to these which have been mentioned, they are all to be explained in accordance with the belief
that he died, not by compulsion, but of free choice. For he was omnipotent, and it is said of him, when he was offered up, that he desired it. And he says himself: &#8220;I lay down my life that I may take it again; no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself; I have power 
<pb n="200" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_200.html" id="vi.ii.x-Page_200"/>to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.&#8221; A man cannot, therefore, be properly said to have been driven to a thing which he does of his own power and will.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.x-p4"><i>Boso.</i> But this simple fact, that God allows him to be so treated, even if he were willing, does not seem becoming for such a Father in respect to such a Son.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.x-p5"><i>Anselm.</i> Yes, it is of all things most proper that such a Father should acquiesce with such a Son in his desire, if it be praiseworthy as relates to the honor of God, and useful for man&#8217;s salvation, which would not otherwise be effected.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.x-p6"><i>Boso.</i> The question which still troubles us is, how the death of the Son can be proved reasonable and necessary. For otherwise, it does not seem that the Son ought to desire it, or the Father compel or permit it. For the question is, why God could not save man in some other way, and if so, why he wished to do it in this way? For it both seems unbecoming for God to have saved man in this way; and it is not clear how the death of the Son avails for the
salvation of man. For it is a strange thing if God so delights in, or requires, the blood of the innocent, that he neither chooses, nor is able, to spare the guilty without the sacrifice of the innocent.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.x-p7"><i>Anselm.</i> Since, in this inquiry, you take the place of those who are unwilling to believe anything not previously proved by reason, I wish to have it understood between us that we do not admit anything in the least unbecoming to be ascribed to the Deity, and that we do not reject the <i>smallest</i> reason if it be not opposed by a greater. For as it is impossible to attribute anything in the least unbecoming to God; so 
<pb n="201" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_201.html" id="vi.ii.x-Page_201"/>any reason, however small, if not
overbalanced by a greater, has the force of necessity.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.x-p10"><i>Boso.</i> It is so.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.x-p11"><i>Anselm.</i> Let us suppose, then, that the incarnation of God, and the things that we affirm of him as man, had never taken place; and be it agreed between us that man was made for happiness, which cannot be attained in this life, and that no being can ever arrive at happiness, save by freedom from sin, and that no man passes this life without sin. Let us take for granted, also, the other things, the belief of which is necessary for eternal salvation.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xi-p3"><i>Anselm.</i> We must needs inquire, therefore, in what manner God puts away men&#8217;s sins; and, in order to do this more plainly, let us first consider what it is to sin, and what it is to make satisfaction for sin.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xi-p4"><i>Boso.</i> It is yours to explain and mine to listen.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xi-p5"><i>Anselm.</i> If man or angel always rendered to God his due, he would never sin.</p>

<pb n="202" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_202.html" id="vi.ii.xi-Page_202"/> 

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xi-p6"><i>Boso.</i> I cannot deny that.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xi-p7"><i>Anselm.</i> Therefore to sin is nothing else than not to render to God his due.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xi-p8"><i>Boso.</i> What is the debt which we owe to God?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xi-p9"><i>Anselm.</i> Every wish of a rational creature should be subject to the will of God.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xi-p10"><i>Boso.</i> Nothing is more true.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xi-p11"><i>Anselm.</i> This is the debt which man and angel owe to God, and no one who pays this debt commits sin; but every one who does not pay it sins. This is justice, or uprightness of will, which makes a being just or upright in heart, that is, in will; and this is the sole and complete debt of honor which we owe to God, and which God requires of us. For it is such a will only, when it can be exercised, that does works pleasing to God; and when this will cannot be
exercised, it is pleasing of itself alone, since without it no work is acceptable. He who does not render this honor which is due to God, robs God of his own and dishonors him; and this is sin. Moreover, so long as he does not restore what he has taken away, he remains in fault; and it will not suffice merely to restore what has been taken away, but, considering the contempt offered, he ought to restore more than he took away. For as one who imperils another&#8217;s safety does not enough by merely
restoring his safety, without making some compensation for the anguish incurred; so he who violates another&#8217;s honor does not enough by merely rendering honor again, but must, according to the extent of the injury done, make restoration in some way satisfactory to the person whom he has dishonored. We must also observe that when any one pays what he has unjustly taken away, he ought to give something which could not have been 
<pb n="203" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_203.html" id="vi.ii.xi-Page_203"/>demanded of him, had he not stolen what belonged to another. So
then, every one who sins ought to pay back the honor of which he has robbed God; and this is the satisfaction which every sinner owes to God.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xii-p4"><i>Boso.</i> I do not see why it is not proper.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xii-p5"><i>Anselm.</i> To remit sin in this manner is nothing else than not to punish; and since it is not right to cancel sin without compensation or punishment; if it be not punished, then is it passed by undischarged.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xii-p6"><i>Boso.</i> What you say is reasonable.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xii-p7"><i>Anselm.</i> It is not fitting for God to pass over anything in his kingdom undischarged.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xii-p8"><i>Boso.</i> If I wish to oppose this, I fear to sin.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xii-p9"><i>Anselm.</i> It is, therefore, not proper for God thus to pass over sin unpunished.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xii-p10"><i>Boso.</i> Thus it follows.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xii-p11"><i>Anselm.</i> There is also another thing which follows if sin be passed by unpunished, viz., that with God there will be no difference between the guilty and the not guilty; and this is unbecoming to God.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xii-p13"><i>Anselm.</i> Observe this also. Every one knows that justice to man is regulated by law, so that, according to the requirements of law, the measure of award is bestowed by God.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xii-p14"><i>Boso.</i> This is our belief.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xii-p15"><i>Anselm.</i> But if sin is neither paid for nor punished, it is subject to no law.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xii-p16"><i>Boso.</i> I cannot conceive it to be otherwise.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xii-p17"><i>Anselm.</i> Injustice, therefore, if it is cancelled by compassion alone, is more free than justice, which seems very inconsistent. And to these is also added a further incongruity, viz., that it makes injustice like God. For as God is subject to no law, so neither is injustice.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xii-p18"><i>Boso.</i> I cannot withstand your reasoning. But when God commands us in every case to forgive those who trespass against us, it seems inconsistent to enjoin a thing upon us which it is not proper for him to do himself.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xii-p19"><i>Anselm.</i> There is no inconsistency in God&#8217;s commanding us not to take upon ourselves what belongs to Him alone. For to execute vengeance belongs to none but Him who is Lord of all; for when the powers of the world rightly accomplish this end, God himself does it who appointed them for the purpose.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xii-p20"><i>Boso.</i> You have obviated the difficulty which I thought to exist; but there is another to which I would like to have your answer. For since God is so free as to be subject to no law, and to the judgment of no one, and is so merciful as that nothing more merciful can be conceived; and nothing is right or fit save as he wills; it seems a strange thing for us to say that he is wholly unwilling or unable to put away an injury done to himself, when we are wont to
apply 
<pb n="205" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_205.html" id="vi.ii.xii-Page_205"/>to him for indulgence with regard to those offences which we commit against others.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xii-p21"><i>Anselm.</i> What you say of God&#8217;s liberty and choice and compassion is true; but we ought so to interpret these things as that they may not seem to interfere with His dignity. For there is no liberty except as regards what is best or fitting; nor should that be called mercy which does anything improper for the Divine character. Moreover, when it is said that what God wishes is just, and that what He does not wish is unjust, we must not understand that if God
wished anything improper it would be just, simply because he wished it. For if God wishes to lie, we must not conclude that it is right to lie, but rather that he is not God. For no will can ever wish to lie, unless truth in it is impaired, nay, unless the will itself be impaired by forsaking truth. When, then, it is said: &#8220;If God wishes to lie,&#8221; the meaning is simply this: &#8220;If the nature of God is such as that he wishes to lie;&#8221; and, therefore, it does not follow that falsehood is right,
except it be understood in the same manner as when we speak of two impossible things: &#8220;If this be true, then that follows; because neither <i>this</i> nor <i>that</i> is true;&#8221; as if a man should say: &#8220;Supposing water to be dry, and fire to be moist;&#8221; for neither is the case. Therefore, with regard to these things, to speak the whole truth: If God desires a thing, it is right that he should desire that which involves no unfitness. For if God chooses that it should rain, it is right that it
should rain; and if he desires that any man should die, then is it right that he should die. Wherefore, if it be not fitting for God to do anything unjustly, or out of course, it does not belong to his liberty or compassion or will to let the sinner go unpunished

<p class="SectionInfo" id="vi.ii.xiv-p2">How the honor of God exists in the punishment of the wicked.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xiv-p3"><i>Boso.</i> But I wish to hear from you whether the punishment of the sinner is an honor to God, or how it is an honor. For if the punishment of the sinner is not for God&#8217;s honor when the sinner does not pay what he took away, but is punished, God loses his honor so that he cannot recover it. And this seems in contradiction to the things which have been said.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xiv-p4"><i>Anselm.</i> It is impossible for God to lose his honor; for either the sinner pays his debt of his own accord, or, if he refuse, God takes it from him. For either man renders due submission to God of his own will, by avoiding sin or making payment, or else God subjects him to himself by torments, even against man&#8217;s will, and thus shows that he is the Lord of man, though man refuses to acknowledge it of his own accord. And here we must observe that as man in
sinning takes away what belongs to God, so God in punishing gets in return what pertains to man. For not 
<pb n="208" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_208.html" id="vi.ii.xiv-Page_208"/>only does that belong to a man which he has in present possession, but also that which it is in his power to have. Therefore, since man was so made as to be able to attain happiness by avoiding sin; if, on account of his sin, he is deprived of happiness and every good, he repays from his own inheritance what he has stolen, though he repay it against his will. For although God does not
apply what he takes away to any object of his own, as man transfers the money which he has taken from another to his own use; yet what he takes away serves the purpose of his own honor, for this very reason, that it is taken away. For by this act he shows that the sinner and all that pertains to him are under his subjection.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xv-p3"><i>Boso.</i> What you say satisfies me. But there is still another point which I should like to have you answer. For if, as you make out, God ought to sustain his own honor, why does he allow it to be violated even in the least degree? For what is in any way made liable to injury is not entirely and perfectly preserved.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xv-p4"><i>Anselm.</i> Nothing can be added to or taken from the honor of God. For this honor which belongs to him is in no way subject to injury or change. But as the individual creature preserves, naturally or by reason, the condition belonging, and, as it were, allotted to him, he is said to obey and honor God; and to this, rational nature, which possesses intelligence, is especially bound. And when the being chooses what he ought, he honors God; not by bestowing
<pb n="209" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_209.html" id="vi.ii.xv-Page_209"/>
anything upon him, but because he brings himself freely under God&#8217;s will and disposal, and maintains his own condition in the universe, and the beauty of the universe itself, as far as in him lies. But when he does not choose what he ought, he dishonors God, as far as the being himself is concerned, because he does not submit himself freely to God&#8217;s disposal. And he disturbs the order and beauty of the universe, as relates to himself, although he cannot injure nor tarnish the power and majesty
of God. For if those things which are held together in the circuit of the heavens desire to be elsewhere than under the heavens, or to be further removed from the heavens, there is no place where they can be but under the heavens, nor can they fly from the heavens without also approaching them. For both whence and whither and in what way they go, they are still under the heavens; and if they are at a greater distance from one part of them, they are only so much nearer to the opposite part. And
so, though man or evil angel refuse to submit to the Divine will and appointment, yet he cannot escape it; for if he wishes to fly from a will that commands, he falls into the power of a will that punishes. And if you ask whither he goes, it is only under the permission of that will; and even this wayward choice or action of his becomes subservient, under infinite wisdom, to the order and beauty of the universe before spoken of. For when it is understood that God brings good out of many forms
of evil, then the satisfaction for sin freely given, or if this be not given, the exaction of punishment, hold their own place and orderly beauty in the same universe. For if Divine wisdom were not to insist upon things, when wickedness tries to disturb the 
<pb n="210" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_210.html" id="vi.ii.xv-Page_210"/>right appointment, there would be, in the very universe which God ought to control, an unseemliness springing from the violation of the beauty of arrangement, and God would appear to be deficient in his management. And these two things
are not only unfitting, but consequently impossible; so that satisfaction or punishment must needs follow every sin.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xvii-p4"><i>Anselm.</i> When you shall see the difficulty of our restoration, you will understand the impossibility of theirs. But other angels cannot be substituted for them on this account (to pass over its apparent inconsistency with the completeness of the first creation), because they ought to be such as the former angels

which, in respect to the others who were substituted for them after their fall, was impossible. For two beings who stand firm in truth are not equally deserving of praise, if one has never seen the punishment of sin, and the other forever witnesses its eternal reward. For it must not for a moment be supposed that good angels are upheld by the fall of evil angels, but by their own virtue. For, as they would have been condemned together, had the good sinned with the bad, so, had the unholy stood
firm with the holy, they would have been likewise upheld. For, if, without the fall of a part, the rest could not be upheld, it would follow, either that none could ever be upheld, or else that it was necessary for some one to fall, in order by his punishment to uphold the rest; but either of these suppositions is absurd. Therefore, had all stood, all would have been upheld in the same manner as those who stood; and this manner I explained, as well as I could, when treating of the reason why
God did not bestow perseverance upon the devil.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="vi.ii.xviii-p2">Whether there will be more holy men than evil angels.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p3"><i>Anselm.</i> If the angels, before any of them fell, existed in that perfect number of which we have spoken, 
<pb n="213" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_213.html" id="vi.ii.xviii-Page_213"/>then men were only made to supply the place of the lost angels; and it is plain that their number will not be greater. But if that number were not found in all the angels together, then both the loss and the original deficiency must be made up from men, and more men will be chosen than there were fallen angels. And so we shall say that men were made
not only to restore the diminished number, but also to complete the imperfect number.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p4"><i>Boso.</i> Which is the better theory, that angels were originally made perfect in number or that they were not?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p5"><i>Anselm.</i> I will state my views.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p6"><i>Boso.</i> I cannot ask more of you.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p7"><i>Anselm.</i> If man was created after the fall of evil angels, as some understand the account in Genesis, I do not think that I can prove from this either of these suppositions positively. For it is possible, I think, that the angels should have been created perfect in number, and that afterwards man was created to complete their number when it had been lessened; and it is also possible that they were not perfect in number, because God deferred completing the
number, as he does even now, determining in his own time to create man. Wherefore, either God would only complete that which was not yet perfect, or, if it were also diminished, He would restore it. But if the whole creation took place at once, and those days in which Moses appears to describe a successive creation are not to be understood like such days as ours, I cannot see how angels could have been created perfect in number. Since, if it were so, it seems to me that some, either men or
angels, would fall immediately, else in heaven&#8217;s empire there would be more than the 
<pb n="214" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_214.html" id="vi.ii.xviii-Page_214"/>complete number required. If, therefore, all things were created at one and the same time, it should seem that angels, and the first two human beings, formed an incomplete number, so that, if no angel fell, the deficiency alone should be made up, but if any fell, the lost part should be restored; and that human nature, which had stood firm, though weaker than that of angels, might, as it were, justify God,
and put the devil to silence, if he were to attribute his fall to weakness. And in case human nature fell, much more would it justify God against the devil, and even against itself, because, though made far weaker and of a mortal race, yet, in the elect, it would rise from its weakness to an estate exalted above that from which the devil was fallen, as far as good angels, to whom it should be equal, were advanced after the overthrow of the evil, because they persevered. From these reasons, I am
rather inclined to the belief that there was not, originally, that complete number of angels necessary to perfect the celestial state; since, supposing that man and angels were not created at the same time, this is possible; and it would follow of necessity, if they were created at the same time, which is the opinion of the majority, because we read: &#8220;He, who liveth forever, created all things at once.&#8221; But if the perfection of the created universe is to be understood as consisting, not so much
in the number of beings, as in the number of natures; it follows that human nature was either made to consummate this perfection, or that it was superfluous, which we should not dare affirm of the nature of the smallest reptile. Wherefore, then, it was made for itself, and not merely to restore the number of beings possessing another nature. From which it is plain that, even had no 
<pb n="215" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_215.html" id="vi.ii.xviii-Page_215"/>angel fallen, men would yet have had their place in the celestial kingdom. And hence it follows that there
was not a perfect number of angels, even before a part fell; otherwise, of necessity some men or angels must fall, because it would be impossible that any should continue beyond the perfect number.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p8"><i>Boso.</i> You have not labored in vain.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p9"><i>Anselm.</i> There is, also, as I think, another reason which supports, in no small degree, the opinion that angels were not created perfect in number.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p10"><i>Boso.</i> Let us hear it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p11"><i>Anselm.</i> Had a perfect number of angels been created, and had man been made only to fill the place of the lost angels, it is plain that, had not some angels fallen from their happiness, man would never have, been exalted to it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p12"><i>Boso.</i> We are agreed.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p13"><i>Anselm.</i> But if any one shall ask: &#8220;Since the elect rejoice as much over the fall of angels as over their own exaltation, because the one can never take place without the other; how can they be justified in this unholy joy, or how shall we say that angels are restored by the substitution of men, if they (the angels) would have remained free from this fault, had they not fallen, viz., from rejoicing over the fall of others?&#8221; We reply: Cannot men be made free
from this fault? nay, how ought they to be happy with this fault? With what temerity, then, do we say that God neither wishes nor is able to make this substitution without this fault!</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p14"><i>Boso.</i> Is not the case similar to that of the Gentiles who were called unto faith, because the Jews rejected it?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p17"><i>Anselm.</i> Whence does that joy which one has over another&#8217;s fall seem to arise?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p18"><i>Boso.</i> Whence, to be sure, but from the fact that each individual will be certain that, had not another fallen, he would never have attained the place where he now is?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p19"><i>Anselm.</i> If, then, no one had this certainty, there would be no cause for one to rejoice over the doom of another.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p21"><i>Anselm.</i> Think you that any one of them can have this certainty, if their number shall far exceed that of those who fell?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p22"><i>Boso.</i> I certainly cannot think that any one would or ought to have it. For how can any one know whether he were created to restore the part diminished, or to make up that which was not yet complete in the number necessary to constitute the state? But all are sure that they were made with a view to the perfection of that kingdom.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p23"><i>Anselm.</i> If, then, there shall be a larger number than that of the fallen angels, no one can or ought to know that he would not have attained this height but for another&#8217;s fall.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p24"><i>Boso.</i> That is true.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p25"><i>Anselm.</i> No one, therefore, will have cause to rejoice over the perdition of another.</p>

<pb n="217" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_217.html" id="vi.ii.xviii-Page_217"/> 

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p27"><i>Anselm.</i> Since, then, we see that if there are more men elected than the number of fallen angels, the incongruity will not follow which must follow if there are not more men elected; and since it is impossible that there should be anything incongruous in that celestial state, it becomes a necessary fact that angels were not made perfect in number, and that there will be more happy men than doomed angels.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p28"><i>Boso.</i> I see not how this can be denied.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p29"><i>Anselm.</i> I think that another reason can be brought to support this opinion.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p30"><i>Boso.</i> You ought then to present it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p31"><i>Anselm.</i> We believe that the material substance of the world must be renewed, and that this will not take place until the number of the elect is accomplished, and that happy kingdom made perfect, and that after its completion there will be no change. Whence it may be reasoned that God planned to perfect both at the same time, in order that the inferior nature, which knew not God, might not be perfected before the superior nature which ought to enjoy God; and
that the inferior, being renewed at the same time with the superior, might, as it were, rejoice in its own way; yes, that every creature having so glorious and excellent a consummation, might delight in its Creator and in itself, in turn, rejoicing always after its own manner, so that what the will effects in the rational nature of its own accord, this also the irrational creature naturally shows by the arrangement of God. For we are wont to rejoice in the fame of our ancestors, as when on the
birthdays of the saints we delight with festive triumph, rejoicing in their honor. And this opinion derives support from the fact that, had not Adam sinned, God might yet put off the completion 
<pb n="218" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_218.html" id="vi.ii.xviii-Page_218"/>of that state until the number of men which he designed should be made out, and men themselves be transferred, so to speak, to an immortal state of bodily existence. For they had in paradise a kind of immortality, that is, a power not to die, but since it was possible for them to die, this power was
not immortal, as if, indeed, they had not been capable of death. But if God determined to bring to perfection, at one and the same time, that intelligent and happy state and this earthly and irrational nature; it follows that either that state was not complete in the number of angels before the destruction of the wicked, but God was waiting to complete it by men, when he should renovate the material nature of the world; or that, if that kingdom were perfect in number, it was not in
confirmation, and its confirmation must be deferred, even had no one sinned, until that renewal of the world to which we look forward; or that, if that confirmation could not be deferred so long, the renewal of the world must be hastened that both events might take place at the same time. But that God should determine to renew the world immediately after it was made, and to destroy in the very beginning those things which after this renewal would not exist, before any reason appeared for their
creation, is simply absurd. It therefore follows that, since angels were not complete in number, their confirmation will not be long deferred on this account, because the renewal of a world just created ought soon to take place, for this is not fitting. But that God should wish to put off their confirmation to the future renewing of the world seems improper, since he so quickly accomplished it in some, and since we know that in regard to our first parents, if they had not sinned as they did,

<pb n="219" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_219.html" id="vi.ii.xviii-Page_219"/>he would have confirmed them, as well as the angels who persevered. For, although not yet advanced to that equality with angels to which men were to attain, when the number taken from among them was complete; yet, had they preserved their original holiness, so as not to have sinned though tempted, they would have been confirmed, with all their offspring, so as never more to sin; just as when they were conquered by sin, they were so weakened as to be unable, in themselves, to live
afterwards without sinning. For who dares affirm that wickedness is more powerful to bind a man in servitude, after he has yielded to it at the first persuasion, than holiness to confirm him in liberty when he has adhered to it in the original trial? For as human nature, being included in the person of our first parents, was in them wholly won over to sin (with the single exception of that man whom God being able to create from a virgin was equally able to save from the sin of Adam), so had
they not sinned, human nature would have wholly conquered. It therefore remains that the celestial state was not complete in its original number, but must be completed from among men.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p32"><i>Boso.</i> What you say seems very reasonable to me. But what shall we think of that which is said respecting God: &#8220;He hath appointed the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel;&#8221; which some, because for the expression &#8220;children of Israel&#8221; is found sometimes &#8220;angels of God,&#8221; explain in this way, that the number of elect men taken should be understood as equal to that of good angels?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xviii-p33"><i>Anselm.</i> This is not discordant with the previous opinion, if it be not certain that the number of angels who fell is the same as that of those who stood. For 
<pb n="220" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_220.html" id="vi.ii.xviii-Page_220"/>if there be more elect than evil angels, and elect men must needs be substituted for the evil angels, and it is possible for them to equal the number of the good angels, in that case there will be more holy men than evil angels. But remember with what condition I undertook to answer your inquiry,
viz., that if I say anything not upheld by greater authority, though I appear to demonstrate it, yet it should be received with no further certainty than as my opinion for the present, until God makes some clearer revelation to me. For I am sure that, if I say anything which plainly opposes the Holy Scriptures, it is false; and if I am aware of it, I will no longer hold it. But if, with regard to subjects in which opposite opinions may be held without hazard, as that, for instance, which we now
discuss; for if we know not whether there are to be more men elected than the number of the lost angels, and incline to either of these opinions rather than the other, I think the soul is not in danger; if, I say, in questions like this, we explain the Divine words so as to make them favor different sides, and there is nowhere found anything to decide, beyond doubt, the opinion that should be held, I think there is no censure to be given. As to the passage which you spoke of: &#8220;He hath
determined the bounds of the people (or tribes) according to the number of the angels of God;&#8221; or as another translation has it: &#8220;according to the number of the children of Israel;&#8221; since both translations either mean the same thing, or are different, without contradicting each other, we may understand that good angels only are intended by both expressions, &#8220;angels of God,&#8221; and &#8220;children of Israel,&#8221; or that elect men only are meant, or that both angels and elect men are included, even the

<pb n="221" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_221.html" id="vi.ii.xviii-Page_221"/>whole celestial kingdom. Or by angels of God may be understood holy angels only, and by children of Israel, holy men only; or, by children of Israel, angels only, and by angels of God, holy men. If good angels are intended in both expressions, it is the same as if only &#8220;angels of God&#8221; had been used; but if the whole heavenly kingdom were included, the meaning is, that a people, that is, the throng of elect men, is to be taken, or that there will be a people in this stage of existence,
until the appointed number of that kingdom, not yet completed, shall be made up from among men. But I do not now see why angels only, or even angels and holy men together, are meant by the expression &#8220;children of Israel&#8221;; for it is not improper to call holy men &#8220;children of Israel,&#8221; as they are called &#8220;sons of Abraham.&#8221; And they can also properly be called &#8220;angels of God,&#8221; because they imitate the life of angels, and they are promised in heaven a likeness to and equality with angels, and all
who live holy lives are angels of God. Therefore the confessors or martyrs are so called; for he who declares and bears witness to the truth, he is a messenger of God, that is, his angel. And if a wicked man is called a devil, as our Lord says of Judas, because they are alike in malice; why should not a good man be called an angel, because he follows holiness? Wherefore I think we may say that God hath appointed the bounds of the people according to the number of elect men, because men will
exist and there will be a natural increase among them, until the number of elect men is accomplished; and when that occurs, the birth of men, which takes place in this life, will cease. But if by &#8220;angels of God&#8221; we only understand holy angels, and by &#8220;children of Israel &#8221; only holy men; it may 
<pb n="222" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_222.html" id="vi.ii.xviii-Page_222"/>be explained in two ways: that &#8220;God hath appointed the bounds of the people according to the number of the angels of God,&#8221; viz., either that so great a people, that is, so many men, will be taken as
there are holy angels of God, or that a people will continue to exist upon earth, until the number of angels is completed from among men. And I think there is no other possible method of explanation: &#8220;he hath appointed the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel,&#8221; that is, that there will continue to be a people in this stage of existence, as I said above, until the number of holy men is completed. And we infer from either translation that as many men will be
taken as there were angels who remained steadfast. Yet, although lost angels must have their ranks filled by men, it does not follow that the number of lost angels was equal to that of those who persevered. But if any one affirms this, he will have to find means of invalidating the reasons given above, which prove, I think, that there was not among angels, before the fall, that perfect number before mentioned, and that there are more men to be saved than the number of evil angels.</p>

For, had God chosen to restrain the devil, the devil could not have tempted man. Now I say, would not God be acting like this, should he restore man, stained with the defilement of sin, unwashed, that

For you do not deserve to have a thing which you do not love and desire for its own sake, and the want of which at present, together with the great danger of never getting it, causes you no grief. This also requires one to avoid ease and worldly pleasures such as seduce the mind from real rest and pleasure, except so far as you think suffices for the accomplishment of that object. 
<pb n="227" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_227.html" id="vi.ii.xx-Page_227"/>But you ought to
view the gifts which you bestow as a part of your debt, since you know that what you give comes not from yourself, but from him whose servant both you are and he also to whom you give. And nature herself teaches you to do to your fellow servant, man to man, as you would be done by; and that he who will not bestow what he has ought not to receive what he has not. Of forgiveness, indeed, I speak briefly, for, as we said above, vengeance in no sense belongs to you, since you are not your own, nor
is he who injures you yours or his, but you are both the servants of one Lord, made by him out of nothing. And if you avenge yourself upon your fellow servant, you proudly assume judgment over him when it is the peculiar right of God, the judge of all. But what do you give to God by your obedience, which is not owed him already, since he demands from you all that you are and have and can become?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxi-p8"><i>Boso.</i> I can find no motive which would make it right; unless, indeed I am so situated as to make it necessary for me either to do this, or some greater sin.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxi-p11"><i>Anselm.</i> Not to detain you too long; what if it were necessary either that the whole universe, except God himself, should perish and fall back into nothing, or else that you should do so small a thing against the will of God?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxi-p12"><i>Boso.</i> When I consider the action itself, it appears very slight; but when I view it as contrary to the will of God, I know of nothing so grievous, and of no loss that will compare with it; but sometimes we oppose another&#8217;s will without blame in order to preserve his property, so that afterwards he is glad that we opposed him.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxi-p13"><i>Anselm.</i> This is in the case of man, who often does not know what is useful for him, or cannot make up his loss; but God is in want of nothing, and, should all things perish, can restore them as easily as he created them.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxi-p17"><i>Anselm.</i> You cannot answer more correctly, but consider, also, should it happen that you gave the look contrary to God&#8217;s will, what payment you can make for this sin?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxii-p3"><i>Anselm.</i> Man being made holy was placed in paradise, as it were in the place of God, between God and the devil, to conquer the devil by not yielding to his temptation, and so to vindicate the honor of God and put the devil to shame, because that man, though weaker and dwelling upon earth, should not sin though tempted by the devil, while the devil, though stronger and in heaven, sinned without any to tempt him. And when man could have easily effected this,
he, without 
<pb n="231" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_231.html" id="vi.ii.xxii-Page_231"/>compulsion and of his own accord, allowed himself to be brought over to the will of the devil, contrary to the will and honor of God.</p>

Now the victory ought to be of this kind, that, as in strength and immortal vigor, he freely yielded to the devil to sin, and on this account justly incurred the penalty of death; so, in his
weakness and mortality, which he had brought upon himself, he should conquer the devil by the pain of death, while wholly avoiding sin. But this cannot be done, so long as from the deadly effect of the first transgression, man is conceived and born in sin.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p2">How, as long as man does not restore what he owes God, he cannot be happy, nor is he excused by want of power.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p3"><i>Anselm.</i> If a man is called unjust who does not pay his fellow-man a debt, much more is he unjust who does not restore what he owes God.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p4"><i>Boso.</i> If he can pay and yet does not, he is certainly unjust. But if he be not able, wherein is he unjust?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p5"><i>Anselm.</i> Indeed, if the origin of his inability were not in himself, there might be some excuse for him. But if in this very impotence lies the fault, as it does not lessen the sin, neither does it excuse him from paying what is due. Suppose one should assign his slave a certain piece of work, and should command him not to throw himself into a ditch, which he points out to him and from which he could not extricate himself; and suppose that the slave,
despising his master&#8217;s command and warning, throws himself into the ditch before pointed out, so as to be utterly unable to accomplish the work assigned; think you that his inability will at all excuse him for not doing his appointed work?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p6"><i>Boso.</i> By no means, but will rather increase his crime, since he brought his inability upon himself. For doubly hath he sinned, in not doing what he was 
<pb n="234" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_234.html" id="vi.ii.xxiv-Page_234"/>commanded to do and in doing what he was forewarned not to do.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p7"><i>Anselm.</i> Just so inexcusable is man, who has voluntarily brought upon himself a debt which he cannot pay, and by his own fault disabled himself, so that he can neither escape his previous obligation not to sin, nor pay the debt which he has incurred by sin. For his very inability is guilt, because he ought not to have it; nay, he ought to be free from it; for as it is a crime not to have what he ought, it is also a crime to have what he ought not. Therefore,
as it is a crime in man not to have that power which he received to avoid sin, it is also a crime to have that inability by which he can neither do right and avoid sin, nor restore the debt which he owes on account of his sin. For it is by his own free action that he loses that power, and falls into this inability. For not to have the power which one ought to have, is the same thing as to have the inability which one ought not to have. Therefore man&#8217;s inability to restore what he owes to God,
an inability brought upon himself for that very purpose, does not excuse man from paying; for the result of sin cannot excuse the sin itself.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p8"><i>Boso.</i> This argument is exceedingly weighty, and must be true.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p9"><i>Anselm.</i> Man, then, is unjust in not paying what he owes to God.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p10"><i>Boso.</i> This is very true; for he is unjust, both in not paying, and in not being able to pay.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p11"><i>Anselm.</i> But no unjust person shall be admitted to happiness; for as that happiness is complete in which there is nothing wanting, so it can belong to no one who is not so pure as to have no injustice found in him.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p12"><i>Boso.</i> I dare not think otherwise.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p13"><i>Anselm.</i> He, then, who does not pay God what he owes can never be happy.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p14"><i>Boso.</i> I cannot deny that this is so.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p15"><i>Anselm.</i> But if you choose to say that a merciful God remits to the suppliant his debt, because he cannot pay; God must be said to dispense with one of two things, viz., either this which man ought voluntarily to render but cannot, that is, an equivalent for his sin, a thing which ought not to be given up even to save the whole universe besides God; or else this, which, as I have before said, God was about to take away from man by punishment, even against
man&#8217;s will, viz., happiness. But if God gives up what man ought freely to render, for the reason that man cannot repay it, what is this but saying that God gives up what he is unable to obtain? But it is mockery to ascribe such compassion to God. But if God gives up what he was about to take from unwilling man, because man is unable to restore what he ought to restore freely, He abates the punishment and makes man happy on account of his sin, because he has what he ought not to have. For he
ought not to have this inability, and therefore as long as he has it without atonement it is his sin. And truly such compassion on the part of God is wholly contrary to the Divine justice, which allows nothing but punishment as the recompense of sin. Therefore, as God cannot be inconsistent with himself, his compassion cannot be of this nature.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p16"><i>Boso.</i> I think, then, we must look for another mercy than this.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p17"><i>Anselm.</i> But suppose it were true that God pardons
<pb n="236" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_236.html" id="vi.ii.xxiv-Page_236"/> the man who does not pay his debt because he cannot.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p18"><i>Boso.</i> I could wish it were so.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p19"><i>Anselm.</i> But while man does not make payment, he either wishes to restore, or else he does not wish to. Now, if he wishes to do what he cannot, he will be needy, and if he does not wish to, he will be unjust.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p20"><i>Boso.</i> Nothing can be plainer.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p21"><i>Anselm.</i> But whether needy or unjust, he will not be happy.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p22"><i>Boso.</i> This also is plain.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p23"><i>Anselm.</i> So long, then, as he does not restore, he will not be happy.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p24"><i>Boso.</i> If God follows the method of justice, there is no escape for the miserable wretch, and God&#8217;s compassion seems to fail.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p25"><i>Anselm.</i> You have demanded an explanation; now hear it. I do not deny that God is merciful, who preserveth man and beast, according to the multitude of his mercies. But we are speaking of that exceeding pity by which he makes man happy after this life. And I think that I have amply proved, by the reasons given above, that happiness ought not to be bestowed upon any one whose sins have not been wholly put away; and that this remission ought not to take place,
save by the payment of the debt incurred by sin, according to the extent of sin. And if you think that any objections can be brought against these proofs, you ought to mention them.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p26"><i>Boso.</i> I see not how your reasons can be at all invalidated.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p27"><i>Anselm.</i> Nor do I, if rightly understood. But even if one of the whole number be confirmed by impregnable

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p28"><i>Boso.</i> Surely this is so. But how, then, shall man be saved, if he neither pays what he owes, and ought not to be saved without paying? Or, with what face shall we declare that God, who is rich in mercy above human conception, cannot exercise this compassion?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxiv-p29"><i>Anselm.</i> This is the question which you ought to ask of those in whose behalf you are speaking, who have no faith in the need of Christ for man&#8217;s salvation, and you should also request them to tell how man can be saved without Christ.

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxv-p9"><i>Anselm.</i> Do you not perceive, from what we have said above, that it is necessary for some men to attain to felicity? For, if it is unfitting for God to elevate man with any stain upon him, to that for which he made him free from all stain, lest it should seem that God had repented of his good intent, or was unable to accomplish his designs; far more is it impossible, on account of the same unfitness, that no man should be exalted to that state for which he
was made. Therefore, a satisfaction such as we have above proved necessary for sin, must be found apart from the Christian faith, which no reason can show; or else we must accept the Christian doctrine. For what is clearly made out by absolute reasoning ought by no means to be questioned, even though the method of it be not understood.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.ii.xxv-p10"><i>Boso.</i> What you say is true.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.i-p3"><i>Anselm.</i> It ought not to be disputed that rational nature was made holy by God, in order to be happy in enjoying Him. For to this end is it rational, in order to discern justice and injustice, good and evil, and between the greater and the lesser good. Otherwise
<pb n="240" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_240.html" id="vi.iii.i-Page_240"/> it was made rational in vain. But God made it not rational in vain. Wherefore, doubtless, it was made rational for this end. In like manner is it proved that the intelligent creature received
the power of discernment for this purpose, that he might hate and shun evil, and love and choose good, and especially the greater good. For else in vain would God have given him that power of discernment, since man&#8217;s discretion would be useless unless he loved and avoided according to it. But it does not befit God to give such power in vain. It is, therefore, established that rational nature was created for this end, viz., to love and choose the highest good supremely, for its own sake and
nothing else; for if the highest good were chosen for any other reason, then something else and not itself would be the thing loved. But intelligent nature cannot fulfil this purpose without being holy. Therefore that it might not in vain be made rational, it was made, in order to fulfil this purpose, both rational and holy. Now, if it was made holy in order to choose and love the highest good, then it was made such in order to follow sometimes what it loved and chose, or else it was not. But
if it were not made holy for this end, that it might follow what it loves and chooses, then in vain was it made to love and choose holiness; and there can be no reason why it should be ever bound to follow holiness. Therefore, as long as it will be holy in loving and choosing the supreme good, for which it was made, it will be miserable; because it will be impotent despite of its will, inasmuch as it does not have what it desires. But this is utterly absurd. Wherefore rational nature was made
holy, in order to be happy in enjoying the supreme good, which is God. Therefore man, whose 
<pb n="241" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_241.html" id="vi.iii.i-Page_241"/>nature is rational, was made holy for this end, that he might be happy in enjoying God.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.v-p3"><i>Boso.</i> But if it be so, then God seems as it were compelled, for the sake of avoiding what is unbecoming
<pb n="243" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_243.html" id="vi.iii.v-Page_243"/>, to secure the salvation of man. How, then, can it be denied that he does it more on his own account than on ours? But if it be so, what thanks do we owe him for what he does for himself? How shall we attribute our salvation to his grace, if he saves us from necessity?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.v-p4"><i>Anselm.</i> There is a necessity which takes away or lessens our gratitude to a benefactor, and there is also a necessity by which the favor deserves still greater thanks. For when one does a benefit from a necessity to which he is unwillingly subjected, less thanks are due him, or none at all. But when he freely places himself under the necessity of benefiting another, and sustains that necessity without reluctance, then he certainly deserves greater thanks
for the favor. For this should not be called necessity but grace, inasmuch as he undertook or maintains it, not with any constraint, but freely. For if that which to-day you promise of your own accord you will give to-morrow, you do give to-morrow with the same willingness; though it be necessary for you, if possible, to redeem your promise, or make yourself a liar; notwithstanding, the recipient of your favor is as much indebted for your precious gift as if you had not promised it, for
you were not obliged to make yourself his debtor before the time of giving it: just so is it when one undertakes, by a vow, a design of holy living. For though after his vow he ought necessarily to perform, lest he suffer the judgment of an apostate, and, although he may be compelled to keep it even unwillingly, yet, if he keep his vow cheerfully, he is not less but more pleasing to God than if he had not vowed. For he has not only given up the life of the world, but also his personal liberty,
for the sake of God; and 
<pb n="244" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_244.html" id="vi.iii.v-Page_244"/>he cannot be said to live a holy life of necessity, but with the same freedom with which he took the vow. Much more, therefore, do we owe all thanks to God for completing his intended favor to man; though, indeed, it would not be proper for him to fail in his good design, because wanting nothing in himself he begun it for our sake and not his own. For what man was about to do was not hidden from God at his creation; and yet by freely creating man, God as it were
bound himself to complete the good which he had begun. In fine, God does nothing by necessity, since he is not compelled or restrained in anything. And when we say that God does anything to avoid dishonor, which he certainly does not fear, we must mean that God does this from the necessity of maintaining his honor; which necessity is after all no more than this, viz., the immutability of his honor, which belongs to him in himself, and is not derived from another; and therefore it is not
properly called necessity. Yet we may say, although the whole work which God does for man is of grace, that it is necessary for God, on account of his unchangeable goodness, to complete the work which he has begun.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.vii-p3"><i>Anselm.</i> The Divine and human natures cannot alternate, so that the Divine should become human or the human Divine; nor can they be so commingled as that a third should be produced from the two which is neither wholly Divine nor wholly human. For, granting that it were possible for either to be changed into the other, it would in that case be only God and not man, or man only and not God. Or, if they were 
<pb n="246" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_246.html" id="vi.iii.vii-Page_246"/>so commingled that a third nature sprung from
the combination of the two (as from two animals, a male and a female of different species, a third is produced, which does not preserve entire the species of either parent, but has a mixed nature derived from both), it would neither be God nor man. Therefore the God-man, whom we require to be of a nature both human and Divine, cannot be produced by a change from one into the other, nor by an imperfect commingling of both in a third; since these things cannot be, or, if they could be, would
avail nothing to our purpose. Moreover, if these two complete natures are said to be joined somehow, in such a way that one may be Divine while the other is human, and yet that which is God not be the same with that which is man, it is impossible for both to do the work necessary to be accomplished. For God will not do it, because he has no debt to pay; and man will not do it, because he cannot. Therefore, in order that the God-man may perform this, it is necessary that the same being should be
perfect God and perfect man, in order to make this atonement. For he cannot and ought not to do it, unless he be very God and very man. Since, then, it is necessary that the God-man preserve the completeness of each nature, it is no less necessary that these two natures be united entire in one person, just as a body and a reasonable soul exist together in every human being; for otherwise it is impossible that the same being should be very God and very man.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="vi.iii.viii-p2">How it behoved God to take a man of the race of Adam, and born of a woman.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.viii-p3"><i>Anselm.</i> It now remains to inquire whence and how God shall assume human nature. For he will either take it from Adam, or else he will make a new man, as he made Adam originally. But, if he makes a new man, not of Adam&#8217;s race, then this man will not belong to the human family, which descended from Adam, and therefore ought not to make atonement for it, because he never belonged to it. For, as it is right for man to make atonement for the sin of man, it is
also necessary that he who makes the atonement should be the very being who has sinned, or else one of the same race. Otherwise, neither Adam nor his race would make satisfaction for themselves. Therefore, as through Adam and Eve sin was propagated among all men, so none but themselves, or one born of them, ought to make atonement for the sin of men. And, since they cannot, one born of them must fulfil this work. Moreover, as Adam and his whole race, had he not sinned, would have stood firm
without the support of any other being, so, after the fall, the same race must rise and be exalted by means of itself. For, whoever restores the race to its place, it will certainly stand by that being who has made this restoration. Also, when God created human nature in Adam alone, and would only make woman out of man, that by the union of both sexes there might be increase, in this he showed plainly that he wished to produce all that he intended with regard to human 
<pb n="248" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_248.html" id="vi.iii.viii-Page_248"/>nature from man
alone. Wherefore, if the race of Adam be reinstated by any being not of the same race, it will not be restored to that dignity which it would have had, had not Adam sinned, and so will not be completely restored; and, besides, God will seem to have failed of his purpose, both which suppositions are incongruous: It is, therefore, necessary that the man by whom Adam&#8217;s race shall be restored be taken from Adam.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.viii-p4"><i>Boso.</i> If we follow reason, as we proposed to do, this is the necessary result.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.viii-p5"><i>Anselm.</i> Let us now examine the question, whether the human nature taken by God must be produced from a father and mother, as other men are, or from man alone, or from woman alone. For, in whichever of these three modes it be, it will be produced from Adam and Eve, for from these two is every person of either sex descended. And of these three modes, no one is easier for God than another, that it should be selected on this account.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.viii-p6"><i>Boso.</i> So far, it is well.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.viii-p7"><i>Anselm.</i> It is no great toil to show that that man will be brought into existence in a nobler and purer manner, if produced from man alone, or woman alone, than if springing from the union of both, as do all other men.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.viii-p8"><i>Boso.</i> I agree with you.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.viii-p9"><i>Anselm.</i> Therefore must he be taken either from man alone, or woman alone.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.viii-p10"><i>Boso.</i> There is no other source.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.viii-p11"><i>Anselm.</i> In four ways can God create man, viz., either of man and woman, in the common way; or neither of man nor woman, as he created Adam; or of man without woman, as he made Eve; or of woman 
<pb n="249" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_249.html" id="vi.iii.viii-Page_249"/>without man, which thus far he has never done. Wherefore, in order to show that this last mode also under his power, and was reserved for this very purpose, what more fitting than that he should take that man whose origin we are seeking from a woman without a
man? Now whether it be more worthy that he be born of a virgin, or one not a virgin, we need not discuss, but must affirm, beyond all doubt, that the God-man should be born of a virgin.</p>

And that women may not despair of attaining the inheritance of the blessed, because that so dire an evil arose from woman, it is proper that from woman also so great a blessing should arise,
that their hopes may be revived. Take also this view. If it was a virgin which brought all evil upon the race, it is much more appropriate that a virgin should be the occasion of all good. And this also. If woman, whom God made from man alone, was made of a virgin (<span lang="la" id="vi.iii.viii-p15.1"><span lang="la" id="vi.iii.viii-p15.2"><i>de virgine</i></span></span>), it is peculiarly fitting for that man also, who shall spring from a woman, to be born of a woman without man.

this, showing that the God-man ought to be born of a virgin, we will say nothing. These are sufficient.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="vi.iii.ix-p2">How of necessity the Word only can unite in one person with man.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.ix-p3"><i>Anselm.</i> Now must we inquire further, in what person God, who exists in three persons, shall take upon himself the nature of man. For a plurality of persons cannot take one and the same man into a unity of person. Wherefore in one person only can this be done. But, as respects this personal unity of God and man, and in which of the Divine persons this ought to be effected, I have expressed myself, as far as I think needful for the present inquiry, in a
letter on the Incarnation of the Word, addressed to my lord, the Pope Urban.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.ix-p4"><i>Boso.</i> Yet briefly glance at this matter, why the person of the Son should be incarnated rather than that of the Father or the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.ix-p5"><i>Anselm.</i> If one of the other persons be incarnated, there will be two sons in the Trinity, viz., the Son of God, who is the Son before the incarnation, and he also who, by the incarnation, will be the son of the virgin; and among the persons which ought always to be equal there will be an inequality as respects the dignity of birth. For the one born of God will have a nobler birth than he who is born of the virgin. Likewise, if the Father become incarnate,
there will be two grandsons in the Trinity; for the Father, by assuming humanity, will be the grandson of the parents of the virgin, and the Word, though having nothing to do with man, will yet be the grandson of the virgin, since he will be the son of her son. But all these 
<pb n="251" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_251.html" id="vi.iii.ix-Page_251"/>things are incongruous and do not pertain to the incarnation of the Word. And there is yet another reason which renders it more fitting for the Son to become incarnate than the other persons. It is, that for the Son to
pray to the Father is more proper than for any other person of the Trinity to supplicate his fellow. Moreover, man, for whom he was to pray, and the devil, whom he was to vanquish, have both put on a false likeness to God by their own will. Wherefore they have sinned, as it were, especially against the person of the Son, who is believed to be the very image of God. Wherefore the punishment or pardon of guilt is with peculiar propriety ascribed to him upon whom chiefly the injury was inflicted.
Since, therefore, infallible reason has brought us to this necessary conclusion, that the Divine and human natures must unite in one person, and that this is evidently more fitting in respect to the person of the Word than the other persons, we determine that God the Word must unite with man in one person.</p>

<pb n="253" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_253.html" id="vi.iii.x-Page_253"/>me. So we can say of Christ, that he could
lie, so long as we understand, if he chose to do so. And, since he could not lie unwillingly and could not wish to lie, none the less can it be said that he could not lie. So in this way it is both true that he could and could not lie.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.x-p8"><i>Boso.</i> Now let us return to our original inquiry with regard to that man, as if nothing were known of him. I say, then, if he were unable to sin, because, according to you, he could not wish to sin, he maintains holiness of necessity, and therefore he will not be holy from free will. What thanks, then, will he deserve for his holiness? For we are accustomed to say that God made man and angel capable of sinning on this account, that, when of their own free
will they maintained holiness, though they might have abandoned it, they might deserve commendation and reward, which they would not have done had they been necessarily holy.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.x-p9"><i>Anselm.</i> Are not the angels worthy of praise, though unable to commit sin?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.x-p10"><i>Boso.</i> Doubtless they are, because they deserved this present inability to sin from the fact that when they could sin they refused to do so.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.x-p11"><i>Anselm.</i> What say you with respect to God, who cannot sin, and yet has not deserved this, by refusing to sin when he had the power? Must not he be praised for his holiness?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.x-p12"><i>Boso.</i> I should like to have you answer that question for me; for if I say that he deserves no praise, I know that I speak falsely. If, on the other hand, I say that he does deserve praise, I am afraid of invalidating my reasoning with respect to the angels.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.x-p13"><i>Anselm.</i> The angels are not to be praised for their 
<pb n="254" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_254.html" id="vi.iii.x-Page_254"/>holiness because they could sin, but because it is owing to themselves, in a certain sense, that now they cannot sin. And in this respect are they in a measure like God, who has, from himself, whatever he possesses. For a person is said to give a thing, who does not take it away when he can; and to do a thing is but the same as not to prevent it, when that is in one&#8217;s power. When, therefore, the angel
could depart from holiness and yet did not, and could make himself unholy yet did not, we say with propriety that he conferred virtue upon himself and made himself holy. In this sense, therefore, has he holiness of himself (for the creature cannot have it of himself in any other way), and, therefore, should be praised for his holiness, because he is not holy of necessity but freely; for that is improperly called necessity which involves neither compulsion nor restraint. Wherefore, since
whatever God has he has perfectly of himself, he is most of all to be praised for the good things which he possesses and maintains not by any necessity, but, as before said, by his own infinite unchangeableness. Therefore, likewise, that man who will be also God since every good thing which he possesses comes from himself, will be holy not of necessity but voluntarily, and, therefore, will deserve praise. For, though human nature will have what it has from the Divine nature, yet it will
likewise have it from itself, since the two natures will be united in one person.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.x-p14"><i>Boso.</i> You have satisfied me on this point; and I see clearly that it is both true that he could not sin, and yet that he deserves praise for his holiness. But now I think the question arises, since God could make such a man, why he did not create angels and our 
<pb n="255" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_255.html" id="vi.iii.x-Page_255"/>first parents so as to be incapable of sin, and yet praiseworthy for their holiness?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.x-p15"><i>Anselm.</i> Do you know what you are saying?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.x-p16"><i>Boso.</i> I think I understand, and it is therefore I ask why he did not make them so.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.x-p17"><i>Anselm.</i> Because it was neither possible nor right for any one of them to be the same with God, as we say that man was. And if you ask why he did not bring the three persons, or at least the Word, into unity with men at that time, I answer: Because reason did not at all demand any such thing then, but wholly forbade it, for God does nothing without reason.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.x-p18"><i>Boso.</i> I blush to have asked the question. Go on with what you have to say.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.x-p19"><i>Anselm.</i> We must conclude, then, that he should not be subject to death, inasmuch as he will not be a sinner.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="vi.iii.xi-p2">How Christ dies of his own power, and how mortality does not inhere in the essential nature of man.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p3"><i>Anselm.</i> Now, also, it remains to inquire whether, as man&#8217;s nature is, it is possible for that man to die?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p4"><i>Boso.</i> We need hardly dispute with regard to this, since he will be really man, and every man is by nature mortal.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p5"><i>Anselm.</i> I do not think mortality inheres in the essential nature of man, but only as corrupted. Since, had man never sinned, and had his immortality been unchangeably confirmed, he would have been as really man; and, when the dying rise again, incorruptible, 
<pb n="256" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_256.html" id="vi.iii.xi-Page_256"/>they will no less be really men. For, if mortality was an essential attribute of human nature, then he who was immortal could not be man. Wherefore, neither corruption nor incorruption belong
essentially to human nature, for neither makes nor destroys a man; but happiness accrues to him from the one, and misery from the other. But since all men die, mortality is included in the definition of man, as given by philosophers, for they have never even believed in the possibility of man&#8217;s being immortal in all respects. And so it is not enough to prove that that man ought to be subject to death, for us to say that he will be in all respects a man.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p6"><i>Boso.</i> Seek then for some other reason, since I know of none, if you do not, by which we may prove that he can die.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p7"><i>Anselm.</i> We may not doubt that, as he will be God, he will possess omnipotence.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p8"><i>Boso.</i> Certainly.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p9"><i>Anselm.</i> He can, then, if he chooses, lay down his life and take it again.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p10"><i>Boso.</i> If not, he would scarcely seem to be omnipotent.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p11"><i>Anselm.</i> Therefore is he able to avoid death if he chooses, and also to die and rise again. Moreover, whether he lays down his life by the intervention of no other person, or another causes this, so that he lays it down by permitting it to be taken, it makes no difference as far as regards his power.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p12"><i>Boso.</i> There is no doubt about it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p13"><i>Anselm.</i> If, then, he chooses to allow it, he could be slain; and if he were unwilling to allow it, he couId not be slain.</p>

<pb n="257" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_257.html" id="vi.iii.xi-Page_257"/> 

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p14"><i>Boso.</i> To this we are unavoidably brought by reason.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p15"><i>Anselm</i>. Reason has also taught us that the gift which he presents to God, not of debt but freely, ought to be something greater than anything in the possession of God.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p16"><i>Boso.</i> Yes.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p17">Anselin. Now this can neither be found beneath him nor above him.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p18"><i>Boso.</i> Very true.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p19"><i>Anselm.</i> In himself, therefore, must it be found.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p20"><i>Boso.</i> So it appears.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p21"><i>Anselm.</i> Therefore will he give himself, or something pertaining to himself.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p22"><i>Boso.</i> I cannot see how it should be otherwise.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p23"><i>Anselm.</i> Now must we inquire what sort of a gift this should be? For he may not give himself to God, or anything of his, as if God did not have what was his own. For every creature belongs to God.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p24"><i>Boso.</i> This is so.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p25"><i>Anselm.</i> Therefore must this gift be understood in this way, that he somehow gives up himself, or something of his, to the honor of God, which he did not owe as a debtor.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p26"><i>Boso.</i> So it seems from what has been already said.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p27"><i>Anselm.</i> If we say that he will give himself to God by obedience, so as, by steadily maintaining holiness, to render himself subject to his will, this will not be giving a thing not demanded of him by God as his due. For every reasonable being owes his obedience to God.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p28"><i>Boso.</i> This cannot be denied.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p29"><i>Anselm.</i> Therefore must it be in some other way 
<pb n="258" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_258.html" id="vi.iii.xi-Page_258"/>that he gives himself, or something belonging to him, to God.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p30"><i>Boso.</i> Reason urges us to this conclusion.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p31">Anslem. Let us see whether, perchance, this may be to give up his life or to lay down his life, or to deliver himself up to death for God&#8217;s honor. For God will not demand this of him as a debt; for, as no sin will be found, he ought not to die, as we have already said.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p32"><i>Boso.</i> Else I cannot understand it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p33"><i>Anselm.</i> But let us further observe whether this is according to reason.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p34"><i>Boso.</i> Speak you, and I will listen with pleasure.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p35"><i>Anselm.</i> If man sinned with ease, is it not fitting for him to atone with difficulty? And if he was overcome by the devil in the easiest manner possible, so as to dishonor God by sinning against him, is it not right that man, in making satisfaction for his sin, should honor God by conquering the devil with the greatest possible difficulty? Is it not proper that, since man has departed from God as far as possible in his sin, he should make to God the greatest
possible satisfaction?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p36"><i>Boso.</i> Surely, there is nothing more reasonable.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p37"><i>Anselm.</i> Now, nothing can be more severe or difficult for man to do for God&#8217;s honor, than to suffer death voluntarily when not bound by obligation; and man cannot give himself to God in any way more truly than by surrendering himself to death for God&#8217;s honor.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p38"><i>Boso.</i> All these things are true.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p39"><i>Anselm.</i> Therefore, he who wishes to make atonement for man&#8217;s sin should be one who can die if he chooses.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p40"><i>Boso.</i> I think it is plain that the man whom we 
<pb n="259" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_259.html" id="vi.iii.xi-Page_259"/>seek for should not only be one who is not necessarily subject to death on account of his omnipotence, and one who does not deserve death on account of his sin, but also one who can die of his own free will, for this will be necessary.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xi-p41"><i>Anselm.</i> There are also many other reasons why it is peculiarly fitting for that man to enter into the common intercourse of men, and maintain a likeness to them, only without sin. And these things are more easily and clearly manifest in his life and actions than they can possibly be shown to be by mere reason without experience. For who can say how necessary and wise a thing it was for him who was to redeem mankind, and lead them back by his teaching from
the way of death and destruction into the path of life and eternal happiness, when he conversed with men, and when he taught them by personal intercourse, to set them an example himself of the way in which they ought to live? But how could he have given this example to weak and dying men, that they should not deviate from holiness because of injuries, or scorn, or tortures, or even death, had they not been able to recognise all these virtues in himself?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xiii-p4"><i>Anselm.</i> Do you doubt the omnipotence of God?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xiii-p5"><i>Boso.</i> No! but, although this man be immortal in respect to his Divine nature, yet will he be mortal in his human nature. For why will he not be like them in their ignorance, as he is in their mortality?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xiii-p6"><i>Anselm.</i> That union of humanity with the Divine person will not be effected except in accordance with the highest wisdom; and, therefore, God will not take anything belonging to man which is only useless, but even a hindrance to the work which that man must accomplish. For ignorance is in no respect useful, but very prejudicial. How can he perform works, so many and so great, without the highest wisdom? Or, how will men believe him if they find him ignorant?
And if he be ignorant, what will it avail him? If nothing is loved except as it is known, and there be no good thing which he does not love, then there can be no good thing of which He is ignorant. But no one perfectly understands good, save he who can distinguish it from evil; and no one can make this distinction who does not know what evil is. Therefore, as he of whom we are speaking perfectly comprehends 
<pb n="261" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_261.html" id="vi.iii.xiii-Page_261"/>what is good, so there can be no evil with which he is unacquainted. Therefore must
he have all knowledge, though he do not openly show it in his intercourse with men.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xiii-p7"><i>Boso.</i> In his more mature years, this should seem to be as you say; but, in infancy, as it will not be a fit time to discover wisdom, so there will be no need, and therefore no propriety, in his having it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xiii-p8"><i>Anselm.</i> Did not I say that the incarnation will be made in wisdom? But God will in wisdom assume that mortality, which he makes use of so widely, because for so great an object. But he could not wisely assume ignorance, for this is never useful, but always injurious, except when an evil will is deterred from acting, on account of it. But, in him an evil desire never existed. For if ignorance did no harm in any other respect, yet does it in this, that it
takes away the good of knowing. And to answer your question in a word: that man, from the essential nature of his being, will be always full of God; and, therefore, will never want the power, the firmness or the wisdom of God.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xiii-p9"><i>Boso.</i> Though wholly unable to doubt the truth of this with respect to Christ, yet, on this very account, have I asked for the reason of it. For we are often certain about a thing, and yet cannot prove it by reason.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xv-p3"><i>Boso.</i> This is properly so with regard to all sins not affecting the person of the Deity. But let me ask you one thing more. If it be as great an evil to slay him as his life is a good, how can his death overcome 
<pb n="264" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_264.html" id="vi.iii.xv-Page_264"/>and destroy the sins of those who slew him? Or, if it destroys the sin of any one of them, how can it not also destroy any sin committed by other men? For we believe that many men will be saved, and a vast many will not be saved.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xv-p4"><i>Anselm.</i> The Apostle answers the question when he says: &#8220;Had they known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.&#8221; For a sin knowingly committed and a sin done ignorantly are so different that an evil which they could never do, were its full extent known, may be pardonable when done in ignorance. For no man could ever, knowingly at least, slay the Lord; and, therefore, those who did it in ignorance did not rush into that transcendental crime
with which none others can be compared. For this crime, the magnitude of which we have been considering as equal to the worth of his life, we have not looked at as having been ignorantly done, but knowingly; a thing which no man ever did or could do.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xv-p6"><i>Anselm.</i> What more do you ask? For now you see how reason of necessity shows that the celestial state must be made up from men, and that this can only be by the forgiveness of sins, which man can never have but by man, who must be at the same time Divine, and reconcile sinners to God by his own death. Therefore have we clearly found that Christ, whom we confess to be both God and man, died for us; and, when this is known beyond all doubt, all things which
he says of himself must be acknowledged as true, for God cannot lie, and all he does must be received as wisely done, though we do not understand the reason of it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvi-p3"><i>Boso.</i> As, therefore, you have disclosed the reason of those things mentioned above, I beg you will also explain what I am now about to ask. First, then, how does God, from a sinful substance, that is, of human species, which was wholly tainted by sin, take, a man without sin, as an unleavened lump from that which is leavened? For, though the conception of this man be pure, and free from the sin of fleshly gratification, yet the virgin herself, from whom he
sprang, was conceived in iniquity, and in sin did her mother bear her, since she herself sinned in Adam, in whom all men sinned.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvi-p4"><i>Anselm.</i> Since it is fitting for that man to be God, and also the restorer of sinners, we doubt not that he is wholly without sin; yet will this avail nothing, unless he be taken without sin and yet of a sinful substance. But if we cannot comprehend in what manner the wisdom of God effects this, we should be surprised, but with reverence should allow of a thing of so great magnitude to remain hidden from us. For the restoring of human nature by God is more
wonderful
<pb n="266" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_266.html" id="vi.iii.xvi-Page_266"/> than its creation; for either was equally easy for God; but before man was made he had not sinned so that he ought not to be denied existence. But after man was made he deserved, by his sin, to lose his existence together with its design; though he never has wholly lost this, viz., that he should be one capable of being punished, or of receiving God&#8217;s compassion. For neither of these things could take effect if he were annihilated. Therefore God&#8217;s restoring man is more wonderful
than his creating man, inasmuch as it is done for the sinner contrary to his deserts; while the act of creation was not for the sinner, and was not in opposition to man&#8217;s deserts. How great a thing it is, also, for God and man to unite in one person, that, while the perfection of each nature is preserved, the same being may be both God and man! Who, then, will dare to think that the human mind can discover how wisely, how wonderfully, so incomprehensible a work has been accomplished?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvi-p5"><i>Boso.</i> I allow that no man can wholly discover so great a mystery in this life, and I do not desire you to do what no man can do, but only to explain it according to your ability. For you will sooner convince me that deeper reasons lie concealed in this matter, by showing some one that you know of, than if, by saying nothing, you make it appear that you do not understand any reason.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvi-p6"><i>Anselm.</i> I see that I cannot escape your importunity; but if I have any power to explain what you wish, let us thank God for it. But if not, let the things above said suffice. For, since it is agreed that God ought to become man, no doubt He will not lack the wisdom or the power to effect this without sin.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvi-p8"><i>Anselm.</i> It was certainly proper that that atonement which Christ made should benefit not only those who lived at that time but also others. For, suppose there were a king against whom all the people of his provinces had rebelled, with but a single exception of those belonging to their race, and that all the rest were irretrievably under condemnation. And suppose that he who alone is blameless had so great favor with the king, and so deep love for us, as to
be both able and willing to save all those who trusted in his guidance; and this because of a certain very pleasing service which he was about to do for the king, according to his desire; and, inasmuch as those who are to be pardoned cannot all assemble upon that day, the king grants, on account of the greatness of the service performed, that whoever, either before or after the day appointed, acknowledged that he wished to obtain pardon by the work that day accomplished, and to subscribe to the
condition there laid down, should be freed from all past guilt; and, if they sinned after this pardon, and yet wished to render atonement and to be set right again by the efficacy of this plan, they should again be pardoned, only provided that no one enter his mansion until this thing be accomplished by which his sins are removed. In like manner, since all who are to be saved cannot be present at the sacrifice of Christ, yet such virtue is there in his death that its power is extended even to
those far remote in place or time. But that it ought to benefit not merely those present is plainly evident, because there could not be so many living at the time of his death as are necessary to complete the heavenly state, even if all who were upon the earth at that time were admitted to the benefits of redemption. For the number of evil 
<pb n="268" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_268.html" id="vi.iii.xvi-Page_268"/>angels which must be made up from men is greater than the number of men at that time living. Nor may we believe that, since man was created, there was
ever a time when the world, with the creatures made for the use of man, was so unprofitable as to contain no human being who had gained the object for which he was made. For it seems unfitting that God should even for a moment allow the human race, made to complete the heavenly state, and those creatures which he made for their use, to exist in vain.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvi-p9"><i>Boso.</i> You show by correct reasoning, such as nothing can oppose, that there never was a time since man was created when there has not been some one who was gaining that reconciliation without which every man was made in vain. So that we rest upon this as not only proper but also necessary. For if this is more fit and reasonable than that at any time there should be no one found fulfilling the design for which God made man, and there is no further objection
that can be made to this view, then it is necessary that there always be some person partaking of this promised pardon. And, therefore, we must not doubt that Adam and Eve obtained part in that forgiveness, though Divine authority makes no mention of this.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvi-p10"><i>Anselm.</i> It is also incredible that God created them, and unchangeably determined to make all men from them, as many as were needed for the celestial state, and yet should exclude these two from this design.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvi-p11"><i>Boso.</i> Nay, undoubtedly we ought to believe that God made them for this purpose, viz., to belong to the number of those for whose sake they were created.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvi-p12"><i>Anselm.</i> You understand it well. But no soul, before the death of Christ, could enter the heavenly 
<pb n="269" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_269.html" id="vi.iii.xvi-Page_269"/>kingdom, as I said above, with regard to the palace of the king.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvi-p13"><i>Boso.</i> So we believe.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvi-p14"><i>Anselm.</i> Moreover, the virgin, from whom that man was taken of whom we are speaking, was of the number of those who were cleansed from their sins before his birth, and he was born of her in her purity.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvi-p15"><i>Boso.</i> What you say would satisfy me, were it not that he ought to be pure of himself, whereas he appears to have his purity from his mother and not from himself.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvi-p16"><i>Anselm.</i> Not so. But as the mother&#8217;s purity, which he partakes, was only derived from him, he also was pure by and of himself.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p3"><i>Boso.</i> Thus far it is well. But there is yet another matter that needs to be looked into. For we have said before that his death was not to be a matter of necessity; yet now we see that his mother was purified by the power of his death, when without this he could not have been born of her. How, then, was not his death necessary, when he could not have been, except in view of future death? For if he were not to die, the virgin of whom he was born could not be
pure, since this could only be effected by true faith in his death, and, if she were not pure, he could not be born of her. If, therefore, his death be not a necessary consequence of his being born of the virgin, he never could have been born of her at all; but this is an absurdity.</p>

<pb n="270" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_270.html" id="vi.iii.xvii-Page_270"/> 

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p4"><i>Anselm.</i> If you had carefully noted the remarks made above, you would easily have discovered in them, I think, the answer to your question.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p5"><i>Boso.</i> I see not how.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p6"><i>Anselm.</i> Did we not find, when considering the question whether he would lie, that there were two senses of the word <i>power</i> in regard to it, the one referring to his disposition, the other to the act itself; and that, though having the power to lie, he was so constituted by nature as not to wish to lie, and, therefore, deserved praise for his holiness in maintaining the truth?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p7"><i>Boso.</i> It is so.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p8"><i>Anselm.</i> In like manner, with regard to the preservation of his life, there is the power of preserving and the power of wishing to preserve it. And when the question is asked whether the same God-man could preserve his life, so as never to die, we must not doubt that he always had the power to preserve his life, though he could not wish to do so for the purpose of escaping death. And since this disposition, which forever prevents him from wishing this,
arises from himself, he lays down his life not of necessity, but of free authority.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p9"><i>Boso.</i> But those powers were not in all respects similar, the power to lie and the power to preserve his life. For, if he wished to lie, he would of course be able to; but, if he wished to avoid the other, he could no more do it than he could avoid being what he is. For he became man for this purpose, and it was on the faith of his coming death that he could receive birth from a virgin, as you said above.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p10"><i>Anselm.</i> As you think that he could not lie, or that his death was necessary, because be could not avoid 
<pb n="271" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_271.html" id="vi.iii.xvii-Page_271"/>being what he was, so you can assert that he could not wish to avoid death, or that he wished to die of necessity, because he could not change the constitution of his being; for he did not become man in order that he should die, any more than for this purpose, that he should wish to die. Wherefore, as you ought not to say that he could not help
wishing to die, or that it was of necessity that he wished to die, it is equally improper to say that he could not avoid death, or that he died of necessity.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p11"><i>Boso.</i> Yes, since dying and wishing to die are included in the same mode of reasoning, both would seem to fall under a like necessity.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p12"><i>Anselm.</i> Who freely wished to become man, that by the same unchanging desire he should suffer death, and that the virgin from whom that man should be born might be pure, through confidence in the certainty of this?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p13"><i>Boso.</i> God, the Son of God.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p14"><i>Anselm.</i> Was it not above shown, that no desire of God is at all constrained; but that it freely maintains itself in his own unchangeableness, as often as it is said that he does anything necessarily?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p15"><i>Boso.</i> It has been clearly shown. But we see, on the other hand, that what God unchangeably wishes cannot avoid being so, but takes place of necessity. Wherefore, if God wished that man to die, he could but die.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p16"><i>Anselm.</i> Because the Son of God took the nature of man with this desire, viz., that he should suffer death, you prove it necessary that this man should not be able to avoid death.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p17"><i>Boso.</i> So I perceive.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p18"><i>Anselm.</i> Has it not in like manner appeared from 
<pb n="272" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_272.html" id="vi.iii.xvii-Page_272"/>the things which we have spoken that the Son of God and the man whose person he took were so united that the same being should be both God and man, the Son of God and the son of the virgin?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p19"><i>Boso.</i> It is so.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p20"><i>Anselm.</i> Therefore the same man could possibly both die and avoid death.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p21"><i>Boso.</i> I cannot deny it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p22"><i>Anselm.</i> Since, then, the will of God does nothing by any necessity, but of his own power, and the will of that man was the same as the will of God, he died not necessarily, but only of his own power.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p23"><i>Boso.</i> To your arguments I cannot object; for neither your propositions nor your inferences can I invalidate in the least. But yet this thing which I have mentioned always recurs to my mind: that, if he wished to avoid death, he could no more do it than he could escape existence. For it must have been fixed that he was to die, for had it not been true that he was about to die, faith in his coming death would not have existed, by which the virgin who gave him
birth and many others also were cleansed from their sin. Wherefore, if he could avoid death, he could make untrue what was true.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p24"><i>Anselm.</i> Why was it true, before he died, that he was certainly to die?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p25"><i>Boso.</i> Because this was his free and unchangeable desire.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p26"><i>Anselm.</i> If, then, as you say, he could not avoid death because he was certainly to die, and was on this account certainly to die because it was his free and unchangeable desire, it is clear that his inability to avoid death is nothing else but his fixed choice to die.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p27"><i>Boso.</i> This is so; but whatever be the reason, it 
<pb n="273" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_273.html" id="vi.iii.xvii-Page_273"/>still remains certain that he could not avoid death, but that it was a necessary thing for him to die.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xvii-p29"><i>Boso.</i> Are you not forgetting my reply to the excuses you made at the beginning of our discussion, viz., that you should explain the subject, not as to learned men, but to me and my fellow inquirers?

<p class="SectionInfo" id="vi.iii.xviii-p3">How, with God there is neither necessity nor impossibility, and what is a coercive necessity, and what one that is not so.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xviii-p4"><i>Anselm.</i> We have already said that it is improper to affirm of God that he does anything, or that he cannot do it, of necessity. For all necessity and impossibility is under his control. But his choice is subject to no necessity nor impossibility. For nothing is necessary or impossible save as He wishes it. Nay, the very choosing or refusing anything as a necessity or an impossibility is contrary to truth. Since, then, he does what he chooses and nothing
else, as no necessity or impossibility exists before his choice or refusal, so neither do they interfere with his acting or not acting, though it be true that his choice and action are immutable. And as, when God does a thing, since it has been done it cannot be undone, but must remain an actual fact; still, we are not correct in saying that it is impossible for God to prevent a past action 
<pb n="274" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_274.html" id="vi.iii.xviii-Page_274"/>from being what it is. For there is no necessity or impossibility in the case whatever but the
simple will of God, which chooses that truth should be eternally the same, for he himself is truth. Also, if he has a fixed determination to do anything, though his design must be destined to an accomplishment before it comes to pass, yet there is no coercion as far as he is concerned, either to do it or not to do it, for his will is the sole agent in the case. For when we say that God cannot do a thing, we do not deny his power; on the contrary, we imply that he has invincible authority and
strength. For we mean simply this, that nothing can compel God to do the thing which is said to be impossible for him. We often use an expression of this kind, that a thing can be when the power is not in itself, but in something else; and that it cannot be when the weakness does not pertain to the thing itself, but to something else. Thus we say &#8220;Such a man can be bound,&#8221; instead of saying, &#8220;Somebody can bind him,&#8221; and, &#8220;He cannot be bound,&#8221; instead of, &#8220;Nobody can bind him.&#8221; For to be able to
be overcome is not power but weakness, and not to be able to be overcome is not weakness but power. Nor do we say that God does anything by necessity, because there is any such thing pertaining to him, but because it exists in something else, precisely as I said with regard to the affirmation that he cannot do anything. For necessity is always either compulsion or restraint; and these two kinds of necessity operate variously by turn, so that the same thing is both necessary and impossible. For
whatever is obliged to exist is also prevented from non-existence; and that which is compelled not to exist is prevented from existence. So that whatever exists from necessity cannot
<pb n="275" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_275.html" id="vi.iii.xviii-Page_275"/> avoid existence, and it is impossible for a thing to exist which is under a necessity of nonexistence, and <i>vice versa</i>. But when we say with regard to God, that anything is necessary or not necessary, we do not mean that, as far as he is concerned, there is any necessity either coercive or prohibitory,
but we mean that there is a necessity in everything else, restraining or driving them in a particular way. Whereas we say the very opposite of God. For, when we affirm that it is necessary for God to utter truth, and never to lie, we only mean that such is his unwavering disposition to maintain the truth that of necessity nothing can avail to make him deviate from the truth, or utter a lie. When, then, we say that that man (who, by the union of persons, is also God, the Son of God) could not
avoid death, or the choice of death, after he was born of the virgin, we do not imply that there was in him any weakness with regard to preserving or choosing to preserve his life, but we refer to the unchangeableness of his purpose, by which he freely became man for this design, viz., that by persevering in his wish he should suffer death. And this desire nothing could shake. For it would be rather weakness than power if he could wish to lie, or deceive, or change his disposition, when before
he had chosen that it should remain unchanged. And, as I said before, when one has freely determined to do some good action, and afterwards goes on to complete it, though, if unwilling to pay his vow, he could be compelled to do so, yet we must not say that he does it of necessity, but with the same freedom with which he made the resolution. For we ought not to say that anything is done, or not done, by necessity or weakness, when free choice is the only agent in the case. And, if this 
<pb n="276" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_276.html" id="vi.iii.xviii-Page_276"/>is
so with regard to man, much less can we speak of necessity or weakness in reference to God; for he does nothing except according to his choice, and his will no force can drive or restrain. For this end was accomplished by the united natures of Christ, viz., that the Divine nature should perform that part of the work needful for man&#8217;s restoration which the human nature could not do; and that in the human should be manifested what was inappropriate to the Divine. Finally, the virgin herself, who
was made pure by faith in him, so that he might be born of her, even she, I say, never believed that he was to die, save of his own choice. For she knew the words of the prophet, who said of him: &#8220;He was offered of his own will.&#8221; Therefore, since her faith was well founded, it must necessarily turn out as she believed. And, if it perplexes you to have me say that it is necessary, remember that the reality of the virgin&#8217;s faith was not the cause of his dying by his own free will; but, because
this was destined to take place, therefore her faith was real. If, then, it be said that it was necessary for him to die of his single choice, because the antecedent faith and prophecy were true, this is no more than saying that it must be because it was to be. But such a necessity as this does not compel a thing to be, but only implies a necessity of its existence. There is an antecedent necessity which is the cause of a thing, and there is also a subsequent necessity arising from the thing
itself. Thus, when the heavens are said to revolve, it is an antecedent and efficient necessity, for they must revolve. But when I say that you speak of necessity, because you are speaking, this is nothing but a subsequent and inoperative necessity. For I only mean that it is impossible
<pb n="277" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_277.html" id="vi.iii.xviii-Page_277"/> for you to speak and not to speak at the same time, and not that some one compels you to speak. For the force of its own nature makes the heaven revolve; but no necessity obliges you to speak. But wherever
there is an antecedent necessity, there is also a subsequent one; but not <i>vice versa</i>. For we can say that the heaven revolves of necessity, because it revolves; but it is not likewise true that, because you speak, you do it of necessity. This subsequent necessity pertains to everything, so that we say: Whatever has been, necessarily has been. Whatever is, must be. Whatever is to be, of necessity will be. This is that necessity which Aristotle treats of (<span lang="la" id="vi.iii.xviii-p4.1"><span lang="la" id="vi.iii.xviii-p4.2">&#8220;<i>de propositionibus singularibus et futuris</i>&#8220;</span></span>), and which seems to destroy any alternative and to ascribe a necessity to all things. By this subsequent and imperative necessity, was it necessary (since the belief and prophecy concerning Christ were true, that he would die of his own free will), that it should be so. For this he became man; for this he did and suffered all things undertaken by him; for this he chose as he did. For therefore were they
necessary, because they were to be, and they were to be because they were, and they were because they were; and, if you wish to know the real necessity of all things which he did and suffered, know that they were of necessity, because he wished them to be. But no necessity preceded his will. Wherefore if they were not save by his will, then, had he not willed they would not have existed. So then, no one took his life from him, but he laid it down of himself and took it again; for he had power
to lay it down and to take it again, as he himself said.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xviii-p5"><i>Boso.</i> You have satisfied me that it cannot be proved that he was subjected to death by any necessity
<pb n="278" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_278.html" id="vi.iii.xviii-Page_278"/>; and I cannot regret my importunity in urging you to make this explanation.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xviii-p6"><i>Anselm.</i> I think we have shown with sufficient clearness how it was that God took a man without sin from a sinful substance; but I would on no account deny that there is no other explanation than this which we have given, for God can certainly do what human reason cannot grasp. But since this appears adequate, and since in search of other arguments we should involve ourselves in such questions as that of original sin, and how it was transmitted by our first
parents to all mankind, except this man of whom we are speaking; and since, also, we should be drawn into various other questions, each demanding its own separate consideration; let us be satisfied with this account of the matter, and go on to complete our intended work.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xviii-p7"><i>Boso.</i> As you choose; but with this condition that, by the help of God, you will sometime give this other explanation, which you owe me, as it were, but which now you avoid discussing.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xviii-p8"><i>Anselm.</i> Inasmuch as I entertain this desire myself, I will not refuse you; but because of the uncertainty of future events, I dare not promise you, but commend it to the will of God. But say now, what remains to be unravelled with regard to the question which you proposed in the first place, and which involves many others with it?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xviii-p9"><i>Boso.</i> The substance of the inquiry was this, why God became man, for the purpose of saving men by his death, when he could have done it in some other way. And you, by numerous and positive reasons, have shown that the restoring of mankind ought not to take place, and could not, without man paid the 
<pb n="279" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_279.html" id="vi.iii.xviii-Page_279"/>debt which he owed God for his sin. And this debt was so great that, while none but man must solve the debt, none but God was able to do it; so that he who
does it must be both God and man. And hence arises a necessity that God should take man into unity with his own person; so that he who in his own nature was bound to pay the debt, but could not, might be able to do it in the person of God. In fine, you have shown that that man, who was also God, must be formed from the virgin, and from the person of the Son of God, and that he could be taken without sin, though from a sinful substance. Moreover, you have clearly shown the life of this man to
have been so excellent and so glorious as to make ample satisfaction for the sins of the whole world, and even infinitely more. It now, therefore, remains to be shown how that payment is made to God for the sins of men.</p>

for himself and not compelled by others, who deserved nothing of him but punishment, gave so precious a life, even the life of so illustrious a personage, with such willingness.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xix-p7"><i>Boso.</i> You very nearly meet my wishes; but suffer me to make one inquiry, which you may think foolish, but which, nevertheless, I find no easy thing to answer. You say that when he died he gave what he did not owe. But no one will deny that it was better for him, or that so doing he pleased God more than if he had not done it. Nor will any one say that he was not bound to do what was best to be done, and what 
<pb n="281" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_281.html" id="vi.iii.xix-Page_281"/>he knew would be more pleasing to God. How
then can we affirm that he did not owe God the thing which he did, that is, the thing which he knew to be best and most pleasing to God, and especially since every creature owes God all that he is and all that he knows and all that he is capable of?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xix-p8"><i>Anselm.</i> Though the creature has nothing of himself, yet when God grants him the liberty of doing or not doing a thing, he leaves the alternative with him, so that, though one is better than the other, yet neither is positively demanded. And, whichever he does, it may be said that he ought to do it; and if he takes the better choice, he deserves a reward; because he renders freely what is his own. For, though celibacy be better than marriage, yet neither is
absolutely enjoined upon man; so that both he who chooses marriage and he who prefers celibacy, may be said to do as they ought. For no one says that either celibacy or marriage ought not to be chosen; but we say that what a man esteems best before taking action upon any of these things, this he ought to do. And if a man preserves his celibacy as a free gift offered to God, he looks for a reward. When you say that the creature owes God what he knows to be the better choice, and what he is able
to do, if you mean that he owes it as a debt, without implying any command on the part of God, it is not always true. Thus, as I have already said, a man is not bound to celibacy as a debt, but ought to marry if he prefers it. And if you are unable to understand the use of this word <span lang="la" id="vi.iii.xix-p8.1"><span lang="la" id="vi.iii.xix-p8.2">&#8220;<i>debere</i>,&#8221;</span></span> when no debt is implied, let me inform you that we use the word <span lang="la" id="vi.iii.xix-p8.3"><span lang="la" id="vi.iii.xix-p8.4">&#8220;<i>debere</i>&#8220;</span></span>
precisely as we sometimes do the words <span lang="la" id="vi.iii.xix-p8.5"><span lang="la" id="vi.iii.xix-p8.6">&#8220;<i>posse</i>, &#8221;</span></span> and <span lang="la" id="vi.iii.xix-p8.7"><span lang="la" id="vi.iii.xix-p8.8">&#8220;<i>non posse</i>, &#8221;</span></span> and also <span lang="la" id="vi.iii.xix-p8.9"><span lang="la" id="vi.iii.xix-p8.10">&#8220;<i>necessitas</i>,&#8221;</span></span> when the ability, etc., is not in the things 
<pb n="282" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_282.html" id="vi.iii.xix-Page_282"/>themselves, but in something else. When, for instance, we say that the poor ought to receive alms from the rich, we mean that the rich ought to bestow alms upon the
poor. For this is a debt not owed by the poor but by the rich. We also say that God ought to be exalted over all, not because there is any obligation resting upon him, but because all things ought to be subject to him. And he wishes that all creatures should be what they ought; for what God wishes to be ought to be. And, in like manner, when any creature wishes to do a thing that is left entirely at his own disposal, we say that he ought to do it, for what he wishes to be ought to be. So our
Lord Jesus, when he wished, as we have said, to suffer death, ought to have done precisely what he did; because he ought to be what he wished, and was not bound to do anything as a debt. As he is both God and man, in connection with his human nature, which made him a man, he must also have received from the Divine nature that control over himself which freed him from all obligation, except to do as he chose. In like manner, as one person of the Trinity, he must have had whatever he possessed of
his own right, so as to be complete in himself, and could not have been under obligations to another, nor have need of giving anything in order to be repaid himself.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xix-p9"><i>Boso.</i> Now I see clearly that he did not give himself up to die for the honor of God, as a debt; for this my own reason proves, and yet he ought to have done what he did.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xix-p10"><i>Anselm.</i> That honor certainly belongs to the whole Trinity; and, since he is very God, the Son of God, he offered himself for his own honor, as well as for that of the Father and the Holy Spirit; that is, he 
<pb n="283" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_283.html" id="vi.iii.xix-Page_283"/>gave his humanity to his divinity, which is one person of the Triune God. But, though we express our idea more definitely by clinging to the precise truth, yet we may say, according to our custom, that the Son freely gave himself to the Father. For
thus we plainly affirm that in speaking of one person we understand the whole Deity, to whom as man he offered himself. And, by the names of Father and Son, a wondrous depth of devotion is excited in the hearts of the hearers, when it is said that the Son supplicates the Father on our behalf.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xix-p11"><i>Boso.</i> This I readily acknowledge.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="vi.iii.xx-p1">How human salvation follows upon his death.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p2"><i>Anselm.</i> Let us now observe, if we can, how the salvation of men rests on this.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p3"><i>Boso.</i> This is the very wish of my heart. For, although I think I understand you, yet I wish to get from you the close chain of argument.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p4"><i>Anselm.</i> There is no need of explaining how precious was the gift which the Son freely gave.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p5"><i>Boso.</i> That is clear enough already.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p6"><i>Anselm.</i> But you surely will not think that he deserves no reward, who freely gave so great a gift to God.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p7"><i>Boso.</i> I see that it is necessary for the Father to reward the Son; else he is either unjust in not wishing to do it, or weak in not being able to do it; but neither of these things can be attributed to God.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p8"><i>Anselm.</i> He who rewards another either gives him something which he does not have, or else remits some rightful claim upon him. But anterior to the 
<pb n="284" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_284.html" id="vi.iii.xx-Page_284"/>great offering of the Son, all things belonging to the Father were his, nor did he ever owe anything which could be forgiven him. How then can a reward be bestowed on one who needs nothing, and to whom no gift or release can be made?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p9"><i>Boso.</i> I see on the one hand a necessity for a reward, and on the other it appears impossible; for God must necessarily render payment for what he owes, and yet there is no one to receive it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p10"><i>Anselm.</i> But if a reward so large and so deserved is not given to him or any one else, then it will almost appear as if the Son had done this great work in vain.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p11"><i>Boso.</i> Such a supposition is impious.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p12"><i>Anselm.</i> The reward then must be bestowed upon some one else, for it cannot be upon him.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p13"><i>Boso.</i> This is necessarily so.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p14"><i>Anselm.</i> Had the Son wished to give some one else what was due to him, could the Father rightfully prevent it, or refuse to give it to the other person?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p15"><i>Boso.</i> No! but I think it would be both just and necessary that the gift should be given by the Father to whomsoever the Son wished; because the Son should be allowed to give away what is his own, and the Father cannot bestow it at all except upon some other person.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p16"><i>Anselm.</i> Upon whom would he more properly bestow the reward accruing from his death, than upon those for whose salvation, as right reason teaches, he became man; and for whose sake, as we have already said, he left an example of suffering death to preserve holiness? For surely in vain will men imitate him, if they be not also partakers of his reward. Or whom could he more justly make heirs of the inheritance, which he does not need, and of the superfluity of
his 
<pb n="285" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_285.html" id="vi.iii.xx-Page_285"/>possessions, than his parents and brethren? What more proper than that, when he beholds so many of them weighed down by so heavy a debt, and wasting through poverty, in the depth of their miseries, he should remit the debt incurred by their sins, and give them what their transgressions had forfeited?</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p17"><i>Boso.</i> The universe can hear of nothing more reasonable, more sweet, more desirable. And I receive such confidence from this that I cannot describe the joy with which my heart exults. For it seems to me that God can reject none who come to him in his name.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p18"><i>Anselm.</i> Certainly not, if he come aright. And the Scriptures, which rest on solid truth as on a firm foundation, and which, by the help of God, we have somewhat examined,&#8212;the Scriptures, I say, show us how to approach in order to share such favor, and how we ought to live under it.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p19"><i>Boso.</i> And whatever is built on this foundation is founded on an immovable rock.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xx-p20"><i>Anselm.</i> I think I have nearly enough answered your inquiry, though I might do it still more fully, and there are doubtless many reasons which are beyond me and which mortal ken does not reach. It is also plain that God had no need of doing the thing spoken of, but eternal truth demanded it. For though God is said to have done what that man did, on account of the personal union made; yet God was in no need of descending from heaven to conquer the devil, nor
of contending against him in holiness to free mankind. But God demanded that man should conquer the devil, so that he who had offended by sin should atone by holiness. As God owed nothing to the devil but punishment, so man must only make amends by 
<pb n="286" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_286.html" id="vi.iii.xx-Page_286"/>conquering the devil as man had already been conquered by him. But whatever was demanded of man, he owed to God and not to the devil.</p>

For what compassion can excel these words of the Father, addressed to the sinner doomed to eternal torments and having no way of escape: &#8220;Take my only begotten Son and make him an offering for yourself;&#8221; or these words
of the Son: &#8220;Take me, and ransom your souls.&#8221; For these are the voices they utter, when inviting and leading us to faith in the Gospel. Or can anything be more just than for him to remit all debt since he has earned a reward greater than all debt, if given with the love which he deserves.</p>

<p class="SectionInfo" id="vi.iii.xxii-p2">How it is impossible for the devil to be reconciled.</p>

<p class="PFirst" id="vi.iii.xxii-p3">IF you carefully consider the scheme of human salvation, you will perceive the reconciliation of the devil, of which you made inquiry, to be impossible. For, as man could not be reconciled but by the death of the God-man, by whose holiness the loss occasioned by man&#8217;s sin should be made up; so fallen angels cannot be saved but by the death of a God-angel who by his holiness may repair the evil occasioned by the 
<pb n="287" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_287.html" id="vi.iii.xxii-Page_287"/>sins of his companions. And as man must not be
restored by a man of a different race, though of the same nature, so no angel ought to be saved by any other angel, though all were of the same nature, for they are not like men, all of the same race. For all angels were not sprung from one, as all men were. And there is another objection to their restoration, viz , that, as they fell with none to plot their fall, so they must rise with none to aid them; but this is impossible. But otherwise they cannot be restored to their original dignity.
For, had they not sinned, they would have been confirmed in virtue without any foreign aid, simply by the power given to them from the first. And, therefore, if any one thinks that the redemption of our Lord ought to be extended even to the fallen angels, he is convinced by reason, for by reason he has been deceived. And I do not say this as if to deny that the virtue of his death far exceeds all the sins of men and angels, but because infallible reason rejects the reconciliation of the fallen
angels.</p>

And by the solution of the single question proposed do I see the truth of all that is contained in the Old and New Testament. For, in proving that God became man by necessity, leaving out what was taken from the Bible, viz., the remarks on the persons of the Trinity, and on Adam, you convince both Jews and Pagans by the mere force of reason. And the God-man himself originates

<pb n="288" href="/ccel/anselm/basic_works/Page_288.html" id="vi.iii.xxiii-Page_288"/>the New Testament and approves the Old. And, as we must acknowledge him to be true, so no one can dissent from anything contained in these books.</p>

<p class="PContinue" id="vi.iii.xxiii-p4"><i>Anselm.</i> If we have said anything that needs correction, I am willing to make the correction if it be a reasonable one.
